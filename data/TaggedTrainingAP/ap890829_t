<TEXT>
 The father of three purported drug barons begged the government on Tuesday to end its fierce anti-narcotics drive and negotiate peace, as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> moved to extradite a reputed drug finance chief to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The developments came as the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> was hit by seven bombs. Police also said Tuesday night they frustrated a planned rocket attack on a state-owned distillery there. Four imported, high-powered rockets were found aimed at an alcohol storage tank outside the <LOCATION> Licores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a police spokesmen said. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, identified as a major financial man for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, was told by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> authorities Tuesday they plan to hand him over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial, Colombian television said. According to the Tuesday night report by the private syndicated news program <ORGANIZATION> Noticiero </ORGANIZATION> 24 <ORGANIZATION> Horas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was formally notified during the day of plans to extradite him. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel is the world's largest cocaine trafficking organization. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is wanted by a federal court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on charges related to a $ 1.2 billion drug money-laundering operation. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was told he had until Tuesday to appeal the extradition, the report said. It was the first word that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had completed extradition paperwork and made a formal request for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a 35-year-old econmist. He was the first of at least four extraditable suspects to be caught up in a sweep aimed at drug traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has said it will not comment on any extradition proceedings. The <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> case is seen as a test of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s resolve to press its attack on drug dealers. They have cowed the courts in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country through assassinations, threats and bribes. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, the father of three reputed cocaine kingpins, appealed in an open letter to President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to bury the hatchet and agree to talk to the drug barons. `` Let there be dialogue, let there be peace, let's have forgiveness, let's carry out a kind of erasing and clean slate,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> wrote. The letter was published on Tuesday in a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> reiterated the Barco government's refusal to negotiate with drug traffickers, who are blamed for the assassination Aug. 18 of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate. The slaying led to the crackdown on drug trafficking. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s police intelligence chief said Tuesday that among the more than 11,000 people arrested in the crackdown, one has been implicated in <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s death. Earlier, news reports pointed to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Majuat </PERSON>, reputedly a top financial man for drug dealers, but the reports could not be confirmed. Bombs exploded at six state liquor stores Tuesday in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The shops are a source of patronage for political leaders. A seventh bomb went off outside a tourist agency office in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. No one was hurt, police said. They estimated damage at $ 100,000. A man who identified himself as a spokesman for drug traffickers claimed responsibility for the bombings Tuesday and nine bombs that exploded in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Sunday. The claim came in phone calls to <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> radio stations. In his emotional appeal, which was dated Saturday and appeared in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> called on Barco to `` stop the bloodshed in our poor and dear <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' `` Nobody in the world ever won a war, all that is left are orphans, widows and pained mothers,'' said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, 65. He said traffickers should be called on `` to stop dead'' their activities, `` no more drug trafficking, no more war, no more killings, no more bombs, no more fire.'' He identified himself in the letter as `` father of three extraditables. The poor little ones, may God shelter them.'' Neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nor Colombian authorities have accused <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> of trafficking. But his three sons, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazsquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, are alleged to be among the kingpins of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and are wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Drug agents believe the cartel is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> said traffickers facing extradition `` say they prefer a tomb in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to a jail cell for life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is to be dead in life, as are so many that we have there. In this I think they're right.'' He said any negotiated concessions by the traffickers would also require concessions by leftist guerrillas. The traffickers allegedly have equipped and financed right-wing paramilitary death squads that have killed hundreds of suspected leftists and provided security and assassination services for the traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and also the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a confidential report by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> security forces, reported that at least five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and 11 British mercenaries helped train teams of assassins for Colombian cocaine traffickers and their right-wing allies. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it asked <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to investigate allegations some of its citizens were involved. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> pledged Tuesday to continue to fight her country's drug lords despite death threats, and she appealed for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to protect judges. She disputed reports that she had considered resigning in the face of death threats against her, her husband and their 3-year-old son. She said she was requesting $ 19 million to purchase armored cars, bulletproof vests, metal detectors for courts and other security devices. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has approved $ 65 million to help the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government fight the drug cartels and $ 5 million to help protect judges.

 Two years ago, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> was in a Soviet labor camp, ostracized and imprisoned by his government for what it called slander. Today, he is among a new breed of globe-trotting <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> activists flocking to the West to pitch their causes, attend seminars, meet government leaders and finally shake hands with people whose stubborn support kept many of them going. Unlike Soviet tourists and emigrants, these activists also are forging new contacts with people who will support them when they return home. Along the way they are amassing an arsenal of donated computers, printers and FAX machines to open new, electronic windows on the once-closed Soviet society. The number of activists visiting the West has soared since 1986, the year after President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched his reforms. They range from veteran <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents who spent years in jail for their beliefs to pro-independence Baltic activists spurred by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s programs. Nearly every top leader of the three independent `` popular front'' groups in the Baltic republics has visited <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in the last year. Leading <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> activists such as <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalyov </PERSON> have crossed both continents, and Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has returned to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> twice since his first visit last year. But Soviet authorities still tightly control travel visas for personal and business trips, leaving wide speculation about the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s motives for allowing activists to ply their trade freely abroad. `` I'd shy away from conspiracy theories, but it obviously builds up <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reputation. He obviously believes enough in his reforms to allow this,'' said <PERSON> Ginte </PERSON> <PERSON> Damusis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants to appear as a peaceful ... law-abiding figure,'' said <PERSON> Ludmilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, Soviet affairs director at the New York-based human rights organization <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` They do n't want bad publicity. <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Laber </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, suggested the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> simply is less concerned about activists' influence `` Somebody there has realized it's not so bad when these people speak out.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said only that <LOCATION> Kremlim </LOCATION> policy on visas for travel to the West does n't discriminate between activists and all other Soviet travelers, whose total number could reach 2 million this year. <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, president of the Lithuanian independence movement <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't know why authorities let him visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but that he had more important things on his mind. `` There is an opportunity to maintain contacts, to establish new contacts,'' the 56-year-old musicologist said through an interpreter last month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I hope that <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> will be known not just by name only, but as a very real movement and representative of its people, its nation.'' <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, who became an activist only in the last two years, said his trip reaffirmed <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>' rejection of Soviet authority, imposed on the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> under a 1939 pact signed by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. `` We're raising questions about the authority of our representatives abroad. Can we expect emigres or other governments to represent us?'' He met with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, congressmen, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> policymaker and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, which has appointed a representative to deal with <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s fledgling independent labor union Just a few weeks before, the 48-year-old <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> met with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other officials and activists and signed an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to fax daily installments of his journal to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, the Georgian publisher of the journal Glasnost, was freed in 1987 after four years in a labor camp for publishing an underground journal. He formally came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman would not comment on any of the meetings, saying only that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is to meet with all Soviet activists. `` One of their intentions for contacts with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is to be so well known that if a crackdown came, they'd be well known enough to protect themselves,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvaners </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The fact that these people are coming to the West, showing their faces, gives -LRB- Westerners -RRB- a stake personally in their fate.'' The activists also are `` seeing us working and they get an idea about how they could work. They see participation in a real parliamentary democracy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Voren </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bukovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. But ideas and contacts are n't the only things activists take home. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> a list of supplies, from staples to computers, for his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> office, which was stripped by <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents and <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> forces last year. <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> said she was n't sure if all his requests were filled, but that his wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, earlier in the year had carried a personal computer back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after visiting the West. <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> picked up a desktop publishing system with which <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> hopes to put out a daily newspaper from <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the Lithuanian capital. Baltic, Armenian and <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists regularly use fax machines they got from the West to send dispatches to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> activists, the recipients said. `` One fax can perform miracles,'' said <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudava </PERSON>, executive director of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> `` They can stop all this travel. ... But they can not cut all the telephone lines.'' The center receives daily dispatches from the human rights journal Express-Khronika and translates them for Western media. Such independent reporting will make <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> think twice before sending troops against protesters, <PERSON> Gudava </PERSON> said. `` It's impossible now to keep information inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about such things,'' he said. Still, nothing can replace face-to-face contact, said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Voren </PERSON>. `` They would be doing their jobs even without these trips. But it's easier to discuss things in person _ you know, they still have bugs in their offices.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guerrillas on the 6,000-foot volcano looming over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s northwestern limits have turned the working-class neighborhood of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> into another bullet-pocked battlefront. Contingents of leftist rebels have come down the slopes four times in nine months to attack an army post in the center of the ramshackle district of 30,000 people. The attacks are part of a year-old guerrilla campaign to bring their war against the government into the capital. The Salvadoran military says the guerrillas are making urban attacks because they've failed elsewhere. But three of the four raids were staged in daylight, illustrating the guerrillas' confidence in their ability to at least partly neutralize the government's single greatest tactical advantage: air power. `` Each time the combat is more fierce,'' said <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, a vendor in the stall-lined market alley hard hit by the fighting. `` It will happen again, and next time it will be worse.'' She stood 10 feet from the spot where <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, a 60-year-old mason, was killed by a bullet in the head the afternoon of Aug. 1. That raid also left a soldier dead, another wounded and two civilians _ a market-stall owner and her daughter _ wounded. Three of <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>'s grandchildren stood on the stoop of his humble cinder-block home and told how they huddled under beds while the fighting raged for two hours. Asked if the attacks made her afraid to come to the market, 16-year-old cheese-seller <PERSON> Julieta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said, `` Yes. But necessity obliges us to risk our lives.'' Though residents of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> have nothing against the soldiers manning the post, several said there is a feeling that the detachment should be withdrawn, or at least moved from the district's center. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s arm is still bandaged and in a sling from a wound he received in November during the first attack on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>. He had stopped to light a cigarette for a soldier when the first fusillade exploded out of the darkness. The bone in the 21-year-old bus fare-taker's upper arm was shattered, the artery severed and much of the nerve destroyed. `` They should remove the post to a more isolated place,'' he said, standing a block from the one-story house that serves as the 15-man detachment's headquarters and barracks. The house is distinguished from its neighbors by green-and-black camouflage daub and sandbag positions at its corners. `` There are too many people around here _ the market, the school, the church, people who have nothing to do with the conflict _ and things happen to them,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. Sgt. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a stocky 51-year-old former paratrooper, commands the post. A 32-year army veteran, <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON> lost a lung from a wound suffered in combat with the rebels in 1982. Standing next to a patched hole in the wall where an antitank rocket struck in the previous attack, <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON> said his detachment was there `` to protect the community from these terrorist delinquents.'' He estimated that about 100 rebels took part in the attack Aug. 1. His troops were reinforced soon after it began by scores of 1st Brigade soldiers on constant patrol around the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano's base. A UH-1H helicopter with two M-60 machine-guns _ one of 70 U.S.-supplied choppers in the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> air force _ circled about 3,000 feet above <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> shortly after the battle began, too high for its gunfire to be effective. The helicopters are n't coming in as close as they used to because the guerrillas have acquired several hundred Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles, which have a range of 800 yards, compared with about 300 yards for an ordinary assault rifle. The helicopters have been taking more hits and abandoning more missions. With government air power reduced, the rebels have been able to launch more daytime attacks than at any time in the last four years of the conflict that began nearly a decade ago. Ventura contended his post is getting ever-greater acceptance and support from the local people. `` They're tiring of seeing the way the terrorists' actions affect the civilian population,'' he said. But a dozen residents interviewed indicated little or no animosity toward the attackers. It was clear, however, they were sick of the war. `` One asks oneself whey the two sides are fighting, and one does n't find an answer,'' said a produce vendor who preferred not to give her name. Even <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> says he has nothing against the rebel who wounded him so severely. `` It was just bad luck,'' he said.

 `` Good evening, the headlines tonight,'' <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawley </PERSON> tells BBC-TV viewers. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has sent a warning to <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>: we will stand by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> whatever the consequences.'' There's an eerie quality to `` News 39,'' a weeklong series of mock newscasts that marries 50-year-old old footage to high-tech TV to recreate the last days before World War II. With her reassuringly English tones, as well as the period jewelry she bought especially for the program, this doyenne of British television seems born to the role of wartime newscaster. But at 43, Ms. <PERSON> Lawley </PERSON> was n't even born when the war ended. And computer graphics have an unsettling impact as they mingle with grainy black-and-white photos of helmeted Germans and gas-masked babies. The reporters on the 15-minute news roundups are real, like <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>, reporting on evacuees coming home from the Continent, or <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent, now `` reporting from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'' and appearing in color against a backdrop of the <ORGANIZATION> Brandenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> in black and white. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is being deluged with memories of Sept. 1-3, 1939, when <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> declared war on <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The TV schedules are saturated with documentaries and drama. Newspapers are publishing special supplements. More than 100 new books about the war are being published, from fresh histories to coffee-table volumes of photographs. The emphasis is on the small, almost forgotten details of life on the home front. `` News 39'' even claims to have unearthed a 50-year-old scoop: newly discovered footage of crowds falling over rubber balls that were strewn by an anti-war protester outside the prime minister's Downing Street residence This week `` will be a time of sadness for many. For some it will bring a nostalgic smile, a memory of a small but personal part in history,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, managing director of BBC-TV. `` For those born after the event it will be a time to learn what happened and why.'' But for some, it's too much. `` All those trench coats. All those tin hats. All those smiling cockneys with a mug of tea amid the sepia ruins of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. I ca n't face it. I'm off,'' wrote <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pile </PERSON>, an iconoclastic Sunday Times columnist. For most Britons, the war years have taken on a burnished, nostalgic glow, where `` there is never any doubt where the division between good and evil lies, and where there will always eventually be a happy ending,'' as <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> put it in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. But although the collective memory is of a nation united, making huge sacrifices in the noblest of causes, the anniversary is also reopening old controversies. Historians once again are debating whether the pre-war British government, in seeking to appease <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s territorial demands in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was abjectly craven or playing for time to rearm. There is even a debate about whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should have joined the war. That argument was rekindled by <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowling </PERSON>, who argued in The Sunday Telegraph that from a purely conservative viewpoint, a victorious <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would have been preferable to a postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> dominated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. By staying out of the war, he wrote, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would have allowed <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to destroy its natural enemy, Bolshevism, and left the British empire intact. `` It is wrong to assume that a dominant <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would have been more intolerable to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was to become, or that British statesmen had a duty to risk British lives to prevent <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> behaving intolerably to Germans and others,'' he wrote. Cowling conceded that `` these are harsh judgments which will be offensive to men of good will,'' and the flood of outraged responses to the Telegraph proved him right. Professor <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allbone </PERSON>, who worked on the development of the atomic bomb, wrote that had it stayed out, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would eventually have come under the domination of a nuclear-armed <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Other historians said the empire already was disintegrating before the war, and <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Glendevon </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> minister, wrote that the war saved civilization, `` and I am deeply thankful that I was old enough to join in.''

<TEXT>
 Two years of bombardment have made a ruin of this former royal city named for <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, who may have founded it, but flowers brighten the rubble. Roses and mimosa, jasmine and bougainvillea cover the serrated remains of buildings in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, which was the seat of Afghan kings two centuries ago. Block after block of mud-walled dwellings that were bombed, rocketed and shelled by Moslem guerrillas and Afghan soldiers have been transformed into ghost neighborhoods of jagged walls and collapsed archways, twisted beams and shattered wooden roofs. Other buildings are heavily damaged by bullets and shrapnel. Some are boarded up and locked. What remains, often compared to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, is a monument to the suffering caused by 11 years of war since the communist coup of 1978, in which Soviet military forces took part for nine years. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew in February. Even army officers and government officials are half-hearted in trying to blame the destruction solely on the guerrillas, most of whose arms are supplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Every day the Soviets were here was a disaster,'' an army officer said privately. `` All they touched turned to dust. Now that we are on our own, every day gets a little better.'' Guerrillas have tried since October 1987 to capture <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, whose name derives from the Arabic for <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. The conqueror's army passed through in 329 B.C. For centuries after that, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION> fought over <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, which was strategically located on the central Asian trade routes. Since early May, the government has claimed that guerrillas _ known as the mujahedeen, or holy warriors _ and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> soldiers were planning a new assault on the city. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> is 70 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the main guerrilla groups are based. Most guerrilla commanders deny the charge, and say instead that they agreed seven months ago to stop attacks on the city and turn their rockets and mortars on army posts and on the airport 15 miles north of the city. `` For every communist killed, as many as 100 innocent people may die'' if the city is shelled, said commander <PERSON> Mulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Naqib </PERSON> of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of Afghansitan, considered the best-organized and most efficient fighting group. `` These are the people who helped us against the Russians,'' he said. `` These are the people who gave us food and protection at a time when we were getting no outside aid. Why should we kill or hurt them?'' <PERSON> Naqib </PERSON> commands about 4,000 of the estimated 20,000 guerrillas around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, which was <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city before the war. Only one of the seven often-feuding resistance groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ the fundamenalist <LOCATION> Hebz-i-Islami </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- led by <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> _ has refused to stop shelling the city, the field commanders said. Some said they may be forced to save some weapons and ammunition to fight <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s men. Government officials said the population fell from 300,000 to about 25,000 when the bombardment was at its heaviest. Residents who fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have begun returning, even though up to 30 rockets still hit the city every day. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Nurul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON>, military governor of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province, said: `` Seventy percent of the buildings in the city have been completely destroyed. The remaining 30 percent have been hit by at least one bullet.'' Workers have begun building playgrounds for children and repairing badly minarets on neighborhood mosques. In the battered shops of the bazaar, teen-age boys in turbans inspect Japanese-made electronics goods and women in full-length veils bargain with vendors for grapes and melons. People travel on bicycles and donkeys, on horses sometimes decorated with silver bells and brightly colored woolen balls, along paved streets chewed up by tanks. Most gasoline stations are closed for lack of supplies, so nearly all the motor traffic is military. `` Two years ago, on any day of the week at any hour of the day, you could n't leave your house,'' the army officer said, driving past rows of shattered government houses. `` This is still war, but it's just not as bad. Soldiers and guerrillas are within yards of each other in two rings around the city, but appear to be observing a comparative truce, at least for a time. `` We all want the same thing,'' <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said. He is a member of the <PERSON> Durrani </PERSON> tribe, which produced the kings of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> until the monarch was overthrown in 1973. `` The government, the mujahedeen, the refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the West all want the same thing. We want to live together in peace,'' he said in an interview at his office in Governor's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where portraits of the former kings hang. `` We were friends before the war. We can be friends in the future.'' Guerrilla commanders feel, however, that talking with President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is tantamout to accepting the Soviet legacy from a war that has cost more than 1 million lives. `` We have problems with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his government,'' <PERSON> Naqib </PERSON> said. `` They are still the enemy. Maybe we'll see each other and sit down and talk. God willing, one day we will. But now is n't the right time.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> will press on with an effort to kill <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s proposed $ 500 million Two Forks dam because of the damage it would cause to the environment, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. The 615-foot-high dam to be built near the confluence of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> would flood 30 miles of scenic river valley and canyon and the town of <LOCATION> Deckers </LOCATION> to provide drinking water for up to 360,000 new Denver-area residents. Opponents, including several environmental groups, have called the project `` the biggest ecological disaster'' in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> history. `` The Two Forks dam and reservoir project would result in the loss of a major aquatic resource which provides irreplaceable stream fishery habitat and recreational resources near the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deputy regional administrator from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who reviewed the project for five months. <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said he was recommending continuation of the veto process started by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> on March 24. The next step in the process is two months of public hearings. The final decision will be made at <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said vetoes are rarely overturned. `` I caution that there are still powerful forces aligned against us,'' Two Forks opponent Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said in a statement released by his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office `` You simply ca n't leave us high and dry,'' Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. `` We have not been given a fair, objective appraisal of this project.'' <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said in response to <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>'s remarks: `` I'm not happy they're upset. But I'm obliged to carry out my responsibilities under the law.'' Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, a onetime Two Forks supporter, was noncommittal about DeHihns' decision. He said he hoped the cooperation forged between <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and its suburbs in their drive to build the project would not deteriorate. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> had two options besides continuing the veto process _ letting the project proceed or attaching additional environmental requirements that would have to be met before the project could proceed. But after more than 160 hours of meetings with Two Forks backers and foes, DeHihns' apparently remained unconvinced the project could be built without inflicting serious environmental damage. The dam 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> was proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and 42 area water providers. They said the dam is needed to meet <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s future water needs. <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> appears to have adequate water supplies for now, and could put more water conservation measures in place. `` This is not just a statement to the people of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb. `` We should hear this message too.'' Environmental groups said the dam would flood a premier trout stream and dry up wildlife habitat in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> opposes the project. <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruetz </PERSON> denied the downstream habitat would dry up if the dam were built. Another board member, <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>, said the agency would challenge DeHihns' decision and demand more <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> involvement in future <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> water decisions. <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> said DeHihns deserves `` the heartfelt praise and gratitude of all concerned Americans'' because of his decision. `` This recommendation brings us one step closer to a total victory for common sense and for the environment,'' said <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassen </PERSON> of the Environmental Defense Fund. `` There are less costly and less destructive ways to supply the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area with water.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> enters an uncertain phase Friday when the calendar runs out on the ousted president's term, leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with nobody to recognize as legal head of the country The situation raises a number of touchy situations, such as notifying Panamanian officials when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval vessel plans to search a Panamanian-flag ship suspected of carrying drugs. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted in February 1988 by forces loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused to recognize that ouster, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has continued to look upon <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legal authority even though he wields no power. But Friday is the date when <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was supposed to step down officially as president, according to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitution. With that date, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's withdraws the mantle of legitimacy it accorded to <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. In the absence of even a paper successor, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not have anyone it recognizes as president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The end of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s term also means that his envoy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, will surrender control of the Panamanian Embassy here. The building will remain under the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s care until a democratically elected government taks office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has found an apartment here and plans to look for a job. Officials acknowledge they do n't know what will happen in cases such as those involving the inspection of Panamanian ships. For the past 18 months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval vessels encountering Panamanian-flag ships suspected of carrying illicit narcotics have secured permission from <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> before inspecting these vessels. It is normal for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to recognize whatever authority is in effective control in a foreign country, but an exception was made in the case of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s refusal to have official dealings with the Noriega-dominated government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> The campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> began in earnest after two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries indicted him on drug-smuggling charges in February 1988. In practical terms, the end of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s term in office will mean little. Having spent much of the time since his ouster living in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with only a small base of popular support, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been largely irrelevant as a political factor since he was deposed. His downfall occurred when he attempted to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military forces. Within hours, the Noriega-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted to fire him as president and to replace him with <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalist. After Friday, it is not clear what will happen in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Authorities there recognize the constitutional significance of that date but there is no officially recognized successor to <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> because the May 7 national election results were voided by the government after the anti-Noriega candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, appeared to have won by a wide margin. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration recognizes <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as `` president-elect'' but officials said unless there is a swearing-in accompanied by the appointment of a cabinet, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no one to recognize. The administration had hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> would be able to promote a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But that effort broke down last week, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seems to have emerged with his power intact. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said afterward the administration may tighten economic sanctions which were imposed against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last year after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is moving to withdraw from the market the second of two generic versions of a popular drug used to treat high blood pressure. However, the company that makes the drug contends that it's safe and effective. In the third such action in less than a week, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> proposed Monday to remove <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s generic version of Dyazide because of questions about its therapeutic value The Copiague, N.Y.-based company said in a statement that its product remains on the market. `` It is safe, effective and may be used with assurance of clinical effectiveness,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that it will appeal the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action within the 30-day limit. Dyazide and its generic competitors are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the country and the generic version is <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s largest-selling product The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it `` has not been able to fully establish'' whether <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s product has the same effect as the brand-name product made by <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement is the result of confusion over a clerical error in the identification of samples used in safety testing and misinterpretation of the results of tests for safety and effectiveness conducted by the company last year. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said that while the proceeding to withdraw approval of the company's license to market its product is under way, it will indicate that the drug is not considered to be of proved therapeutic equivalence to the brand-name drug. If <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s generic Dyazide is withdrawn, there would be no generic version on the market. Generics are copies of brand-name drugs that sell for much lower prices. The other maker of a generic Dyazide, <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, halted distribution of its copy earlier this summer when the company said it substituted samples of the brand-name drug in tests required for <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> is among 11 drug makers being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption involving employees in the agency's generic drug division and some makers of generic drugs. The agency also is sampling 30 of the most prescribed generic drugs and their brand-name counterparts in the wake of disclosure that several generic drug companies have provided false data to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it found no evidence of fraud in the approval process for <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s generic Dyazide. Questions about the product's equivalence to the brand-name product stem from irregularities in the batch records for lots of the product that were tested, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it was proposing to withdraw approvals for three products made by Par Pharmaceuticals of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and 25 made by <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s action was praised by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, which has been looking into the agency's generic drug division `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is coming to grips with the problems in the generic drug industry,'' he said. `` I expect that after all is said and done both the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the generic industry will be stronger and better.''

<HEAD>Federal Job Turnover Rate is 9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 9 percent turnover rate among federal employees in 1987 is roughly comparable to private industry and may be about right for an employer as large as the government, says the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The board said Monday that it found a 5 percent turnover rate for many technical and engineering occupations such as computer specialists. That was `` contrary to conventional wisdom'' that turnover problems are more severe in those categories than other job descriptions, the board said. The board said its figures were virtually identical to those in a 1984 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and not far off the private sector turnover rates of 14 percent and 16 percent cited in two recent studies. After major differences are filtered out, `` federal employee turnover may not be as different from private sector turnover as believed by some,'' it said. One difference, for example, is that a private worker who moves from one company to another would count as a `` turnover,'' while a federal worker transfering from one department to another would not. Calling the overall government turnover rate `` relatively stable,'' the board said `` the current overall rate of turnover may be near optimal for an organization the size of the federal government.'' Of those leaving, 58 percent resigned, 25 percent retired, 5 percent were fired and 12 percent were unspecified `` other removals,'' the report said. The board based its report on an analysis of 1.4 million employee records from the 1987 fiscal year. Here are some highlights of the report: _ There was a 25 percent turnover rate among employees during their first year of service _ Only 4 percent of all employees with from 16 to 20 years of service left their jobs during the year reviewed _ Among those with more than 30 years' service, 20 percent retired in 1987 _ The average age of federal retirees, 60, is close to the average age of private sector retirees, which is about 61 to 62 _ Although they constitute only 26 percent of the work force, employees in the lowest five pay grades accounted for 55 percent of all resignations _ Turnover was highest among health-related and lower-level clerical and support occupations _ 19 percent of all practical nurses and 16 percent of all clerk-typists

<TEXT>
 The Energy Department may be unable to set a reliable date for completing a high-level nuclear waste dump in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> until it wins state permission to begin site studies, a senior department official says. In an interview Monday, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> indicated that squabbles with <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> pose a bigger obstacle than a court ruling last week against the department's proposed $ 1 billion contract award to a <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unit to manage the waste repository. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>, acting director of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radioactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the court ruling. Completion of the dump proposed for <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, originally was scheduled for 1998 and currently is set for 2003. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> state government and its congressional delegation oppose the project, in part on grounds that <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was chosen for political reasons rather than scientific reasons. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said earlier this summer he was reconsidering the project timetable in light of recent setbacks, and <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> said he expects a decision in the next few months on whether the schedule will be pushed back again. `` A meaningful schedule will probably depend on agreement with the state to go forward,'' <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> said. `` At some point _ there's no fixed point, but at some point _ we must have access'' to the site to perform the preliminary work. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> so far has refused to grant the environmental permits needed by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to begin drilling on the site to determine its geologic suitability. The department is obligated by a 1982 federal law to study the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> site. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> cited last week's court ruling against the contract award to <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> as an example of the program's lack of credibility. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Claims Court Judge <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> ruled on Thursday that the department may award the contract to no one but <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> was an unsuccessful bidder which sued on grounds that the department's means of selecting <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as manager was improper and unfair `` Over the short run, I ca n't see that that's a dramatic impact'' on the program, said <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>, unless it forces the department to abandon its plans to put a single company _ <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> or any other _ in charge of managing much of the project. Nuclear utilities are eager to see the repository built because some are being forced to spend millions of dollars to expand temporary waste storage facilities. Utilities customers pay $ 400 million a year into a fund for the permanent dump. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> also reiterated his denial of one of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>'s main charges: that his involvement in the contract award process was a conflict of interest. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> asserted that the award was tainted by the fact that <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> subcontractor, before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> said he worked for Science Applications for seven months before joining the department in 1986. The <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> contract proposal did not exist then, he said, adding that he has no continuing ties with Science Applications. `` I hold no pension rights, no favoritism, no job promises, no thoughts to that regard, and I do n't see where any conflict of interest has been shown,'' he said.

 Security for Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has been bolstered amid threats of political violence by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> drug lords, the governor confirmed Monday. `` There has been a general warning, a general concern of high-profile public officials on the subject of drugs,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told reporters. `` We've been rather active in dealing with the drug issue.'' The additional protection started this weekend after <ORGANIZATION> FDLE </ORGANIZATION> agents were told by federal sources that <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> drug lords threatened a political assassination in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> if any of the targeted drug dealers were extradited from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said.

He also serves as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lead governor on substance abuse and drug trafficking. Last Friday, the governor asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to extradite 25 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> drug fugitives should they be arrested by Colombian authorities. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he believed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials might be threatened because of the scheduled extradition Wednesday of a Colombian drug dealer. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> just feels a little bit more comfortable, at least in these next few days, being a little more cautious,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, director of operations for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said the governor's public schedule, which is normally published days in advance for distribution to the press, will now be on a day-to-day basis.

 Voyager's pictures of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> _ which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes _ might have been washed out if not for last-minute adjustments to the spacecraft's cameras, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says. `` It would n't have wiped out the mission, but would have made a lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON>, an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory `` It would have been an incredible disappointment.'' `` They would have been white images,'' Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said Monday. Meanwhile, scientists said the spacecraft found that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> is the coldest body ever measured in the solar system, and that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> has something in common with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>: smog. Only days before Voyager made its closest approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> last Thursday and zipped past <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, scientists recognized that the frosty surface of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s largest moon reflected much more light than originally expected, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Engineers compensated by sending Voyager new computer commands reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 6.68 seconds to 3.84 seconds for the best close-ups of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON> said. Those photographs revealed that giant craters, called calderas, once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square miles of lunar terrain. They also found what scientists believe are active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen particles 20 miles skyward. During its <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> encounter, Voyager's cameras discovered six moons in addition to <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were discovered from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. They also found three thin rings of debris and five broad rings encircling the solar system's fourth-largest planet. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in the coming months, said <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, manager of the flight engineering office. By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will be 2.76 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 4.55 million miles behind <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding toward the edge of the solar system at 37,568 mph. Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making the moon `` the coldest body we have seen in the solar system,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>. Scientists believe <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION> and its moon <PERSON> Charon </PERSON> are the second-coldest bodies in the solar system. Voyager also found smog on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in the planet's atmosphere converts it into a 90-mile-thick icy layer of photochemical smog at the bottom of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s stratosphere, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, an imaging team member from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Photochemical smog exists any place we've been that has an atmosphere,'' imaging team leader <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said of other planets and moons `` In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the problem is it's happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s smoggy moon. In another finding, the best close-up shot of the Neptunian moon 1989 N1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide surface. That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1, one of the six moons discovered by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> since June, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Voyager found earlier that 1989 N1 really is <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s second-largest moon after <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> Scientists previously thought Nereid was No. 2. Instruments aboard Voyager discovered <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> is encircled by electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape, called a torus. The torus is created by gases coming off of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Jupiter is orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur volcanoes on the <LOCATION> Jovian </LOCATION> moon Io. The space probe also found <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> have auroras vaguely like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights. They glow in ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye, however, unlike Earth's visible auroras. Voyager's close encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> last week capped its epic tour of the four outer planets, including <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. The probe was launched in 1977 along with its twin, <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, which explored only Jupiter and Saturn.

 A senior Iranian opposition figure has been arrested in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on a visa fraud charge, authorities said Monday. <PERSON> Aladdin </PERSON> <PERSON> Touran </PERSON>, a senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mojahedin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested Aug. 21 at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by agents of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other federal agencies, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Touran </PERSON>, a member of the Mojahedin's international relations department, was wanted for allegedly entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in August 1988 with a fraudulent visa at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The charge was contained in a complaint issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION>'s Office in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the Mojahedin condemned the arrest of a top leader the organization says is under a death sentence issued in absentia by the Iranian government. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jafarzadeh </PERSON> said the arrest was an effort by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to improve relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in its attempts to win release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The opposition group has engaged in combat with the Iranian regime, even taking up arms in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Touran </PERSON>, 33, was being held without bail Monday at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's spokeswoman <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON> scheduled an identification hearing for Touran for Sept. 6, Ms. <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Touran </PERSON> probably would be extradited to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to face the charge if he does n't enter a plea in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, she said. <PERSON> Touran </PERSON> was arrested as he stepped off a <ORGANIZATION> Scandinavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Touran </PERSON> was carrying Swedish travel documents issued in the name of <LOCATION> Noori-Elika </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Claes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jernaeus </PERSON>, press attache to the Swedish consulate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Touran </PERSON> used the name Noori-Elika for security purposes, fearing retribution from the Iranian regime, <PERSON> Jefarzadeh </PERSON> said. He also said <PERSON> Touran </PERSON>'s use of the other name when traveling was well-known by European and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Jefarzadeh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Touran </PERSON> had a Swedish politica refugee passport and lived in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Continues to be Top Importer of Oats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Foreign producers are seeing some of the bloom fade from the lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oats market as American farmers rebound from last year's drought, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been the world's largest importer of oats since 1983-84, including a spectacular increase the last two or three years as consumers discovered the grain's health benefits. `` Research has linked the fiber content of oats with lower serum cholesterol levels, and health concerns have buoyed the demand for oat food products,'' the report said. In the 1988-89 marketing year that ended May 31, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oats imports rose to about 68 million bushels, or nearly 1 million metric tons, a 50 percent increase from 1987-88. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 68.9 bushels of oats. A bushel of oats weights 32 pounds, little more than half that of wheat. Oats imports in 1989-90 are forecast to settle back to around 50 million bushels, or about 725,000 tons, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to remain as the dominant buyer in the world market, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that food use of oats in 1988-89 jumped more than 40 percent from the previous year, but that the amount of oats used as livestock feed has been declining because of its relative high price relative to corn. Oats production this year is expected to rise 74 percent from the drought-stricken 1988 harvest to 381 million bushels, or about 5.53 million tons, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts. `` This likely will mean season average farm prices 25 percent to 40 percent below last year,'' the report said. `` Imports are expected to drop 25 percent ... -LRB- but -RRB- at this level, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports would still account for about half the volume of world trade forecast to 1989-90.'' The report, published in the September issue of Agricultural Outlook, said `` no significant increases'' in oats imports by other countries are expected. `` While interest in the health qualities of oats may be growing in other countries, this has not yet translated into significantly higher import demand for food-quality oats,'' the report said. Economist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said in his report that global export supplies of oats in 1989-90 `` are expected to be adequate to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand'' and that even if market prices drop significantly the major suppliers `` are likely to continue producing for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' market. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> have been the biggest suppliers since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oats boom began, but <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> also are providers. Some oats were bought from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last year, after <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> turned out a poor harvest. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said that even if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production turns out as forecast, the proportion of top quality oats is not assured and that `` a shortage of high-quality oats suitable for milling count still push imports higher than currently expected.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says oats prices nationally may average in the range of $ 1.55 to $ 1.95 per bushel in 1989-90, compared with $ 2.61 estimated for 1988-89.

 Have plenty of calling cards, do n't be pushy, and be sure to handle liquor well. That's part of the secret of doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, says a trade consultant. <PERSON> Song-Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jang </PERSON>, president of S.H. <PERSON> Jang </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said it pays for an American exporter to learn about his country's culture, national priorities and business customs. `` The exchange of calling cards is very important,'' he writes in the current issue of AgExporter magazine published by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, every person has a distinct place in the organizational hierarchy. Consequently, Korean business people want to know right away what position you hold in your company.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, with its 40 million people, is a prime buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products, ranking No. 2 last year with purchases totaling $ 2.3 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the No. 1 single-country buyer at $ 7.3 billion. `` Do n't try to push your position too hard,'' he said. `` Sensitive issues and details may be skipped for future discussions, either by a go-between or by your staff, if available.'' The use of go-betweens can be valuable in `` delicate dealings'' involving money, <PERSON> Jang </PERSON> said. `` Never cause Koreans to lose face by putting them in a difficult position,'' he said. `` On the contrary, find something to praise, such as their country's recently earned prosperity.'' <PERSON> Jang </PERSON> said entertainment is an important part of trade relationships and, when offered, should always be accepted. In due time, it should be reciprocated in some way. `` Korean parties are often like drinking competitions,'' he said. `` A capacity for alcohol consumption may be one of the deciding factors in a successful business negotiation and relationship. The giving of small gifts is also an accepted practice and is recommended.''

 A Mexican cult member who is accused of gory human sacrifices is suffering from AIDS, a defense attorney and the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 23, has acquired immune deficiency syndrome, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Judicial officials confirmed <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> had been tranferred to a prison hospital but refused to disclose his illness. `` He has AIDS,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyar </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` That's what the doctors told me.'' <PERSON> Moyar </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON> represents the woman prosecutors say was the cult's `` godmother'' _ <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON>. The lawyer said doctors' reports show Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, 24, does not have the fatal disease though she and <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> both were lovers of cult leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, who died in a May 6 shootout with police in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Several other cult members also were lovers of the 26-year-old <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, according to court testimony. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a usually fatal disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. Cult members had been on the run since the April discovery of 15 mutilated bodies on a ranch near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, across the border from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Among the victims was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student who cult members say was sacrificed in a ritual to provide protection for their drug-smuggling business. <PERSON> Orea </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> claim to know nothing about the killings.

 Officials of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities say they need `` real commitments'' from the federal government to deal with problems affecting children, including child care, drugs and teen-age pregnancy. `` We need help, and we need it now,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and a member of the National League of Cities. `` We also need real commitments over the long run, not the kind of federal aid that is here one year and gone the next.'' The League released a 390-city survey Monday that found officials in nine of 10 cities regard child care as the most pressing need among children's issues. `` This report is a sobering slap of reality that should awaken our national conscience,'' said <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, chairman of the League's human development policy committee In cities between 50,000 and 100,000 population, alcohol and drugs were rated as the second most pressing issue, named by 48 percent of those questioned. Education, especially dropout prevention, and health were second among cities between 100,000 and 300,000 population, with 41 percent of those responding mentioning each. In larger cities, however, the prevention of teen-age pregnancy became the second most serious problem, cited by 43 percent. Nearly half of the cities under 300,000 and 70 percent of the larger cities said lack of money was the chief barrier to dealing with such problems. Some cities, the report said, already are taking steps to deal with the problems: _ <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Barnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, developed a program to train mothers on welfare to operate family day-care homes _ In <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pregnancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has sponsored an annual conference for teens on sexuality and is working on a community action plan _ <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, funds 10 apartments and places homeless families with children in them for up to two months rent-free _ In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, an advisory council of children and adults advises the City Council on young people's issues `` From coast to coast, cities are working on these issues in innovative ways,'' the report said. `` They predict their involvement will increase over time _ except there is no money to support expansion.'' One city out of four is significantly involved in child care and, the report said, that is expected to increase to one in three during the 1990s. The study covered 278 cities with populations above 50,000, and 112 smaller cities. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said the survey of larger cities, covering 60 percent of all those in the nation, was much broader than that for the smaller communities. `` Most of the findings run parallel for the smaller cities and can be regarded as generally good indicators,'' he said.

 Unlike other aging rockers who have gone back on the road, the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airplane </LOCATION> is n't doing it for the money, lead singer <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Slick </PERSON> says. `` The Who and the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> figure, ` I want another wing on my villa,' so they go and tour,'' <PERSON> Slick </PERSON> said. `` We go on the road because the guys just like to play.''

The group plans to release its first album in 17 years next week. Slick said she enjoyed the 1960s drug scene, but she said she is thankful to the police for helping her get off drugs and alcohol. `` The highway patrol finally said, ` Look, if you do n't stop driving 150 miles an hour we're going to take your license away,''' she said, adding that she took their advice because she is `` probably still more addicted to cars than drugs.'' `` I never thought in my wildest dreams when I was a kid that I'd thank the highway patrol for being alive,'' she said

 What do <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann-Margaret </PERSON> have in common? They're both on the cover of the latest issue of TV Guide, and neither is pleased. Appearing under the headline `` Oprah! The Richest Woman on TV?'' the magazine's cover illustration has the talk-show host's face superimposed on the actress' hourglass figure. The cover, which appears to show Miss <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> in a gauzy dress atop a pile of money, is not identified as a composite. TV Guide acknowledged Monday that unsuspecting readers might think it's a real photograph. The lean body came from a publicity shot of Ann-Margret for a `` Rockette'' special she did about 10 years ago, according to her publicist, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirvay </PERSON>. `` I think she was shocked,'' <PERSON> Kirvay </PERSON> said. `` If you look at the two pictures, they're identical. It's even her ring on <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON>'s hand.'' The formerly overweight Miss <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, who lost 67 pounds on a diet in 1988, had no part in the cover's making, said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardio </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Miss <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>'s Harpo production company. `` Oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that nor would she pose in that revealing a dress,'' she said. `` Ann-Margret should be thrilled because she's got another TV Guide cover,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON>, the magazine's national section editor. `` And <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> should be thrilled because she looks terrific.'' But <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON> said TV Guide had instructed the artist who did the illustration `` not to use photographs so literally'' in the future.

<HEAD>Robbers Steal More Than Ton of Silver From Remote Nevada Mine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two shotgun-toting robbers stole more than a ton of unprocessed silver from a remote mine in a caper so well planned that authorities suspect they had inside information. Baffled authorities said Monday they had no solid leads or suspects in the robbery late Saturday night at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION>, in <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON> about 90 miles northeast of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. The impure silver was worth more than $ 200,000, authorities said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokesman for Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns part of the mine, said the robbers carted off the loot using a wheelbarrow and truck and then left spikes in the road to flatten tires of any pursuers. `` It was well planned, that's for sure,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` They knew what they were doing.'' A man wearing a red ski mask and armed with a .12 - gauge shotgun confronted two mine employees, tied them with duct tape and then loaded up 1.25 tons of silver buttons, wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow, onto a pickup truck outside, <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Undersheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> The robber was about 6-foot-4 and his accomplice was either a small man or a woman, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The robbery was discovered when the next mining shift came in Sunday morning, police said. The bound employees were n't injured. Authorities speculated the robbers would try to melt down the unmarked silver buttons, which are the size of Hershey kisses. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said police have notified precious metals dealers about the theft. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the tires of mining company employees' cars were flattened by spikes in the road when they drove to <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON> to report the theft Sunday morning. It took the robbers more than one hour to load up the booty that was in a locked vault and was scheduled to be shipped out of <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON> soon, according to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who said the thieves apparently broke the lock. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the mine normally waits until it has about 50,000 ounces of dore, or unpure silver, before it ships a load for further processing. The robbers got away with 40,000 ounces.

<HEAD>US Trade Deficit Cut With Industrialized Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut its trade deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and industrialized countries of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the first half of 1989, but increased its deficit with Third World countries. That's the kind of development many economists have been urging, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> buys too much from advanced industrial countries and sells them too little. Poorer nations want to expand their sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and cut imports. If the second half of the year is like the first, the deficit with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> will be only $ 4.5 billion, compared with $ 15.8 billion last year, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released Monday. No breakdown was given for individual European countries. With the four industrialized areas of the Far East known as the `` four tigers'' _ <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> _ the decrease in the deficit would be $ 6.5 billion, to $ 22.7 billion. Those countries have allowed the value of their currencies to rise, making their goods less attractive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and encouraging exports. The projected drop in the deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, however, is only $ 1.8 billion, leaving its deficit at $ 50.9 billion. Some economists think the trend wo n't continue. `` This is the end of the good news in trade,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting company. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of DRI-McGraw <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said the growth of exports had slowed with the rise of the price of the dollar over the past 18 months. The increased cost of the dollar in terms of yen and marks, for example, should make American goods less attractive to Japanese and West Germans. The changes in the projected balance are due to exports, increasing at a rate of 15 percent to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 14 percent to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 7 percent to the four tigers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficits were increasing at a rate of $ 7 billion with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries, $ 1 billion with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and $ 200 million with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of farm goods were growing more rapidly _ 13 percent _ than minerals and manufactured products _ 12 percent. There was a 24 percent surge in imports of petroleum, which is coming in at the fastest rate since 1985 and at higher prices. Other kinds of imports increased more slowly, though Mexican sales showed a strong increase of 14 percent to a rate of $ 2.9 billion. From <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the increased rate was only 4 percent, and 6 percent from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. In the second quarter, March through June, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports were almost unchanged from the first quarter. Drops in sales of wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, soybeans to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and tobacco to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were offset by increased sales of feed grains to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Other kinds of exports increased by 4 percent, led by chemicals and aircraft to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Imports of passenger cars dropped sharply in the quarter _ 37 percent from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and 9 percent from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers increased production in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which sent 31 percent more vehicles across the border.

In seeking the exemption, <PERSON> Avanti </PERSON> said convertibles comprise two-thirds of its sales and noted that the small company is very important to <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a once-thriving steel center suffering through a long period of high unemployment.

The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. A quake of 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Senate Seeks Closure of U.S. Bases, Challenges Mrs. Aquino</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> calls to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in two years have increased pressure on President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and set the stage for difficult talks with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the future of the strategically important installations. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to say whether she favors keeping the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, which employ more than 70,000 Filipinos. But opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, one of the co-sponsors of a resolution seeking the base closures, said the proposal is aimed at forcing her to take a stand. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino officials are to begin talks later this year on a new treaty to replace the Military Bases Agreement, which expires in September 1991. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is expected to discuss the issue when she visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November. `` That <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution looks like the genie out of the bottle,'' wrote former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> in the Philippine Daily Star. `` And it will take a lot of political genius on the part of the Aquino administration to put the genie back in the bottle.'' Twelve senators sponsored the resolution last Thursday. Under the constitution, any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, so the resolution shows the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration lacks the votes for ratification. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials claim the installations, including <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Subic Bay naval base, are essential for maintaining the military balance in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and protecting sea lanes to pro-Western nations such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, military dependents and civilian employees are stationed at the bases, among the oldest and largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> garrisons abroad. Assuming Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> supports an extension, she has a number of options for pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into ratification. Most political surveys indicate a majority of Filipinos support the bases, which pay more than $ 96 million in local salaries annually. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s view reflects that of the nationalistic urban classes, which see the bases as a vestige of colonialism. Political analysts say Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could call for a referendum on the bases and then pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into accepting the national will. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could also use a discrepancy between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino interpretation of the expiration date. The constitution says the agreement expires in 1991. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the agreement actually says that after Sept. 16, 1991, either side can terminate with one-year's notice. Without notification, the agreement runs indefinitely, they say. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> prefers to sidestep the ambiguity, saying he would like a new agreement negotiated and ratified before the 1991 cutoff. Faced with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejection, the Aquino administration could delay the ratification vote until after a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is elected in May 1992, four months before the end of the notification period. In any event, most analysts see long and difficult negotiations before any new agreement can be forged. This is due in part to a wide gap between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino views of the bases. To <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the bases are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s contribution to the defense of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a commitment that transcends dollars and cents. Because the bases are here, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would defend the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with American blood. As an island people hundreds of miles removed from the Asian mainland, Filipinos do not perceive an external threat. To them, the threat is internal _ Communist and Moslem insurgents.

Last October, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed to pay $ 461 million a year to keep the bases until 1991. `` I told them that if they are waiting for foreign aid to more than double, they have a long wait coming,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., who visited the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> this month `` Either a base is necessary for mutual defense or it is not.''

<HEAD>1970s Underground Abortion Group Prepares to Pass the Torch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The threat of court and legislative action to restrict or outlaw abortion is leading some women to consider reviving an old underground movement that performed clandestine abortions. The group _ called <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> after a pseudonym some of the women used at the time _ performed as many as 13,000 abortions in the four years before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> legalized the procedure in 1973, said former organizer <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The high court's decision July 3 allowing states to place restrictions on abortions and the threat of further court restrictions may make it necessary to revive the group, said Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Surgal </PERSON>, another key <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> member. `` It's time for new people to move in, a new generation,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, 48, now a freelance writer. `` I will do everything in my power to teach them everything I know, but I would hope it would n't be necessary. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, believed to have been the only group of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, involved about 120 Chicago-area women who were trained, in some cases by sympathetic doctors, to perform abortions. They worked clandestinely from 1969 to 1972 under constant threat of arrest. `` Already -LRB- courts -RRB- are making it harder. The laws may make it illegal, but women are going to keep it available. I'm convinced,'' Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. At a recent pro-choice march in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, she said, a number of women from various states said they would establish similar underground groups and take the movement nationwide if abortion were outlawed again. `` It's easier if you have a role model somehow because it gives people courage,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Surgal </PERSON>, 51. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholberg </PERSON>, assistant director of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said his group would battle any attempt to revive an underground abortion network. `` We'll see to it that they're prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' he said. `` We'll have spies, we'll have to have people claiming to be seeking out abortions ... to find out who the illegal abortionists are so they can be punished.'' In addition, he challenged the ability of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> members to perform abortions safely. `` I seriously doubt their safety record,'' he said. `` No abortion is safe because it always kills the baby.'' Women who were active in the group said 3 percent of treated women developed complications, usually infections, but that no women died. Statistics from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based research branch of Planned Parenthood, placed the complication rate for abortions performed by doctors at about 1 percent. Seven <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> members were arrested in 1972 despite frequent changes in locations where the abortions were performed. The charges were dropped after the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling that legalized abortion. Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said she would risk going to jail to give women the freedom to choose abortion. `` What's more important, my staying out of jail or a woman having to have an abortion?'' she said.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law enforcement agents have increased security around Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> because of fears of a backlash from Colombian drug lords under pressure. `` There has been a general warning, a general concern of high-profile public officials on the subject of drugs,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Monday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> just feels a little bit more comfortable, at least in these next few days, being a little more cautious.''

Mrs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> called the 911 emergency line, but a deputy told her there was nothing police could do until the husband arrived at the house, according to a transcript of the conversation. `` You have to make a judgment call over whether a threat is emergent or immediate.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> says he plans to contact the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels to obtain their cooperation with a peace plan calling for their disarmament. Five Central American nations have asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to monitor the voluntary disbanding of up to 11,000 Contras camped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and the repatriation of as many as 12,000 of their dependents. `` They are asking us to monitor operations to disarm the opposition, and that is something that is very complicated and is not very much in our practice,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said after briefing the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` That is why I need assurances that if we send people there, there is cooperation from the resistance forces,'' he said. The presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> signed an accord Aug. 7 calling for the disbanding of the Contras 90 days after a joint resettlement mission of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> representatives is formed. `` We'll be in contact with the resistance, to find ways and means to be in touch with them in order to have assurances from them that they will accept disarming, to give their arms to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said. These contacts will take place `` as soon as possible,'' he added. The secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Friday they will launch the mission Sept. 6. By having the `` <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'' begin its work on that date, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chiefs set Dec. 5 as the target date for the voluntary repatriation. Numerous Contra field commanders and guerrillas have vowed they will not give up their fight. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomat active in Central American affairs, however, said preliminary talks with the Contras indicate they are quite willing to go home or be resettled, and said little resistance is expected. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had lobbied the Central American nations to allow the Contras to stay in their camps through the Feb. 25 national elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, to maintain pressure on the leftist Sandinista government to allow a fair campaign. Even <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, however, which has received lavish military and foreign aid from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, agreed earlier this month there was no justification to continue their mission. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives the Contras $ 4.5 million a month in non-lethal aid that may also be used for resettlement. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off funds for weapons last year, prompting the Contras to arrange a truce with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government last year. Since then they have launched only sporadic raids.

 Investigators looking into the nation's worst oil spill and parties to litigation arising from it have started inspecting the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, the supertanker that caused the disaster. <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said two of the agency's investigators arrived Monday at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> shipyard to begin their anticipated five-day inspection The Valdez is in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> dry dock for a nine-month repair job estimated to cost $ 25 million. The ship's hull was shredded, causing about 11 million gallons of crude to spill into Alaskan waters, when it struck a reef March 24 in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the inspection is the first look at the tanker's hull outside of the water since the grounding The inspectors findings will be included in the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report on the spill, which is expected to be finished early next year, she said. Others in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to examine the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> are an Alaskan state investigator and representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of seven oil companies that includes <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>. The state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is suing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the spill, which devastated hundreds of miles of pristine shoreline and killed scores of waterfowl and marine wildlife. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> also is a defendant in the case. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, an Exxon spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said the inspections are being conducted `` because the vessel itself is considered evidence and they want a first-hand look at it.'' He declined to elaborate because of the pending litigation. Shipyard workers will begin repairing the ship's damaged hull after the inspections are complete. `` We ca n't start work -LRB- until then -RRB- because of certain court orders that restrict any work that would cut or modify the ship,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASSCO </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of finance and public relations. `` Engineering, procurement and fabrication of steel outside the ship are continuing, so we are still proceeding with the job. We just ca n't proceed with the rip out of the damaged sections of the hull.'' The Valdez was towed from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, arriving off the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> coast July 10. It was kept from entering <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> for three weeks, however, because of oily slicks sighted near the ship when it reached <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Huge steel plates that were peeled downward from the hull during the 2,500-mile journey also had to be cut off by divers at sea so they would n't drag bottom in the bay. The tanker docked at a NASSCO pier July 30 after the environmental and navigational problems were fixed to the satisfaction of state and federal officials. The Valdez floated into a dock for the repair work Aug. 15. Pumping operations to remove water trapped inside the enclosed repair dock were completed Friday. The water was transferred to another <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> ship, which will take it to a processing facility at an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. During the weekend, shipyard workers washed down the dock to remove sand, silt and marine growth. The debris was put into barrels and trucked to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> hazardous waste dump for disposal. `` The dock is now dry and clean so the appropriate individuals can inspect the ship,'' <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON> said.

 No more sniffing and prodding to tell if a melon is ripe _ government scientists have introduced a fail-safe method: the melon meter. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> researchers have developed an infrared device that measures the sugar content of watermelons, cantaloupes and honeydews. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dull </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> chemist in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, said 16 years of research yielded the melon meter, which shines infrared light into the top of the fruit and then measures the amount of light that comes out the side. The computerized device determines the amount of soluable solids, based on how much light the fruit absorbs. Soluble solids are predominantly sugars. `` The No. 1 parameter of quality is sweetness,'' <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said in an interview. `` If you have n't got sweetness, you have n't got a good melon.'' Growers and consumers currently have to rely on appearance in judging ripeness and quality, <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said, but similar-looking melons can vary from 5 percent to 10 percent in sweetness. `` There's no one who can look at the outside and tell you whether that melon is good,'' he said. Several companies have expressed an interesting in producing melon meters, <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said, and they probably will be installed initially in packing sheds, where the fruit is graded, packed and shipped. He believes they will appeal to suppliers who want to provide consumers with the highest quality melons. `` I think we're just opening the door'' on analyzing fresh produce, he said. `` With computers and high-speed equipment, we might be able to get down to -LRB- measuring -RRB- the vitamins.''

<HEAD>Ex-Interior Minister Faces 20-Year Maximum Penalty in Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former interior minister of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison in a drug and corruption scandal, the official Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> reported. Divison Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> also faces demotion from general to private, the news agency said in a dispatch monitored Monday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The dispatch did not say when a verdict was expected. <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> was tried on charges of abusing power, neglecting his duties and enriching himself by stealing from the government, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. Prosecutors requested the stiff sentence Sunday at the end of four days of testimony before a military tribunal. The trial is the latest chapter in a drug trafficking scandal that has shaken the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island, disrupted the nation's reputation for communist discipline, and sent four officers to the firing squad One of them was a highly decorated war hero. The tribunal also was asked for sentences ranging from eight to 15 years in prison for six other ministry officials, including the former vice interior minister and the former head of customs, the news agency said. The defendants are accused of using their government posts for private gain; the prosecution asked the tribunal to confiscate the profits. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> as interior minister in June, when 12 military officers from the ministry and two from the army were charged with drug smuggling and other crimes. Four were executed and the others are serving up to 30 years in prison. The prosecution said <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> fumbled the drug-trafficking investigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate, but it said the evidence did not support a charge of treason, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> knew as early as February that officials of his ministry were involved in drug trafficking but did nothing about it, the prosecution charged. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had personally ordered Abrantes to conduct the investigation after persistent reports that tons of Colombian cocaine and Jamaican marijuana were moving through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The prosecution asked the tribunal to sentence the former vice interior minister, Division Gen. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, to 15 years and demote him to private for abuse of power and stealing from the government. It requested a 13-year sentence for bribery and abuse of power for Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, former head of customs, and said he should be demoted to the rank of foot soldier. <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> and four others are accused of taking money from some of the officers arrested in June. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> allegedly accumulated millions of dollars in an illegal fund set up at the ministry. The chief prosecutor, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, said he was so consumed with `` dollar fever'' that he traded Cuban pesos on the black market for his own profit. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who has for years denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of Cuban complicity in the drug trade, said the officers involved in narcotics were traitors to his cause.

<TEXT>
 Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> said the agreement banning <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> from baseball leaves <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> free to express his opinion that the former <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager bet on baseball. But <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said he felt double-crossed by <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s remarks, made during the news conference last Thursday at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in which the commissioner announced <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lifetime banishment. `` Just 12 hours earlier, we signed that agreement in good faith, and there he was saying he thinks I bet on baseball,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Monday. `` The only reason I signed that agreement was that it had no finding that I bet on baseball. We got what we wanted, and we did n't have to go another eight months and spend another three-quarters of a million dollars,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said On Monday, <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> appeared to misunderstand the agreement. `` I was very clear about the fact that I was not going to be constrained from saying what I thought was the case,'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` I'm not going to change anything I said.'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>, asked at the news conference whether he thought <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> had bet on baseball, replied, `` Based on the evidence and in the absence of a hearing, I have concluded that, yes, he bet on baseball.'' Deputy commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, drafted the agreement, which includes a stipulation that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> neither admits nor denies betting on baseball. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> had told him what <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s reponse would be to a question about whether <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on baseball `` That's true, he did,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. `` Maybe I misunderstood. Maybe I was n't altogether clear on what Mr. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> would say. I think that I was surprised that -LRB- <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s statement -RRB- was that strong, that he put it that way and that it came so fast.'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> said he based his opinion on the 225-page report by baseball investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>. The agreement noted that baseball rules allow <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> to apply for reinstatement after a year but do n't guarantee that he can return <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said he's considering a television appearance to tell his side of the story. `` We've got some good minds working on it,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` The key thing is, we'll tell the story and let the people decide. But I do n't know how I'm going to do it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> are reportedly investigating whether <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> illegally concealed winnings from gambling or sales of memorabilia. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has dropped an earlier reported investigation of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Helmsley Bodyguard Found at Jury's Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s bodyguards was found in the hotel where the jurors in her tax evasion trial were sequestered and rode the elevator with one juror, according to a report today. But there was `` an innocent explanation and both the government and court are satisfied,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The 12-member jury in <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s tax evasion and extortion trial was heading into a fourth day of deliberations today. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, is charged with evading $ 1.2 million in federal taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations at her <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> mansion, to her businesses. <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> and defense attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> would not say why the unnamed bodyguard was in the hotel Friday night. In court papers, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> to `` convey to his client to tell her people to stay out of the hotel.'' `` Needless to say, this is not a Helmsley hotel,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> are among the biggest owners of hotels and other real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The judge said a federal marshal was escorting a juror back to her hotel room after dinner Friday when one of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s security guards got on the same elevator The marshal purposely pushed the elevator button for the wrong floor so the guard would not know which floor the juror was staying on, according to the judge in the transcript. The juror, misunderstanding the situation, pushed the correct button. However, the juror and the guard got off the elevator on different floors. `` If the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> security people think they are doing their client a favor by investigating where the jurors are, the rooms the jurors are staying in or what floor the jurors are staying in or a particular hotel, they are not,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. Two Helmsley guards appeared before the judge, but the transcript of the hearing, including the identity of the guard in question, was sealed.

<HEAD>Youths Battle Police at Carnival; 37 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty officers and seven civilians were injured when rowdy youths ended an otherwise peaceful Afro-Caribbean carnival by pelting police with cans and bottles, authorities said today. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said 37 were injured and 250 arrested during the two-day carnival in the <LOCATION> Notting </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> district that ended Monday night after drawing about 500,000 people. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambulance </PERSON>, however, said it treated 269 people _ 21 of them policemen _ during the festival. Fifty people were hospitalized, although there was `` nothing of a serious nature,'' a spokesman said. One officer was stabbed but was not seriously hurt, said the Yard, headquarters of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police. The Yard said charges against those arrested included possession of weapons and drugs, and disorderly behavior. It blamed groups of youths `` determined to provoke disorder'' for violence in the carnival's closing hours when police were struck by tossed cans and bottles. Police with riot shields tackled the rampaging youths. The Yard said about 5,000 officers were on the streets, some on horseback, and a police helicopter was overhead as the violence flared. The clashes took place at the close of what was earlier called the most peaceful of the Afro-Caribbean festivals that have been held for 24 years during the late August three-day bank holiday weekend. Deputy assistant police commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideout </PERSON> said the day had been `` most successful'' until the clashes. Police estimated 200,000 people on Sunday and 300,000 on Monday jammed the streets to see the spectacularly dressed paraders, street performers and bands in what has become a cultural focal point for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s black community. Riots, muggings and other violence marred previous festivals and a man was fatally stabbed in 1987. Conservative lawmaker <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said the carnival should be banned because of the cost of policing it, which he estimated at $ 1.56 million this year. `` There were probably more police on the streets monitoring the carnival than there were throughout the rest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It is outrageous that we should have to pay for this,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pensions board say they may not be able to comply with church's insistence on rapid divestment from companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Whether the law will permit us to follow this churchwide directive, I ca n't answer,'' said investment specialist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, president of the board. The denomination's legislative assembly on Monday voted that by September 1991 the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pensions </ORGANIZATION> be completely rid of stocks in companies with `` direct or indirect'' business dealings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. An estimated 80 to 85 percent of the 1,041 delegates voted for the deadline in a show-of-cards vote. At stake was the church's $ 1.6 billion pension fund, of which $ 84.9 million is invested in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, chair of the board, pointed out the board was incorporated separately from the church and thus was not legally bound by its instructions, although sharing its purposes and principles. `` The board has a right not to accept it if we feel it is violating our fiduciary responsibility,'' Ms. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` But we take that mandate seriously in regard to investments.'' The vote by delegates of the newly merged 5.3 million-member denomination is intended to put pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its apartheid system of race separation. `` It puts teeth into our concern,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellwanger </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> said of the deadline. He said if the church ca n't `` hear the voices of blacks crying for justice above the call of profit yield, then it does n't mean anything to be called the body of Christ.' Before the vote, <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said a deadline threatened financial responsibility. `` It puts us in an almost impossible situation to act in a prudent way,'' <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said. To `` introduce controls'' over investing of funds, he said, `` jeopardizes them and increases risk.'' Ms. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said the time limit imposed for the divestment process was `` too short. We would have great difficulty accomplishing that goal. We do recognize the frustration of the church about it.'' Forty-four of the 65 regional synods had demanded total divestment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as had predecessor denominations of the merged body, but none had fixed a deadline for it. The assembly, entering the next to last day of an eight-day meeting, also approved a major, long-range program, called Mission 90, to strengthen Bible teaching, evangelism and work for the cause of peace and justice. The meeting is the first since the 1988 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>.

 American and Thai troops today assaulted a beach along the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to climax six weeks of war games codenamed `` Thalay Thai 89.''

A news release said 4,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines and naval personnel from both countries joined in the exercise, which also included maneuvers on land after the landing. The Aug. 9 to Sept. 19 exercise is designed to strengthen combat effectiveness and cooperation between the two countries, which have close, longstanding ties.

 At a funeral for slain Black Panther co-founder <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, friends called his death a `` clarion call'' to free black communities of drug-related violence and mourners chanted `` Free <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>,'' a reminder of an earlier period of militancy. `` His problem with chemical dependency represents all our weaknesses in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s friend and fellow Panther <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> during the service Monday. Among the 1,200 people attending the service at the <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> were <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rap </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Panther co-founder <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>. Hundreds of others milled around in the streets outside. Many in the congregation gave raised-fist salutes when <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, 52, donned a black beret and said `` all power to the people'' during his turn at the pulpit. The mourners left the church chanting `` Free <PERSON> Huey </PERSON>,'' the refrain that sounded during <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s frequent imprisonments beginning in the 1960s. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, 47, was killed early Aug. 22 in the poor <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years ago. Police said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> died in a dispute over crack cocaine. While <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s violent death should be used as a `` clarion call'' to solve national problems with drugs and alcohol, many of the mourners remembered <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> as a hero of the bold and belligerent black pride movement. Members of <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s family, friends and fellow radicals recalled the days when the Black Panthers espoused the cause of black liberation and `` the power of the gun'' against white authority. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spain </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Panther </PERSON> who recently won a new trial in the 1971 killings of two prison guards, spoke at the funeral about problems still facing blacks. `` After the dust clears and next week, little kids say ` <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> who?' remember that in someone's community ... a human being was gunned down and that should serve as a notice that there's a lot of work to do,'' said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 40, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> while serving time at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> in 1966. As the party's minister of defense and chief ideologue, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> became one of the most articulate leaders of the black militancy movement. The Panthers embraced Maoist political theory and espoused the use of arms for defense against police, whom they called racist. A Black Panther poster distributed nationally during the orgnization's heyday pictured <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> sitting on an African wicker throne, a spear in one hand, a shotgun in the other Many of <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s admirers discounted police accounts and blamed his death on authorities with whom <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> battled for decades. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> had a long criminal history including a manslaughter conviction in the 1967 shooting death of a police officer. He was freed after 22 months when an appellate court sent the case back to trial court. While in prison in March on a narcotics paraphernalia possession charge, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> received a suspended two-year sentence in connection with the theft of $ 15,000 in state funds from community schools operated by the Panthers. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, who is accused of shooting <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, appeared in court briefly Monday and was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> to return Sept. 5 to enter a plea. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> allegedly shot <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> with a companion's gun after pistol-whipping the former Panther leader with his own gun, which jammed, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Being struck with the gun `` would explain the trauma to the right side of <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s face,'' the report said, quoting from a detailed log of the investigation kept by <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homicide </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>. `` Then <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> wrestled the witness' gun away from him because <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s gun jammed,'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. `` And <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> fired three times, striking <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Expect 28- to 32-Cent Stamp in 1991, Postmaster General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First-class letters will probably cost 28 to 32 cents to mail in three years and could include an 11-digit zip code by the turn of the century, says the postmaster general. Increased automation and other economies at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will most likely keep price increases for mailing a letter below inflation after 1991, Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said Monday. Speaking at the opening of a three-day convention of major Northeastern large-volume mailers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the actual increase for a first-class stamp by 1991 might be 5 cents, to a total of 30 cents. `` I'll point out that 5 cents is a 20 percent increase in three years, which is more or less the amount that the costs have gone up over the last three years,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. The cost of mailing a first-class letter rose from 22 cents to 25 cents in the spring of 1988. An increase in 1991 would continue the recent policy of increases every three years. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that after running a surplus last fiscal year, the postal service will be hard pressed to break even in the current year and faces the greatest deficit in its existence, up to $ 1.7 billion, in fiscal 1990. Automation will cost the postal service $ 4 billion between now and 1995 but will save having to hire 100,000 workers, he said. New machines exist that can scan nine miles of mail an hour and can spot a bar code anywhere on the face of an envelope, even one sandwiched into a cluttered address block or placed amid graphics and colorful designs. Scanners now in use at post offices can pick up a bar code only on the lower right hand side of an envelope, isolated from the address block and other print. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the postal service wants to have nine-digit bar coding on all mail by 1995 and will begin testing an 11-digit code. With the current nine-digit code, the so-called ZIP plus 4, a piece of mail is automatically sorted to one or another side of a specific street in a given locale. The 11-digit code would sort a letter down to the building address, in effect stacking the mail in delivery sequence for a carrier at the destination. Businesses that code their own mail would get substantial postage discounts, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>After Slayings, Gov't Seeks Restraint on Videos Harmful to Youth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government, in the aftermath of four child slayings blamed on the harmful effects of horror videos, said today that it wants the video industry to regulate how its sells and rents violent tapes. The spread of videos in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been remarkable in recent years, and some `` feature brutality in the treatment of humans and animals and are seen clearly as inhumane,'' <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON>, director-general of the Management and <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON>, who also heads the agency's youth affairs administration, which works to prevent juvenile delinquency, said he is concerned about how such videos affect young people. <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON> urged the video industry strengthen its own regulations on the sale and rental of videos depicting cruelty. He also urged local governments and youth organizations to study ways of regulating the sale of potentially harmful videos. The request came after authorities said <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, a 26-year-old print shop worker, confessed to police investigators that he kidnapped and killed four girls, aged 4 to 7, over the past year in a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> suburb. News coverage of the case has focused repeatedly on his room, filled with a collection of some 5,000 videotapes, including horror films and animation films showing violence and undressed girls. Investigators said one of the killings to which <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON> has confessed followed the plot of one of his videotapes, `` Chiniku no Hana'' -LRB- Flower of Blood and Flesh -RRB-, in which a man follows a girl in his car, kidnaps her and then dismembers her in his apartment. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the government would ask the video industry to designate videos with violent scenes as `` adults only,'' as is done with pornographic videos in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>State Says It Will Fight Deportation Of Girl From Bangladesh</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state will fight the deportation of a 9-year-old Bangladeshi girl who was molested by the man who brought her to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. More than 200 people marched to the state capitol on Monday to express their opposition to deporting the youngster, known as <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON>, and afterwards they were rewarded. State officials said they would try to obtain an education visa for the girl, allowing her to stay indefinitely. The girl was taken by state workers from a foster home last week because it was n't `` culturally relevant.'' The girl's foster parents were among the marchers who demanded help for the youngster. The state <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said it would review the case and fight deportation. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopman </PERSON> said an education visa would be sought from the federal Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. She faces deportation when her visa expires Sept. 5. The girl is one of several members of a Bangladeshi family that <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, 52, brought to this country. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> consultant, he had married one of the girl's older sisters, separated from her and married another sister, age 12. Over the years he brought family members to work on his <LOCATION> Oakville </LOCATION> farm. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> is in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to taking indecent liberties with the girl and two other children. Sheriff's department officials said he subjected them to `` physical and psychological torture.'' At the rally, the foster parents _ chemical engineer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and his wife, English teacher <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON> _ wept when they were surrounded by supporters. They had feared the state would allow <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON> to be sent back to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> where she would be outcast because of the sexual abuse. `` <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON> has a magic that touches everyone,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> told the rally. `` She certainly has touched us. She was taken away from not only us but from the whole community. `` <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> and I did everything we could within the system but it was n't enough. Removing <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON> was wrong, just wrong,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> CPS </ORGANIZATION> workers took <PERSON> Khurshida </PERSON> `` Kushi'' Begum from the <LOCATION> Martin-Seidel </LOCATION> home at <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION> last Friday, declaring it was n't `` culturally relevant.'' <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON> has been placed at least temporarily with her 19-year-old sister here, whose marriage gave the youngster entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Supporters say if she is returned to her remote village she faces life as a social outcast because of her sexual abuse. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON>, who have been her foster parents for a year, had hoped to adopt the girl. But they have been told they can not keep her because they are not Moslem and because the natural parents will not give her up for adoption. `` The girl's birth parents want her educated and raised in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but their sect does not believe in adoption and they have not relinquished their rights,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hopman </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure she is bonded to them after the year she has been with them, but this has to do with family reunification and with cultural relevancy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hopman </PERSON> said. If the placement with her sister <PERSON> Morshida </PERSON> does n't work out, three Moslem families have volunteered their homes, Ms. <PERSON> Hopman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON> and her sister did not attend the rally Monday, fearing it would mean deportation of both, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who sheltered the family during the initial investigation. Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morshida </PERSON> has major problems of her own to deal with and that the foster parents would be a better placement. <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, 21, who lives in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said in an interview that <PERSON> Kushi </PERSON>'s parents do n't mind if their daughter stays with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON>. `` They say it's O.K. They do n't know about this adoption. This country is very hard. My parents ca n't understand,'' he said. `` They said it's OK if she happy,'' he said.

 About 200 people smashed windows, looted stores and battled in the streets early today after a protest over the shooting death of a young black man by police. More than 30 people were arrested and at least one person was hospitalized, police said. About 100 state and local police officers in riot gear battled to regain control of the streets after about 40 buildings were damaged along about a one-mile stretch of a downtown street. Order was restored about 4 a.m., police said. The trouble began around 11 p.m. Monday. `` Things are out of hand,'' <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zatzariny </PERSON> said earlier. `` They're going crazy to retaliate for the shooting.'' The disturbance was preceded by a march on the police station by about 100 demonstrators who chanted `` We want justice.'' <PERSON> Zatzariny </PERSON> said that crowd dispersed, but a few hours later separate groups of blacks and Hispanics began forming in various parts of the city and converged on <LOCATION> Landis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main drag of the mostly white downtown section of <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION>, a city of about 54,000 about 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The group, estimated by <PERSON> Zatzariny </PERSON> at 200, began throwing rocks and bottles at cars and storefront windows. `` There was extensive damage to stores,'' the lieutenant said. `` Windows were knocked out of a few police cars and a lot of civilian cars were smashed up pretty good.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasell </PERSON>, a manager of a <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Eleven </ORGANIZATION> convenience store on <LOCATION> Landis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, said he barely escaped injury. `` I was looking through the window and all of a sudden bricks came flying through,'' <PERSON> Vasell </PERSON> said. `` I started to run out the door and then more bricks came flying through so I just backed up and called the cops. I thought maybe somebody was going to start firing shots. I thought I was going to die.'' Smaller groups took to sidestreets and caused more damage, <PERSON> Zatzariny </PERSON> said. Several residents in the area scuffled with vandals and some members of the packs fought with each other, he said. The victim of the shooting, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 26, was killed Sunday by a white police officer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> reportedly threatened <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> with a steel rod, police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. Officers spotted <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> on Sunday after receiving an anonymous call about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had pending arrest warrants on drug and weapon charges, he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> allegedly threw two rocks at <LOCATION> Letizia </LOCATION> when the officer told him he was under arrest, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. He then picked up the rod and started toward the officer, swinging, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. `` He threatened to kill the officer,'' <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said, `` The officer was in fear of his life.'' The results of an autopsy are still out. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday's march was prompted by a report in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> that quoted <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> as saying, `` It was a justifiable shooting.'' `` When the newspaper hit the street, all hell broke loose,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` We're trying to defuse a very volatile situation.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the city's young officers long have used excessive force and made racist remarks. <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION>'s police force, with about 100 officers, has only one black, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said.

 Radical students screaming anti-government slogans today threw firebombs at police and captured and beat three officers in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, news reports said. The three riot policemen were captured when 1,000 students battled police at <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. About 1,300 then stormed the campus, firing tear gas, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the three policemen were released and taken to a hospital, and about 10 students were arrested. No further details were available. Rallies demanding the overthrow of the government and the release of a student charged with illegally visiting Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were held at 17 schools in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and 10 in provincial cities, the state <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> television said. About 700 students in the capital fought riot police with clubs, rocks and firebombs, news reports said. In the southeastern port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, about 1,000 students wielding firebombs and rocks clashed with police firing tear gas at <ORGANIZATION> Donga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in a battle that lasted 90 minutes, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Overthrow -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' yelled 200 students hurling firebombs on rain-slick streets outside <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyunghee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Riot police in combat fatigues fired tear gas to drive students back inside the campus. `` Release Miss Im Su-kyong, flower of unification!'' students shouted. Ms. <PERSON> Im </PERSON> was jailed for an illegal trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to promote national unification. She returned to the South in a much-publicized border crossing at the Demilitarized Zone Aug. 15. Students at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sungkyunkwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> also demonstrated for her release today, battling riot police. About 9,000 riot police surrounded <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses today to search for Im Chong-suk, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, who has eluded police for two months. Police issued an arrest warrant for Im in connection with the trip to the North by Ms. Im. The two Ims are not related. Ms. Im is in the custody of the national security agency, charged with violation of national security laws for making an unauthorized trip to a hostile nation. Police say all those involved with her trip face punishment. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government maintains that talks on unification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> must be carried out through official channels, not by private citizens. Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority, claim the government is insincere in its efforts at dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radicals also demand the withdrawal of 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact, saying their presence hinders unification. The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and the capitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945 and the two nations, which fought a war in 1950-53, remain bitter enemies.

 Six people described as skinheads were arrested on charges of racial intimidation after an attack on a 15-year-old Hispanic girl, police said. The victim suffered cuts and bruises but was not hospitalized during the attack by several skinheads at a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> park Monday evening, Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said. Three men were arrested and accused of first-degree racial intimidation, a felony, and were being held Monday night in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> jail. Three minors also were charged in the case. A 16-year-old boy was accused of racial intimidation, and two 16-year-old girls were accused of third-degree assault.

<HEAD>Dispute Grows Between Rival Afghan Guerrillas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Clashes between the two largest groups of U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas have left 300 people dead, one of the groups and some independent sources said today. A rival guerrilla group disputed the claim. The battles reflect deteriorating relations among the Pakistan-based guerrillas, who have yet to capture an Afghan city since the Soviets withdrew their government-allied forces more than six months ago. <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, a fundamentalist Moslem group, said 300 guerrillas were killed in fighting in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with the rival <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> group. `` We do n't have an updated figure, but we know that 100 <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> mujahedeen -LRB- Islamic holy warriors -RRB- have died and 200 from Jamiat,'' said a Hezb spokesman identified only as <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON>, a more liberal Moslem party, called the claim baseless. It said only that its men were holding five Hezb prisoners, including an important commander. `` They were handed over by the local people because they are criminals,'' said Jamiat spokesman <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>. `` Something is going on; that's for sure,'' said <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> <PERSON> Majrooh </PERSON>, an independent Afghan observer in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Both sides are involved. It's difficult to believe either one.'' <PERSON> Fazle </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON>, another prominent Afghan exile, said his information indicated between 170 and 200 mujahedeen have died in the fighting. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the official broadcaster of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist leaders, has reported at least 556 mujahedeen killed in such clashes in seven provinces since Aug. 18. However, the radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, is heavily slanted against the mujahedeen. Deep-rooted antagonisms between the two leading guerrilla groups broke out July 9 in northern <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> province when Hezb guerrillas under commander <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> ambushed and reportedly executed 32 Jamiat men, including several Jamiat commanders. <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON> claims that local Afghans captured <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> earlier this month and turned him over to <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON>'s northern commander, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON>. Hezb claims <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> was captured by pro-government militamen, who then handed him over to <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> because <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> had made some kind of deal with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Since the <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> clash, the president of the mujahedeens' self-declared government, <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, has publicly called <ORGANIZATION> Hezb </ORGANIZATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, a `` killer. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> is from the small, moderate <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The growing dispute has rocked the rebels' government, which is composed of Hezb, <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON> and five other Pakistan-based anti-government groups. The mujahedeen, based mainly in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are fighting to topple the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and replace it with a Moslem regime. Hard-line parties, such as <ORGANIZATION> Hezb </ORGANIZATION> and Jamiat, favor fighting for a military victory. Moderate mujahedeen groups have left the door open for a negotiated settlement. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> seized power in a 1978 military coup, touching off the insurgency.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Reports Pirate Attack, Nearly 150 Believed Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 17-year-old Vietnamese reported that pirates raided a boat carrying her and about 150 other Vietnamese refugees, and she believes nearly all the boat people died in the attack two months ago, police said today. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjapong </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <LOCATION> Songkhla </LOCATION> marine police, said the teen-ager told him the refugees left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> June 15 in a boat headed for <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. He said the teen-ager, whom he identified as <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuc </PERSON>, said the boat was attacked two days later by two Thai fishing vessels. She said two fishermen armed with knives boarded the Vietnamese boat and robbed its passengers, and then they took her, 10 women, and three boys aboard their own boats. She said the pirates then rammed the Vietnamese boat six or seven times and sank it. About half of those on board disappeared under water as soon as the boat went down, she said, and she believes the rest drowned later. The refugee said she and the 10 women were kept on one of the fishing boats for about a week, raped by five of eight fishermen, and later thrown overboard. She said someone on a passing boat threw her a buoy but refused to take her aboard. A Thai fishing boat finally brought her ashore on June 28. The police officer said Miss Cuc been living with the family of one of the fishermen and only recently decided to tell police in the southern town of <LOCATION> Pattani </LOCATION> about the attack. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said there were no reports about the fate of the other Vietnamese taken aboard the fishing boats. Pirates have been attacking boat people in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> since the refugees began fleeing their homeland following the Communist takeover in 1975. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said the latest attack was the 48th reported this year. Police so far have arrested 14 suspects in connection with six other cases, he said. Some officials say most of the pirates are not professional criminals but fishermen who chance upon the refugee boats and see them as easy targets. Officials say the pirates generally try to kill all refugees so there will be no witnesses.

<HEAD>Suspect Says Black Teen's Fatal Shooting Was Not Racial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sixth arrest has been made in connection with the death of a black teen-ager who police said was attacked by a gang of whites, and tempers appeared to be cooling in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Police searching for the young man suspected of firing the fatal shot were reported considering the possibility he might have fled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Another young man, who police believe was the leader of the gang of whites, said the killing was not racially motivated. Police said the gang in the mostly <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> attacked four black youths, who had gone to look at a car for sale, because they believed the four were going to visit a young woman who had spurned one of the gang members. A shot was fired and 16-year-old <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was killed. On Monday, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, 20, surrendered to police and was charged with first-degree assault, first-degree riot, aggravated harassment, menacing and civil rights violations, police said. Five others who had been arrested were released on bail Sunday. Also on Monday, there were signs that tempers were cooling off following two days of racial confrontations. About a dozen blacks led about 150 white residents on a short walk through the streets where the killing occurred. Dozens of people, angry over a third day of demonstrations in their neighborhood, stood facing the demonstrators but were quieter and less confrontational than residents had been Saturday and Sunday. The purported group leader, 18-year-old <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the youths believed the victim was among a group coming to the <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> neighborhood to beat up residents. `` I was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my friends up and the only reason the baseball bats were on the scene were because we wanted to protect ourselves and we did n't know if they were going to be armed,'' <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> said the attack could have occurred `` no matter what color they were. If someone was coming to beat me and my friends, we would do anything to protect ourselves.'' Police say at least one witness has named 18-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> as the gunman. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that detectives believe <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> remains in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but are checking to see if he has fled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> holds dual American and Italian citizenship.

<TEXT>
 Teacher strikes in several small districts in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> delayed the start of school for more than 24,000 students. In eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, seven schools opened today in the Indian <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> despite a strike by its 180 teachers. Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguiar </PERSON> said absenteeism appeared to be about 50 percent among the 3,150 students. He declined to estimate how many teachers and replacements were working. In the largest school district affected, 550 northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> teachers voted to stay away from the scheduled start of class today for 8,000 pupils in the debt-ridden Warren schools in a dispute over wages and class size. Teachers were demanding a 10 percent pay raise in the third year of a proposed contract. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the 192 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> went on strike Monday afternoon, after talks broke down with the local school board earlier in the day. The district canceled the first day of classes today for some 3,200 students until further notice. The strike is the first for the rural district southwest of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. The 3,700 students in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> were sent home Monday on their first day of classes, after their 225 teachers went on strike over salaries, teachers' aides and retirement benefits. School officials said classes were canceled today for all students except high school seniors, who are being taught by administrators. Teachers also were on strike today in three <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> school districts affecting 6,669 students and 316 teachers. The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said bargainers reached tentative settlements in 10 school districts, leaving 19 with negotiations at a critical stage and strikes possible. Picket lines were up in the 3,468-student <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION> district near <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> after talks broke off Sunday night. The district has 149 teachers.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> hit the airwaves a few hours after he was sentenced to a year in prison and tried to convince skeptical listeners he deserves a new trial to reverse his perjury conviction. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, accompanied by his pregnant wife <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, appeared Monday on two television news shows and two radio programs, including a 2 -LCB- - hour appearance on a radio call-in show More appearances were planned this afternoon. `` This is not about my political career,'' the 38-year-old conservative Republican said following his sentencing in federal court. `` This is not about whether I should be in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't stand by and let the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be trashed,'' he said. `` That's why I'm doing it.'' `` This man violated federal law,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. `` He will do time in jail for his misdeeds.'' As a result of his conviction, the State Bar of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Monday to begin proceedings that could lead to disbarment of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, an attorney. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to 12 months in prison on each of nine counts of perjury, with the terms to run concurrently. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> also fined <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> $ 30,000, plus $ 450 in court costs. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was convicted June 20 of lying to a federal grand jury last year about negotiations for an $ 850,000 loan from a federal agent posing as a money launderer. The loan, to help finance <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s $ 1.5 million home in suburban <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>, did not go through. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who will remain free while pursuing an appeal, said the judge's decision to grant him an appeal bond was an indication he would win a new trial. `` All I ask is a fair opportunity to present my case in a fair court,'' he said. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, who had sought a sentence of more than three years in prison, said the government may appeal to obtain a tougher penalty. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said the government's sentencing recommendation was unjustified because prosecutors had not proved <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was personally involved in laundering money. In his public appearances, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was alternately righteous and glib about his situation. He told one caller that he was fooled by federal agents posing as drug-money launderers because `` I'm not used to dealing with criminals. I may have to get used to it soon.'' Some callers supported <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s claims that he was the victim of an unfair trial and an overzealous prosecutor, but many others castigated him for refusing to admit his guilt as decided by the jury. At his sentencing, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> gave a 30-minute statement recounting his reasons for appealing his case, but said he stood before <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> `` in all humility.'' The judge disagreed. `` You do n't know the meaning of humility, Mr. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I thought you were beginning to learn it, but I'm afraid you're not.'' Evidence presented at <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s trial included tapes of his conversations with an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a money man, and with political supporter <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy. The conversations continued even after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told the grand jury he had `` walked away'' from the proposed deal. The congressman ultimately accepted and endorsed a $ 150,000 check before backing out. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was largely unknown politically before he won the 4th Congressional District seat in 1984, upsetting veteran Democrat <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitas </PERSON>. He was re-elected in 1986 but lost the seat in 1988 to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> after being indicted for perjury. LeChasney, who testified against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, awaits sentencing.

 Logging was allowed close to two nests of the rare northern spotted owl, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist testified at the last of a series of hearings on the bird's status. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Siuslaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> recently allowed logging within 100 yards of two of the 11 breeding pairs known to exist in the forest, <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> testified at the hearing Monday. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> held the hearings to determine whether to protect the spotted owl as a threatened species. `` It worries me that on a forest with only 11 breeding pairs of owls, they can endanger two of their pairs,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. The Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proposed threatened species status for the owl last June, saying logging in old growth forests in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> was destroying the bird's habitat. The Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has estimated only 1,500 nesting pairs of northern spotted owls remain in its range from southern <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The timber industry maintains that if the owl is listed as threatened, thousands of jobs will be lost to preserve old-growth forests, where the biggest and most valuable timber is found as habitat for the bird. Environmentalists say only 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s ancient forests remain and the declining numbers of owls signal the disappearance of an entire ecosystem. An estimated 500 people turned out for Monday's hearing, many of them wearing yellow T-shirts or yellow buttons to show solidarity with the timber industry. The hearing drew nearly 150 speakers, more than earlier <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hearings in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The majority of the testimony Monday came from timber industry workers and supporters, who called on the <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to remember that thousands of jobs are at stake. `` Your agency has never before had to consider the listing of a species which, if listed, would have as catastrophic -LRB- an -RRB- affect on people's lives as this one,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, staff forester for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>.

<HEAD>First Hydrogen Protogalaxy Found</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 3rd graf, The discovery, with Big Bang threory challenged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> says astronomers believe they have stumbled across evidence that galaxies may still be forming in the universe. The evidence is a massive cloud of hydrogen, 10 times larger than the Milky Way galaxy, all by itself and close by astronomical standards _ 65 million light-years away, the foundation said Monday. The discovery would appear to challenge the current belief that all galaxies were formed within the first few hundred million years after the `` Big Bang'' explosion dispersed hydrogen and matter in the universe. The hydrogen cloud was found by <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON>, adjunct professor of astronomy at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and head of the radio astronomy group at the foundation's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ionosphere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arecibo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and co-worker, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, associate professor of astronomy at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. `` Before stumbling into this thing, neither I nor <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> were great believers in the existence of such objects,'' <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON> said. `` But this cloud indicates that the discs of galaxies can form slowly throughout the history of the universe and not just be something that happened during some magic period in the distant past.'' <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> found the cloud while calibrating detectors attached to the 1,000-foot dish radio telescope at <LOCATION> Arecibo </LOCATION>. For calibration, they pointed the dish at a region of the sky thought to be devoid of objects _ and found the characteristic radio signal of hydrogen. Astronomers believe galaxies, massive groupings of millions to billions of stars, must form from the condensation of hydrogen, the simplest element _ a proton accompanied by an electron. Previous searches for cloud `` protogalaxies'' had failed to find anything, though there is strong evidence for the existence of clouds of hydrogen.

 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., is asking the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to investigate his former relationship with a male prostitute `` Questions have been raised about my employment of a personal assistant during a period between 1985 to 1987,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote in a letter to the chairman of the ethics committee. `` I have publicly responded to these questions, and I have expressed regret for the mistaken judgment involved. `` In order to ensure that the public record is clear, I hereby request that the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct conduct an investigation into these matters,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in Monday's letter to committee Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. House rules require that a member act `` at all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House. The ethics committee already is looking into cases involving three other members accused of sexual improprieties. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> pledged to cooperate fully with investigators and asked that the probe be conducted quickly. The liberal Democrat acknowledged Friday that he had paid for sex with a male prostitute, then hired the man, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, to do household chores and run errands. Saying he was `` victimized,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he fired <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> two years ago when he became suspicious that <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> was selling sex from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Capitol Hill apartment. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> alleges <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> knew about the prostitution ring at his apartment. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> denies that. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> said he asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to investigate other charges related to prostitution, including running a bawdy house and soliciting for prostitution. `` Many people do n't think <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> confessed to a crime. He has,'' <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> `` is saying is that every gay person in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> who is not totally abstinent is a criminal.'' The congressman said he did n't think he or anyone else in such a situation should be prosecuted. In another development, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sengel </PERSON> said today he will file a motion Friday to drop charges against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> political consultant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON>, accused of trying to arrange sex with a 13-year-old girl through <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. `` After reviewing the case with police, it was our determination that evidence which we had is not sufficient to sustain the allegation that Mr. <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON> solicited a crime,'' <PERSON> Sengel </PERSON> said. `` For that reason we are dismissing the charge.'' <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON> is scheduled to appear in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> district court Friday for a closed hearing. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and fellow <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> are the two House members who have publicly acknowledged they are homosexual. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s announcement came in 1987, and he was overwhelmingly re-elected to a fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote. Two polls published over the weekend showed that voters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' 4th District still strongly support <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 49, made two public appearances in <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, over the weekend where a few muffled `` boos'' were overwhelmed by applause and cheers. `` I guess it means people think I've done a good job in the past,'' he said. `` People are being nicer to me than I'm ready to be to myself right now.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, called on <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to resign. `` The Democrats are arguing this is a personal matter.

The other three House members being investigated by the ethics committee are: Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., some of whose former female staff members allege he sexually harassed them; Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., who allegedly fondled a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteer while on an official trip to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> in March; and Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, convicted May 30 of contributing to the unruliness of a minor as a result of alleged sexual intercourse with a teen-age

<TEXT>
 A sheriff's deputy has been charged with criminally negligent homicide for shooting a cookie salesman during a routine traffic stop in front of the salesman's home. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON>, 29, was charged Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the July 15 death of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 36, a salesman for <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>. Police say <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the back of the head after pulling him over in front of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> home for an apparent drunken-driving check. `` Deputy <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON>'s actions ... grossly deviated from the standard of care that a reasonable person in like circumstances and under a like standard of care would exercise,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON> has declined to discuss the shooting with investigators, and has been on paid administrative leave. If convicted, the deputy could face one to four years in jail and a fine ranging to $ 100,000. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the jail sentence could be extended to eight years under exceptional circumstances. The shooting has prompted criticism of the sheriff's office by some <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> residents, who said the episode epitomized the sometimes overzealous law enforcement in the county. `` It seems to me if there was a shot in the back of the head, it would be more than negligent,'' said attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixt </PERSON>, who is representing <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s estate. But <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said elements were lacking for the filing of murder charges. Police reports say the shooting occurred after <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON> pulled <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s car over and radioed headquarters to verify <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s license number and driver's license. A transcript of radio transmissions the night of the slaying showed the sheriff's dispatcher had just acknowledged <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON>'s call when <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON> yelled, `` I need backup. The dispatch center then was unable to contact <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON> on the radio. A short time later, a neighbor of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s called police to say an officer had asked her to call for assistance because there had been a shooting.

<TEXT>
 Moldavians today pushed forward in parliamentary debate on a new draft law to make the local dialect the official language of the republic, but non-Moldavian strikers and protesters charged the measure was discriminatory. In the restive <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, an activist said Monday that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cautioned <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> against pushing too hard for autonomy. The legislature of the southern Soviet republic voted 300 to 43 not to delay debate on the bill, despite objections by deputies from two cities where 80,000 non-Moldavian workers have been striking since last week to protest the law. Three deputies abstained and 30 were absent. The vote on the bill was expected by Wednesday. Around <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, capital of this republic on the Romanian border, viewers watched the session on television in both Russian and Moldavian, a Romanian dialect. The Russians, Ukrainians and other ethnic groups comprise more than a third of the republic's population. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that ethnic activists in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> are trying to `` take power on the crest of a muddy wave of chauvinism and separatism.'' Moldavian activists said the opera theater where the lawmaking body was meeting was ringed by police as several hundred people gathered across the street waving red-blue-and-yellow banners of the republic's colors. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s party chief, <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, on Friday and Sunday to express his concern about the independence movement in the republic, activist <PERSON> Romaldus </PERSON> <PERSON> Olozus </PERSON> said. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said separatists were leading the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> toward trouble. The statement came days after 1 million <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> people joined hands in a chain to protest the 1939 agreement between <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> that forced the independent <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> in the Soviet sphere of influence. Olozus, a member of the governing council of the Sajudis grassroots movement, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> that he and four colleagues met with <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> members, `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is concerned about what's happening in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> _ that what had happened so far was worth supporting, but that now we'd gone too far,'' Olozus said by telephone. No special meeting of Sajudis was planned to discuss the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> reaction, but <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Vytautus </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> was scheduled to speak tonight on Lithanian television, <PERSON> Olozus </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> said the republic's party agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment that the Baltic region was in danger of falling into `` an abyss'' if they heeded separatist calls for secession, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today The government of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the Communist Party of the third <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, came into line Monday behind the statement from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> party issued a statement calling the party's stance `` the basis for concrete action for normalizing the social-political situation in the country.'' In <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, the presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet legislature rejected a commission's findings that the incorporation of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1940 was an `` international crime.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government newspaper, said the findings did not take into account <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s political situation in 1939-40, and would `` lead the republic into a political dead-end and serve poorly in the transfer to economic independence.'' It returned the Supreme Soviet commission's work until a national panel finishes its review, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Olozus </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> apparently was upset with the findings of the Lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legal argument for full independence. <PERSON> Olozus </PERSON> said he had an impression from talking to <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not entirely support the strident tone of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> statement, but that `` his reaction was one of disappointment.'' The confrontation with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was `` inescapable,'' but the resistance might slow down the Sajudis-led drive for greater autonomy, if not outright independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Olozus </PERSON> said. The grass-roots movement will continue on the same path, `` but the steps can be slower or faster, depending on the concrete situation,'' he said. The labor daily Trud today attacked Moldavian nationalists, saying they `` stepped up bitterness, mutual hostility and suspicion'' among ethnic groups. Representatives of the Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> on Monday met leaders of a council representing non-Moldavian workers who have been on strike since last week to protest the draft language law, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. On Sunday, up to 300,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> in favor of the language law. Pravda on Monday said that the crowd drawn to <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>'s Lenin Square on Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had `` submitted to long-term brainwashing by nationalist-minded ideologists.'' Non-Moldavians are concerned the language law will be the first step toward a policy of discriminating against non-Moldavians.

 A bitter, ethnically charged battle between a Cuban-born state senator and a Jewish lawyer sparked heavy turnout today as voters went to the polls to pick a successor to the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. `` Normally, when the polls open we might have one person waiting to vote. Today at that time, there were five,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, a veteran election inspector at one <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> polling place. At 11 a.m., based on initial results from polls, the elections department was projecting that 42.8 percent of eligible voters would turn out, far higher than normal for a special election. Voting was heaviest in the Cuban-American precints where Republican <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> was strongest, with central Little <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> residents turning out a projected 77.3 percent clip. By contrast, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> condominium precincts, where Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> has the advantage, were projected to have a 46.3 percent turnout. ` It's been a very controversial election,'' Elections Supervisor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` There has been a tremendous amount of media exposure, and we think both camps are getting a lot more people out to vote.'' Many Cuban-Americans were upset by the tone of the <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s campaign His early slogan was `` This is an American Seat.'' <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s defenders said he had been unfairly labeled as prejudiced, and said the campaign phrase was merely <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s answer to Republican claims that the seat should belong to a Cuban-American. The <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an independent panel, criticized both candidates as appealing to voter prejudice, blasting Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> for a Spanish-language brochure that it said made a veiled ethnic attack on <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, a Jew. `` No, we were n't born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, like him. No, we do n't speak English the same way he does ... We, too, are Americans,'' said the brochure Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> has refused to debate <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, calling him a bigot. She campaigned Monday with Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> among senior citizens in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> _ an area heavily favored to back her Democratic opponent. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> spent part of the day before the election in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and also visited with black ministers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Polls last week indicated the race was too close to call and that most voters in the diverse district would choose ethnic heritage, not partisanship, at the ballot box. The area Pepper represented for 27 years, until his death May 30 at age 88, has 100,149 registered Democrats, 71,295 registered Republicans and 14,098 independents. Blacks make up 19 percent of the district's registered voters. More than 40 percent of the district's registered voters are <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON>, and the rest are non-Latin whites, sometimes known locally as `` Anglos.'' <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, 48, the Brooklyn-born former <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president, hoped for a strong turnout from the traditional Jewish-retiree-black Democratic coalition, a group that has seen its traditional power in the area eroded by the Latin influx into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. A large turnout was expected from Cuban-Americans seeking to make Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 37, the first Cuban-American elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> also has a growing population of Nicaraguans. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said that 7,961 Democrats and 5,965 Republicans had requested absentee ballots as of the weekend; 4,800 had been returned by Monday, but no breakdown was available. `` This is a unique situation where the parties really encouraged people to vote absentee ballot and I'm not sure what that will do to the returns,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament today approved all 22 nominations to President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s new Cabinet, the country's official news agency reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, described the vote of confidence by the 270-member <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION> as `` unprecedented'' since some members of all previous Cabinet slates had been rejected in the past. The vote came after <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> got a last-minute boost for his proposed Cabinet today from radical Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>. `` I see Mr. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s Cabinet as a successful one and one that supports the deprived ... and whose members have worked hard for the revolution,'' <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, on the third day of a debate on <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s Cabinet: `` It is a Cabinet that has experience, proficiency, competence and faith with full revolutionary credentials. Earlier, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspapers had warned that as many as three of the nominees could be rejected. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has come under fire from radicals for dumping their leaders from his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. They included outgoing Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who has been closely linked with Shiite Moslem militants holding most of the Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>'s support was seen as critical for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 55, who was elected by a landslide vote July 28, after two days of debate in which some of his nominees have incurred severe criticism from radical deputies. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, a hard-line radical who has advocated the violent spread of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution, is allied to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s rivals. But he apparently has fallen in line with <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, who last week urged parliamentary deputies to set aside their differences and approve <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s Cabinet to ensure a smooth transition from the outgoing government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> was elected to succeed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died June 3. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s so-called pragmatists, as Speaker last month. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s new-look <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> includes more technocrats, many of them Western-educated, than revolutionary ideolgues. He has said his main priority is to revitalize <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s sagging economy, battered by eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and a decade of mismanagement.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> complained just weeks before he resigned in 1987 that he did n't live as well as other evangelists, a former aide testified today at <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud and conspiracy trial. `` We were at ORU -LRB- Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and they were showing us around,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said that he lived shabbily compared to Oral Roberts ... and other ministers.'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, who was convicted last month of tax evasion, said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> made the comment while they were in Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' office in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The office, he said, `` is about the size of thos courtroom.'' He also testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had become fascinated with real estate investments and had said he wanted to invest his bonus payments from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in land. `` He told me he wanted to have 10 homes,'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> also said the <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s parsonage electric bill usually ran about $ 1,800 to $ 2,000 a month because `` the pool was kept at a very high temperature ... in the 90s.'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> began his testimony on Monday, the first day of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s federal court trial He testified then that the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry founder used church money to pay <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to keep silent about their tryst. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said his former boss also used official funds to buy homes, expensive cars and to finance luxurious trips to seaside resorts. A prosecutor, citing what he called excesses in <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lifestyle, said on one occasion the minister and his wife bought $ 100 worth of cinnamon buns from a bakery because they liked the aroma, and threw the rolls out from their hotel suite three days later without eating a single one <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is charged with 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy and could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $ 5 million if found guilty of all of them. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> quit <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 amid revelations about his 1980 sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and a $ 265,000 payoff to her. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> payment was made without <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s knowledge. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> complained about his salary and told him top <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives diverted funds for their own use. `` I remember Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> saying he wanted to be paid like <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> testified. `` He said some fund-raisers got up to 10 percent of what they took in.'' Prosecutors say <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other executives at the evangelical empire diverted for their own benefit at least $ 4 million of the $ 158 million they raised by selling `` lifetime partnerships'' at the ministry's resort hotels. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said his client is innocent and called him a `` creative religious genius.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did n't `` sell'' anything, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` What happened was gifts or donations. This was a church.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> blamed problems at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> on trusted lieutenants and noted that former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, are convicted felons. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in exchange for testimony against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Tribal militants today detonated a bomb hidden in a bus in northeast <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, killing at least 12 passengers a day after tribal leaders agreed to suspend the campaign of separatist violence, news reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said the bomb exploded on a state-owned bus in the state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, where militants from the Bodo tribes have been fighting for their own state. The news agency quoted unidentified officials as saying the bomb was planted by <PERSON> Bodo </PERSON> militants and left at least 12 people and 35 injured. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Bodo </PERSON> leaders said they had agreed to temporarily halt their separatist campaign as a result of talks with federal government officials and the chief minister of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state. But <PERSON> Upendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Brama </PERSON>, one of the leaders, said the demand for a separate Bodo state must be met by 1990 or the group would resume violence. The Bodos have been demanding a separate homeland on the northern bank of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brahmaputrain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, a remote and hilly state bordering <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>. The Bodos, mostly farmers of Mongol origin, were animists before they converted earlier this century to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Christianity. They make up about 30 percent of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>'s 20 million people. The Bodos claim they suffer discrimination from the Assamese and accuse them of mass migration to Bodo-dominated land. `` We will go to any extent to get our demand for a separate, full-fledged Bodoland on the northern bank of <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, implemented by 1990,'' <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> after the talks Monday. The violence has seriously affected the economy of the tea - and timber-growing state `` It is good news that both the sides have agreed to work for peace and not to encourage violence,'' <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> J.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dass </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Dass </PERSON> said that during the talks, the Bodos agreed to stop attacks on government and in return, the <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> government would not to invoke special police powers to detain suspects without trial for up to one year. `` From our side, we will stop all actions against the Bodos with the hope that they will abide by the agreement,'' <PERSON> Dass </PERSON> said. `` But if they resume their violent campaign, we will use force against them.'' The Bodo problem has been simmering for more than 20 years, but it turned violent earlier this year. Bodo leaders claim that 1,500 of their comrades have died in police actions by the <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> government and that 15,000 houses have been damaged by Assamese, leaving 100,000 people homeless. <PERSON> Dass </PERSON>, however, said only 395 people, including 41 policemen and 16 state officials, had been killed this year. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, another hub of separatist violence, police said today that Sikh militants set off a bomb at a railroad track and closed down the rail line. A.K. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, senior police superintendent at <LOCATION> Majitha </LOCATION>, said at least six feet of nearby track were destroyed Monday by the bomb, but no one was injured. He said seven empty train cars derailed when they approached the damaged track. Sikh radicals have been fighting for an independent nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. They claim discrimination by the Hindus, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s religious majority. On Sunday, masked Sikh gunmen raided a passenger train in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and massacred at least 22 Hindu passengers.

 A casino under construction on an American Indian reservation was set aflame by residents opposed to gambling parlors on Indian territory, witnesses say. A power transformer was shot out near two other casinos on the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Regis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mohawk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, where pro- and anti-gambling forces have clashed since a gambling raid last month, state police said today. Power was restored to the Bear's Den and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s Vegas International by 5:30 a.m. today, said <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> district manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>. No homes were affected, he said. Troopers were investigating the incident, which occurred about 11 p.m. Monday, but no arrests had been made, according to a state police spokesman who would not give his name. The Lucky Knight Casino, which was scheduled to open today, was heavily damaged in the fire Sunday night after a confrontation between a pro- and anti-gambling factions. A brief standoff between the <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a self-appointed reservation security force, and state police followed the disturbance. Casino owner <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said she had just left the building when a mob stormed it and set the fire with Molotov cocktails. She said the mob tried to burn other casinos but armed guards stopped them. State police, in a statement, said the conflict at the casino involved more than 500 people and lasted about six hours. While state troopers set up roadblocks to route traffic around the reservation, <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> members, expecting state police to intervene, set up their own armed checkpoints just inside the reservation. After several tense hours, both sides relinquished their respective strongholds along the perimeter of the reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canadian border in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The reservation was the site of a 10-day standoff between troopers and Indians after a gambling raid July 20 by state and federal authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Mohawks </ORGANIZATION> voted this month to permit gambling on the reservation, but some Indians claim the vote was invalid. State police and tribal leaders reached an agreement this month to resume patrols on the reservation, but the <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has said they would allow troopers on their land only with advance notice and escorts. Although casino gambling is illegal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, the reservation's seven casinos offer slot machines and card games that attract gamblers from both sides of the border. The Mohawks contend they are not bound by state or federal gambling laws since they consider their reservation a sovereign nation.

<HEAD>Art Show Protests Proposed Flag Desecration Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of artists says it wants to enlighten, not offend, with a show on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag that includes a painting of the Statue of Liberty giving a Nazi salute against the backdrop of an American banner. The 10 artists _ students and former students at <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> _ are exhibiting their works in a month-long show opening Sept. 12 called `` Flagging Our Freedom.'' The exhibit in a campus gallery is funded by a campus literary magazine and has the support of the chairman of the art department. The exhibit is motivated by proposed laws against flag desecration and by the threat of the government withdrawing money for art considered offensive. `` By no means are we trying to do shock art,'' organizer <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to do good art.'' Oroc, an artist who goes by the one name, had a piece among those previewed Monday. In his oil painting `` 21st Century <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a grimacing Statue of Liberty makes a Nazi salute. A swastika is painted on the tablet on her arm, and pennies reading `` In Dog We Trust'' cover her breasts. Behind her is a wrinkled, backwards American flag and the corner of a dollar bill. Christ is crucified on the `` one'' of the bill. `` To me the Statue of Liberty is really a joke,'' said Oroc, a 24-year-old Union City resident. The work's message is that the nation celebrates freedom but tolerates racism, homelessness, exclusion of immigrants and worship of wealth, he said. <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>' contribution is a multi-media sculpture inside half a cat-carrying box. What appears to be a row of toy soldiers marches on top of a flag. A doll's head lies in back, its arm poking through the row of soldiers. `` The Big Parade'' is an anti-war statement, and the flag represents `` mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The artists have a range of opinions over proper treatment of the flag but agree their right to use it to express themselves should not be limited, he said. They are reacting in part to a recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision protecting flag burning as free speech. The students also said they were reacting to cuts of federal grants by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to museums that sponsored the controversial work of photographers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. A spokesman for the state Veterans of Foreign Wars, which favors a constitutional amendment against flag burning, said he would reserve judgment on the show. `` It all depends on the works of art they're displayng,'' said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. `` I absolutely do support the show,'' said art department chairwoman <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dierks </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Of the students, she said, `` I think they are rather exceptional.''

 The head of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s intelligence service said in an interview published Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> no longer controls his organization. Police Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that situation reports no longer are being given to leading members of the party, and `` only state leaders are entitled to this right.'' The formal transfer of control from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the government has had little practial effect, however, because all government leaders are also ranking Communists. After endorsing the concept of multiparty democracy in February, the reform-minded communist leadership began transfering to the government formal supervisory rights to organizations it had traditionally controlled, including the armed forces and the police. The moves are in preparation for free parliamentary elections next year.

<TEXT>
 A judge with a penchant for creative sentences has ordered nearly 100 traffic offenders to watch a TV special on safe driving. `` We have a nice group of youthful offenders who come from the upper economic strata. Fining them 40 or 50 bucks is n't going to do anything,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchester </PERSON>, a judge in the suburban enclave The Village. The judge said he had ordered 75 to 100 offenders to watch Tuesday night's `` Valvoline National Driving Test'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. The 25-question test will cover defensive driving, rules of the road and basic mechanics. Offenders must return their completed test booklets to the 48-year-old judge, who used to race motorcycles and subscribes to Hot Rod magazine. It's not the first time <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> has handed out an unusual punishment in the city of 12,000. `` I have required kids to do the family laundry,'' <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> said. `` One of my favorite things is, if I have a young offender who is driving a fairly new car, I check to see whether the parents bought it. If they did, I have the offender wash and wax the parents' car.'' Other offenders have been required to write reports. Some had to interview the police officer who made the arrest `` so they'll know that officer is human and not some cretin just trying to stop their fun,'' he said. `` I've had them interview doctors or nurses in emergency rooms,'' the judge said. `` What is trauma? How much pressure does it take to snap a neck, to turn someone into a quadriplegic?'' Then there was the teen-ager who said he was driving fast to make the heater come on more quickly. `` I had him do a report on how a cooling system functions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He came back in and said, ` That was really silly of me, was n't it?' I said, ` Yes, but I could have told you that and you would n't have understood me.'''

 There was `` mass confusion'' in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> last year after 13 bombs were stashed around the southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> town, local law enforcement officials testified today. `` We felt like we were dealing with something we did n't know too much about,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> testified at the trial of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 42, one of two men accused of planting the bombs. The prosecutor in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, said in his opening statement Monday that the town `` was paralyzed'' by the attempted bombings on July 5, 1988. But defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was an honest, law-abiding citizen and a family man. `` He's never been in trouble with the law,'' <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said. In today's testimony, Police Chief <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Boling </PERSON> said authorities cordoned off downtown streets for about 12 hours while teams searched for more bombs. `` Nobody could understand what was going on. There was mass confusion for a while as to why they could n't drive through town,'' <PERSON> Boling </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> are accused of planting dynamite bombs under bridges and behind buildings in the town nearly 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on July 5, 1988. Three of the bombs ignited and fizzled, but none exploded and no one was hurt. The bombs were allegedly targeted at state Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Authorities declined to comment on a motive, but a criminal complaint called <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> a `` lifelong rival'' of <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>, who is also the son of <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>'s mayor. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, who worked at the same factory, were arrested last May and indicted on one count of unlawful possession of dynamite, one count of conspiracy, 14 counts of making bombs and 13 of attempting to destroy roads and buildings affecting interstate commerce. If convicted, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 285 years in prison. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> is to be tried after <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said evidence would show that <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, a technical engineer, helped <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> make the bombs and that the tools used to make them belonged to <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> cautioned that much of the government's case was based on circumstantial evidence. `` Do n't expect somebody to come up and say they saw them making the devices,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> would not dispute allegations he told <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> various things about making bombs, but would deny any involvement in a plot to blow up <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. `` The evidence will show he knew how to make bombs,'' <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said. `` He is a survivalist. He wants to be self-sufficient in the event of a nuclear war. He wants to be able to sustain himself, his family.'' <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> said such people are not part of a `` lunatic fringe'' simply because they are concerned about their future and their family's safety. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, who wore a dark suit and tie, sat quietly at a table in the courtroom, taking notes on a yellow legal pad.

 Syrian gunners today shelled a tanker carrying fuel for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s besieged Christians, setting it on fire and killing seven crewmen, police reported. Two Lebanese crewmen were wounded and rescued by coast guard vessels. Two others were missing and feared dead. The seven victims, including Lebanese captain <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Garabedian </PERSON>, were washed ashore on the coastal strip held by the Christians several hours after the Maltese-flag tanker was hit, police reported. The incident touched off a fierce five-hour artillery battle between the Syrians and the Christian forces of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in and around divided <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said three people were killed and 16 wounded in the barrage, which dwindled to intermittent mortar and machine gun exchanges by 8:30 a.m. -LRB- 1:30 a.m. EDT -RRB-. That raised the casualty toll since fighting erupted March 8 to at least 795 people killed and 2,263 wounded. Police said only two Lebanese among 11 crewmen aboard were rescued. One of the survivors, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Saddiq </PERSON>, said the tanker was attacked with missiles by `` a Syrian gunboat'' enforcing the 5-month-old blockade off the Christian-held coast during the night. But a police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the ship was shelled by radar-controlled <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> howitzers deployed along the seafront in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian artillery batteries along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seafront also fired on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s positions and the shelling quickly spread to residential districts, police reported. Police said the ship, identified as the <LOCATION> Sunshield </LOCATION>, was hit at least once by radar-guided artillery about seven miles off <LOCATION> Maameltein </LOCATION>, an area 11 miles north of this war-torn capital. The crew included five Lebanese, four Egyptians and two Ghanaians. Police said only three of the bodies, all Lebanese, were identified. <PERSON> Saddiq </PERSON>, 24, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dieu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where he was being treated for severe burns, that a Syrian gunboat approached to within 10 yards around 2:20 a.m. The police spokesman said he had no information on the ship's tonnage, registry or owners He said the Sunshield was carrying 550,000 gallons of gasoline purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government headed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, which is vying for power with a rival Syrian-backed Moslem Cabinet. A tugboat succeeded in getting a line on the burning ship early today and towed it to within a half-mile of the coast as firefighters battled to extinguish the blaze, the spokesman reported. Dozens of ships have managed to evade a Syrian blockade to deliver weapons and other supplies in recent weeks, but there is a critical shortage of gasoline and other fuel in the enclave. About 1 million residents live in the enclave. Seven other cargo ships attempting to run the blockade have been hit by the Syrians since March 16. At least two seamen have been killed. Syrian gunners have also daily shelled the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, seeking to sever the sea link with <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, 100 miles to the northeast. <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> is the enclave's main port. The fighting flared today as <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, Secretary-General of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for talks with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem leaders in a new peace effort to halt the bloodletting. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital, since Sunday meeting Syrian leaders following the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation efforts. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mandate to halt <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war, which erupted in April 1975. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which considers <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within its sphere of influence and vital to its security, backs demands by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem and leftists for an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has accepted to negotiate political reforms. But he has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s troops out of the predominantly Moslem sectors they have controlled since 1976. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders charge that the Syrians abrogated their <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate by openly siding with the Moslems in the 14-year-old civil war, in which more than 150,000 people have been killed.

 An Italian satellite launched to collect data on the stars has failed to reach orbit, and authorities are prepared to ask <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> space authorities for funding for a second satellite, an official said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 About 15 tons of security files kept on citizens were destroyed in a blast furnace Tuesday in a symbolic act marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the Greek Civil War. As the files were dropped into the main furnace of a steel mill 13 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, flames shot upward and scattered cinders throughout the plant. The cinders were the remains of dossiers on the activities and political leanings of millions of Greeks considered a threat to the state since 1944. Government spokesman <PERSON> Athanassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanellopoulos </PERSON> said former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> had added to the files by keeping records on citizens from 1982-87. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who was defeated in the June 18 general election, had pledged that all the security files would be destroyed. The government said he had failed to fulfill his promise during his tenure. Last week, the government announced that 16.5 million files would be burned to mark the end of divisions between left and right that followed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat in the three-year uprising. The Civil War ended unofficially on Aug. 29, 1949, when all hostilities stopped between the Communists and government forces backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I think that all Greeks wanted to see the end of these relics of the Civil War,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> general secretary <PERSON> Mihalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutelidakis </PERSON>. The decision to destroy the files was made by Premier <PERSON> Tzannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON>, who heads a government comprising the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party and the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress. The coalition government said its main task before calling new elections by the end of October would be to investigate scandals allegedly perpetrated by the socialists and to pass legislation leading to conciliation among Greeks. The destruction of the files met some opposition from citizens and politicians. About 50 people, mostly supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, gathered at the gates of the steelworks and tried to block police trucks with the files. `` A nation which has no memory has no history!'' they chanted. <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> deputies, the <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> and Justice Minister <PERSON> Fotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouvelis </PERSON>, a member of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, opposed burning the files, saying they were important documents that should be kept in archives for research. `` Whether or not the files are of historical value should be decided by historians, and should not be sacrificed for the sake of any symbolism,'' the university council said Monday. The government said that about 2,000 files on people who played a major role in the history of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> would be preserved.

<TEXT>
 Delegates to a peace conference canceled a formal meeting planned for today, and a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> official said warring <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> groups might wait until next year before they negotiate again. Representatives of the 19 nations spent the day working informally in small groups, then planned a working dinner followed by further consultations on the issues that have blocked a settlement in the monthlong conference. The formal session was postponed several times before finally being rescheduled for Wednesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with department practice, said the conference would conclude Wednesday with a short statement that probably would recommend a reconvening the conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> several months from now, `` perhaps in the spring.'' The spokesman said there was `` no movement on the part of the Cambodian parties'' on two essential points _ composition of a proposed transitional government and an international mechanism for monitoring withdrawal of Vietnamese troops this month. `` It's too early for a compromise,'' he said. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official predicted today that the conference would be suspended, and a new round of fighting would follow. `` We see indications that we may be in for this period of military testing,'' the official told reporters, speaking on condition he not be further identified. The official suggested the conference could close, `` leaving open-ended the prospect of reconvening ... some months down the road when perhaps the realities on the ground have given people a clearer sense of the real balance of forces at play here.'' Fourteen foreign ministers present at the first session in late July have returned to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Quichen </PERSON>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> did not return because no resolution was in sight. Nineteen nations originally attended the conference with high hopes of laying the foundations for a lasting peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which has suffered two decades of civil war and slaughter. But no progress has been made in three weeks of working meetings. Some delegates said positions seem to have hardened among the Cambodian parties _ the Vietnamese-installed government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and the three-party resistance led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s ruler until 1970. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw the last of its forces by Sept. 27 with or without a settlement. The greatest obstacle remains the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, strongest of the resistance factions and responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1 million civilians due to purges or starvation from 1975 until its ouster by Vietnamese forces in 1978. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime came to power by defeating the U.S.-backed Cambodian government. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s heriditary ruler, says he would rather share power with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> than fight it in the jungles, while <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> says the group must be eliminated politically and militarily. `` There is a limit to which the rest of the world can impose a solution on the Cambodians,'' a weary Australian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said at the close of Monday's session.

 `` Steel Wheels'' -LRB- CBS -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> `` There's the sun, the moon, the trees and the Rolling Stones,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> says in describing the longevity that is the secret to this band's success. The Stones' new album, `` Steel Wheels,'' is as reassuring _ and predictable _ as the sun and the moon. The Rolling Stones, whose raunchy, guitar-based sound is the most instantly identifiable signature in rock music, sound simply terrific. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' guitar playing is exemplary, and the rhythm section of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> sounds inspired. Even <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, for all his whining about the need to do solo work, is undeniably more at home here than anywhere else. Thankfully, the Stones vary the output enough to keep `` Steel Wheels'' from lapsing into the boredom of the band's more recent records, particularly `` Dirty Work.'' The 12-song album contains three ballads, a blues song and the exotic sounding `` Continental Drift,'' which feature Moroccan drummers. Where the Stones stumble is in the lyrics. They rarely rise above the pedestrian and are occasionally insipid. For every rare, offhand funny lyric -LRB- `` So get off the fence, it's creasing your butt'' -RRB-, there's about a dozen nagging cliches After 34 albums, the Stones should know enough to avoid such lines as, `` I can feel your tongue on mine, silky smooth like wine. I'm living with these memories, that's all that's left of you and me.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s yowl, which renders much of the words indistinguishable anyway, is the signal that words are n't the most important thing for this band. The individual cuts: The opening `` Sad Sad Sad'' is a rocker in the classic Stones mold. The single `` Mixed Emotions'' is most interesting for armchair psychologists who want to apply the line `` you're not the only one with mixed emotions'' to the recent feuding between <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. `` Terrifying'' is a series of animal metaphors attached to a beat that recalls the 1970s `` Hot Stuff.'' `` Hold on to Your Hat'' is the sort of angry, `` get out of my life, witch,'' song that the Stones have been writing too much of lately, though <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> makes this tune with a strong shuffle beat. `` Blinded by Love'' is a pleasing country ballad that's sort of a cross between `` Lady Jane'' and `` Faraway Eyes.'' `` Rock and a Hard Place,'' with horns integrated into the traditional rock sound, is one of those songs that sound better if you do n't pay attention to the lyrics. `` Put on a kind face'' is <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s brief advice for such problems as human rights, war and the homeless. Both of <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' lead vocals, `` Ca n't Be Seen'' and `` Slipping Away'' are somewhat slight. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s ballad, `` Almost Hear You Sigh,'' is, again, lyrically problematic but pleasant sounding. `` Continental Drift,'' with the raucous Master Musicians of <LOCATION> Jajouka </LOCATION>, is the kind of strange experimentation that shows how the Stones are still better, when they want to be, than the legions of bands that try to imitate them. The verdict: `` Steel Wheels'' is no masterpiece, but it gives more evidence why the Rolling Stones are Hall of Fame members.

 Seven bombs apparently set by drug traffickers exploded early today, police said. The father of three reputed drug lords called for negotiations with the government to end drug-related violence. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s justice minister, <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, today pledged to stay in her job and continue fighting her country's drug lords despite death threats, and she appealed for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to protect judges There were no injuries in the bombings of six state liquor stores in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and a travel agency in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police said, but $ 100,000 of damage was caused. The bomb in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> blew up about 300 feet from a military base. Police blamed drug traffickers for the bombs, which went off between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. Police also blamed traffickers Sunday for nine bombings of banks in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. There were no claims of responsibility. <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, father of the reputed <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leaders <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, asked President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to `` end the blood-letting in our dear <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'' by negotiating with drug traffickers to end the violence. `` No more drug trafficking, no more war, no more assassinations, no more bombs,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> said in his message, which was dated Saturday and printed in local newspapers today. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> said drug traffickers are willing to negotiate for peace, but similar initiatives must be made by the government, leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups. Leftists groups often attack drug traffickers' extensive property holdings inside <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> said a dialogue with the government was a condition for peace, and he asked the government for `` forgiveness'' of the traffickers, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>'s three sons are among 12 people wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which enforcement agents believe is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, who began the unprecedented war on traffickers after the assassination of a leading presidential contender on Aug. 18, has refused all calls for negotiations with traffickers. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference, disputed widespread reports that she considered resigning in the face of death threats against her, her husband and the couple's 3-year-old son. The 32-year-old justice minister also said she was requesting $ 19 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to purchase armored cars, bulletproof vests, metal detectors for court houses and other security devices to protect the jurists. A <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> city councilwoman today said the government can win the war on drugs but must first get rid of police and government officials tied to the drug traffickers. `` The government has to take very definite action ... to purify it of those people who are in alliance with the criminals that the government and society is hoping to take to justice,'' said <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON>, whose name has appeared on a death list by the drug lords. `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> can not continue living in this bloodbath,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning'' from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> met privately Monday with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister to formally request extradition of a key narcotics trafficking suspect. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s justice minister and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> discussed extradition and millions of dollars of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police on Monday questioned two former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military officers about reports they trained gunmen for Colombian cocaine bosses. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a confidential report by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> security forces, reported today that at least five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and 11 British mercenaries helped train teams of assassins for Colombian cocaine traffickers and their right-wing allies. The army on Monday announced <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Majuat </PERSON>, identified as a top financial man for drug dealers, was detained last week at a ranch not far from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Authorities also seized about 4.5 tons of cocaine there, about 1 percent of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s yearly production, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics officials. Army officials said <PERSON> Majuat </PERSON> is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If so, he would be at least the fourth potentially extraditable suspect to be caught up in the nationwide sweep since Aug. 18. Foreign Ministry officials said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Londono </PERSON> <PERSON> Paredes </PERSON> met for 20 minutes Monday to discuss re-establishing a system of quotas for exports of coffee, once <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s principal cash product. But a meeting between the two was required to formally request the extradition of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an alleged finance chief for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is wanted by a federal court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in connection with a $ 1.2 billion money-laundering operation. As part of the crackdown, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> renewed its extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which had been nullified by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June 1987. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, in a videotaped message sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks Monday, called on rich countries to crack down on illicit drug use. `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s survival as the oldest democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is now at risk, but so is the safety of your streets,'' he said. `` What might seem to be a matter of purely personal habit has had explosive public consequences. It has thrown us all into a war we did not ask for.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> administrator has recommended upholding a veto of the controversial Two Forks Dam project, officials in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> said today. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has sought the dam on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to provide for the city's future water needs, but conservationists and Nebraskans have blasted the project as environmentally disastrous. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, both said they learned this morning of the decision by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Regional Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> announced his intention to veto the project last spring and appointed DeHihns to make a final study and issue a recommendation. The project still faces public hearings before a final <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decision is made. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said DeHihns based his decision on potential damage to fish, wildlife and recreation in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and fish and wildlife in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> did n't agree with <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s water need projections. `` They did n't believe the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had assembled numbers that supported their need,'' he said. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> declined to discuss details of the decision, but said, `` We did find some serious shortcomings in their rationale.'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON>, who has been reviewing the project for the past 4 -LCB- months, briefed <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on the agency's rationale. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathrop </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, declined comment on the reports and said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s official announcement was to be made later today. The 1.1 million-acre-foot dam project would flood 30 miles of Cheesman Canyon southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to create a reservoir for city water. Its cost has been estimated at between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said DeHihns' decision indicates that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials are willing to discuss alternative proposals to the dam and believe <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> could do more in the way of conservation `` It is possible that other alternatives could be detrimental to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, although the alternatives that were mentioned by <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> would not be,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said. He said he hoped the agency can select an alternative that is n't `` environmentally offensive,'' while still allowing for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s water

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dog attacks on mail carriers are increasing, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says, blaming the increase on warmer weather than usual and on people keeping larger dogs. Hot weather makes dogs irritable and attacks on mailmen were up by 40 percent in the first six months of this year, the Post Office said. A survey of the problem in the current long hot summer by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported a mail carrier in <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> was bitten on the arm when a dog leaped through the window of his delivery van. In <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, a mail carrier had a narrow escape when a guard dog inside a house crashed through the glass front door to try to get him. There were 7,057 dog attacks on mail carriers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last year, nearly one-fifth more than in 1987. Dog attacks cost the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> $ 515,000 a year. To stop them, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is testing a device that emits a high-pitched sound inaudible to humans but intimidating to dogs. In the past, mail carriers facing a threatening dog were advised to get down on all fours and look the beast straight in the eye. Few were brave enough to try, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Snake Stunt Called Off After Public Outcry</HEAD>

 Live snakes sent to video rental shop owners to promote a horror film will be retrieved and the stunt will be canceled because of public outcry, the organizers said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which began sending out 700 Chinese rat snakes to shops nationwide last week as part of a promotional package, said it was worried about the reptiles. `` We were worried that all this unwarranted attention could get the public overly interested in the snakes, and result in them coming to harm,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>, the company's marketing manager. `` We thought the best thing to do was to take them back.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had a different view on what might cause the snakes harm. It said last week that directions accompanying the snakes had incorrectly said they did n't need to be fed during what Cinema International planned as the snakes' month-long stay in the shops. But an <ORGANIZATION> RSPCA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Tuesday it welcomed the end of the promotion, saying `` obviously <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> has seen the error of their ways, and we're very pleased about that.'' The spokeswoman said it would prosecute the company if any of the snakes suffered. The snakes, which were not poisonous, were sent out to promote the release of the video of the film `` The Serpent and the Rainbow.''

<HEAD>EPA Says Arizona Plant Pollutes Grand Canyon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> concluded today that emissions from a massive coal-fired power plant in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> cause up to 70 percent of the air pollution over the Grand Canyon and must be curbed. In announcing its preliminary findings, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it expects a final decision by next February on how pollution from the Navajo Generating Station is to be curbed. Operators of the Page, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, plant about 12 miles from the northern rim of the canyon have argued that no additional pollution curbs should be required because much of the canyon pollution comes from other sources in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tests, using a chemical tracer that was released through the power plant's 750-foot smokestacks, demonstrated that on average about 40 percent of the pollution over the Grand Canyon originates with the plant and during some periods the percentage is as high as 70 percent. Officials said a solution may require the plant to install expensive `` scrubber'' technology to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which currently range as high as 12 to 13 tons an hour during peak power periods. The 2,250-megawatt power plant, partially owned by the federal government, has been under close scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to determine to what extent it contributes to the bright, white layers of haze clearly visible over the canyon during much of the year, especially in winter. `` We have substantial evidence that the Navajo Generating Station is a significant contributor to the visiblity problem,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator. `` Action must be taken now to protect the Grand Canyon.'' The plant is one of the largest coal-burning electric generating facilities in the country, burning 24,000 tons of coal a day. Because of the plant's size, sulfur dioxide emissions are a problem even though it burns largely low-sulfur coal. The federal government could be required to pay for some of the pollution control equipment because the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> holds a 24 percent interest in the facility. The government uses electricity from the plant to pump water from the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for irrigation in central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> action was prompted by a lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a private group.

No one was injured in the March hijacking of the <ORGANIZATION> Malev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet, but <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> juvenile court judge <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirszoweit </PERSON> said the teen-agers had put passengers' lives in danger. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Macicko </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Styck </PERSON>, 16, said they seized the plane because they wanted asylum in the West. Armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle, they grabbed a hostage at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ruzyne </LOCATION> airport on March 29 and forced their way onto the Soviet-built Tupolev-154 plane, firing a single shot into the air. After releasing 82 passengers, including all the women and children, they forced the plane to fly to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with 11 remaining passengers and a crew of four. They surrendered peacefully at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, where the plane had been scheduled to fly, three hours after the hijacking began. They confessed to authorities, and there was no trial. The court said the teen-agers would be transferred to a youth home in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state, where they will be allowed to attend school while serving the probation. Shortly after the hijacking, Czechoslovak authorities requested extradiction of the teen-agers, but West German officials decided to prosecute them in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> instead.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrapped up a strategy session today with top Cabinet officials on a new anti-drug policy and promised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do all it can to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> fight its violent drug cartels. `` We will cooperate with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the best of our ability,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters outside his oceanfront vacation home, adding that the administration supports `` what the president of that country is trying to do.'' Asked about Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s televised appeal to drug users abroad to stop using narcotics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I fully agree with that. So does our drug czar, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. ... We talked about that at lunch.'' The president said `` we did have a very good discussion on the anti-narcotics program. We'll have more to say on that next week.'' White House officials have said the anti-drug plan, to be revealed Sept. 5 in a televised presidential address to the nation, will cost around $ 8 billion _ $ 2 billion above current anti-drug spending levels. It will attempt to cut off drugs at the source, stiffen penalties for users and expand treatment for addicts, they said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he planned to increase economic aid to foreign countries as part of his anti-drug package in view of the violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He declined to answer directly, saying `` We'll have more to say on that at the appropriate time, which will be fairly soon.'' Joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at his oceanfront vacation home were <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> drug policy director; Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>; Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. At a news briefing later, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` The focus of the meeting was on the international aspects'' of the anti-drug strategy, with particular emphasis on the situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The administration had initially been considering $ 300 million in economic and military aid to the Andean countries, including <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said that figure has already been raised by the $ 65 million package of assistance for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that the White House announced last Friday. `` There will be, I think it's fair to say, a greater military role in the future with respect to the drug program than has been true in the past,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in a television interview before the meeting. Asked on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' what kind of military role he envisioned in the expanded fight, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, `` We'll let the president worry about that next week.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said she was requesting $ 19 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to purchase armored cars, bulletproof vests, metal detectors for court houses and other security devices to protect her country's judges, under seige by the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. `` The law is under siege in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and we must protect it every way we can,'' she told a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Asked about the aid request, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not discuss it specifically, but said, `` It's being worked out now, the details.'' The aid package being sought is in addition to the $ 5 million that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has approved over a two-year period to improve security for judges and the $ 65 million in military aid announced last week. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was in the process of drafting extradition requests for 12 Colombian drug traffickers under federal indictment. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, put to rest rumors that Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> had decided to resign in the face of death threats from drug cartel leaders worried about possible extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every trafficker sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face trial. On his daily golf outing Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to comment on a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> report that he had approved a covert action in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> against the drug lords. `` If I discussed covert action, it would n't be covert and I do n't discuss that kind of thing at all anyway,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday got a firsthand report from Secretary of Labor <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on their visits in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> with the new leadership of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it could take `` a lot more money'' than his $ 119 million aid package to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> rebuild its economy. `` But it's also got to take political reform,'' the president said. `` It's got to take economic reform so that when they talk about investment and privatization, something really happens.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for being `` extraordinarily understanding'' of the changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said he hopes peaceful change would continue `` not only outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but in it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> last month, said that if the Solidarity leader visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later this year, `` I certainly will'' meet with him.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> today vowed to continue to fight her country's drug lords despite death threats, and she appealed for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to protect judges. `` The law is under siege in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and we must protect it every way we can,'' she told a news conference at the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> embassy. She disputed reports that she had considered resigning in the face of death threats against her, her husband and the couple's 3-year-old son `` I never considered resigning,'' she said. `` The threats are out there, but I am satisfied with my protection right now.'' Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said she would remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> through Sept. 6 to continue discussions with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials about her requests for additional aid to protect Colombian judges from assassination. The 32-year-old justice minister said she was requesting $ 19 million to purchase armored cars, bulletproof vests, metal detectors for court houses and other security devices to protect the jurists. The aid package being sought is in addition to the $ 5 million that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has approved over a two-year period to improve security for judges. The president also has approved $ 65 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to help the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government fight the drug cartels. At his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he met with top aides on the anti-drug battle plan he will unveil Sept. 5, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was noncommittal when asked about the requested $ 19 million in aid to protect judges. He first declined comment, then said, `` It's being worked out now, the details.'' And he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will cooperate with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the best of our ability.'' Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said she was anxious to continue her efforts to preserve the Colombian legal system. She said her government faced a fight with a foe that has `` no respect for the law or even the minimal standards of decency.'' But she expressed confidence that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> `` will survive this crisis.'' She said she was `` very pleased'' with the response of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, saying she still was hoping for more assistance. Meanwhile, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, backed away from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier prediction that a Colombian drug trafficker wanted in this country would be extradited this week. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> may not be extradited for two weeks under procedures set forth by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. He also raised the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which overturned the extradition procedures in 1987, may review the emergency decrees for extradition that recently were promulgated by Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. `` Those extradition procedures are complicated, and I think there is a possibility there may be a decision to have the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> rule on those new procedures,'' the spokesman said. Nevertheless, he said, `` we have every hope and expectation of getting custody of Mr. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was in the process of drafting extradition requests for 12 other Colombian drug traffickers under federal indictment.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Fears Force Educators to Change School Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Educators are canceling or curtailing school activities such as shop classes, cheerleading and gymnastics to avoid lawsuits and high insurance premiums, a group backing revised liability laws said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> released results of two surveys that association President <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said `` illustrate just how much <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s litigiousness and risk-aversion has diminished the quality of life for all our students.'' But the head of a trial lawyers group challenged the surveys as being insurance industry-supported scare tactics. `` I think this is a red herring,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taglieri </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said the tort reform group has the backing of the insurance industry that wants to avoid paying out claims while `` reaping incredible profits'' from exorbitant premiums. <PERSON> Taglieri </PERSON> said the ploy of the insurance industry is to `` pressure the public into thinking there is a crisis in tort law.'' According to the surveys of attorneys and school principals, the threat of lawsuits is prompting educators to cancel class trips, shop classes and athletic activities, particularly gymnatistics, football and cheerleading. Other affected school programs include laboratory science programs, such as chemistry, and use of school playgrounds. Those who do n't are paying the price _ in the form of higher insurance payments, said <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluckman </PERSON>, staff counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` <ORGANIZATION> ATRA </ORGANIZATION> has an axe to grind,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. The reform group's purpose was to slant the questions in the surveys to `` get these results'' that were based more on `` gut feelings and attitudes rather than'' facts, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said `` Reduced activity is not necessarily bad, depending on the risks and exposure,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> added. `` If things are too risky -LRB- and canceled -RRB-, then it's actually a benefit, not a degradation of the educational system.'' The 190 principals who responded to the survey, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>, said that while only 16 class-related programs were canceled, about half of more than 240 activities were modified because lawsuits were either threatened or filed, said <PERSON> Gluckman </PERSON>. Fifty-eight percent of the responding principals said there was a noticeable difference in the kinds of school programs being offered because of the threat of lawsuits and high insurance costs, <PERSON> Gluckman </PERSON> said. The survey, conducted last December, showed 51 extracurricular programs were canceled and 301 modified. Restrictions on athletics have included limits on heights of pyramids by cheerleaders, stopping the use of trampolines by gymnasts and halting diving competitions for swimmers, the association said. Sixty-two percent of the attorneys representing school boards that are members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported no changes in school activities. However, most indicated that schools are paying higher insurance premiums to continue offering the programs. One in five attorneys said they had been involved in lawsuits or out-of-court settlements that affected school-related programs. About 290 members of the <ORGANIZATION> NSBA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> completed the survey. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is a Washington-based organization that advocates revising the system of liability lawsuits.

 A sheriff today said he doubted a wounded, handcuffed Canadian fugitive who was strapped to a stretcher could have caused the wreck of a medical helicopter that killed all four aboard. The bodies of Canadian fugitive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 25, and three crew members were found by searchers Monday in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Larch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>, the sheriff of <LOCATION> Bonner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said today that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' body was still strapped to a gurney at the legs and both elbows, and one arm was cuffed to the stretcher. That meant he had only partial mobility in the lower portion of the other arm, where a nurse had rigged an intravenous tube, <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said. `` I really start to doubt any suspect activity that could have been instrumental'' in the crash, <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> were dispatched to the site, authorities said today. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> of Eagle Helicopter, which provides pilots, mechanics and the medical helicopter to Sacred Heart Medical Center, said he and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials were also heading to the scene. <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said other factors, such as mechanical failure or bad weather, more likely contributed to the crash. A storm had passed over northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> on Sunday night, when the chopper went down. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinkgraf </PERSON>, who was listening to a scanner at his home in <LOCATION> Colbert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said the crew _ the pilot, a registered nurse and a respiratory therapist _ reported that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was scuffling before the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astar </ORGANIZATION> from Sacred Heart hospital in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> crashed around 10 p.m. Sunday, He said the crew `` reported they were having problems with the suspect.'' `` A couple of minutes later, they reported they were in a scuffle with the suspect. Then we heard the hospital trying to get in touch with them. They reported they lost contact with the helicopter,'' <PERSON> Zinkgraf </PERSON> said. However, a medical center spokesman, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thordarson </PERSON>, said the last report at 9:56 p.m. made no mention of any difficulty, and that only static and background noises were heard afterward. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was not monitoring the radio transmissions. Sheriff's Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said the pilot was frantic in his last radio transmission. `` He said something like, ` We have a problem. We are going down,''' <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said it appeared the craft broke apart in mid-air at high altitude, since there was little damage to trees and wreckage was strewn over a wide area. `` It really could have been anything. All we know is that whatever happened must have caught the pilot by surprise. He went straight down from a high altitude,'' he said. `` It just does n't seem likely to us, and hearing some comments from the feds yesterday, that the likelihood of patient involvement was that high.'' Earlier Sunday night, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> apparently overpowered a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally near a Customs station in <LOCATION> Eastport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boundary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. He broke into a nearby home, and, in an exchange of gunfire, was shot in the chest by a <LOCATION> Boundary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, man, police said. The homeowner, 71-year-old <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlocklin </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> were taken to the medical center in separate flights. <PERSON> McGlocklin </PERSON> was in satisfactory condition with wounds to his right arm and back, the medical center said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bridgefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, was wanted in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for investigation of escape, sexual assault and auto theft charges. Boundary County Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON> said he had volunteered to travel in the helicopter with <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, but the flight crew said the additional passenger would be too much weight, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is conducting the preliminary investigation. `` If it turns out there was activity aboard the aircraft that contributed to or caused the accident _ and there is speculation about the prisoner having a tussle with flight crew _ it would be referred to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as a criminal matter,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of the regional <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The crew included pilot <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Varea </PERSON>, age unknown; <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, 31, a registered nurse; and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Siekerman </PERSON>, 36, a respiratory therapist. All three were from <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Thordarson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>`Ice Curtain' Thawing Fast Between Alaska and the Soviet Far East</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With more than a score of trade, cultural and scientific agreements in the works, the political `` Ice Curtain'' is melting fast between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Still, Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, who leaves Wednesday on a 10-day, 6,700-mile `` trade and friendship mission'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, counsels patience. `` I think they perceive a clear advantage in perestroika and glasnost _ the liberalizing of their political and economic system,'' the governor said. `` But many of these changes will be taken over a longer time frame, because change is inherently unstable.'' The political thaw has led to so many agreements between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that even <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> has trouble keeping up with them. He recently asked that any initiatives across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> be coordinated through his office. `` The main purpose was that a lot of people were coming out of the woodwork purporting to be representatives of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramseur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>'s press secretary. `` Things are happening so fast that we wanted to get a handle on it.'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> `` ca n't sign treaties or agreements that bind nations,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` What we can do is enter into preliminary negotiations, sort out the details at our level, then hand them to the representatives of the respective federal governments for a ready-made treaty. At a 1987 summit in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued a statement encouraging cooperation on issues relating to the Arctic. Many Alaska-Soviet ties have been forged since then, including: _ A `` Friendship Flight'' from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> in 1988 reunited Eskimos separated since the political `` Ice Curtain'' was drawn in 1948. A small commuter airline began charter service between the two cities a year later. _ A Soviet icebreaker helped rescue whales trapped in ice off <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> in 1988, and a Soviet skimmer ship helped mop up after the nation's worst oil spill hit Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in March. _ An expedition used skis and sled dogs to make a 1,200-mile from <LOCATION> Anadyr </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> earlier this year to promote Alaska-Soviet relations. A pact opening the Alaska-Soviet border to visa-free travel by <PERSON> Eskimos </PERSON> with relatives in both countries is to be signed in September. Negotiations are under way that could lead to an agreement to protect fishing grounds from overfishing. Both nations also are working to establish joint sea rescue missions in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. `` Because of our geographical location and our history in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, we were in a much better position than other states to press for agreements relating to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` As a result, we're recognized now as being in the forefront of efforts leading to friendship between the two nations.''

<HEAD>GNP Surges, Economic Fears Eased</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a healthy 2.7 percent annual rate in the spring, far higher than previously estimated, the government said Tuesday in a report viewed as further evidence that the country's longest peacetime expansion is in no danger of faltering. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the increase in the gross national product from April through June was a full percentage point higher than the anemic 1.7 percent GNP increase originally estimated a month ago. Most of the new-found strength came in consumer spending, a critical sector because it accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. Government spending, business investment and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales also provided momentum during the spring. The GNP report showed that while inflation picked up in the second quarter, the increase was not quite as bad as previously believed. A price guage tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent from April through June because of higher energy costs. A month ago, this increase had been put at 5.2 percent. In further good news for the economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that sales of new homes, bolstered by falling mortgage rates, shot up 14.4 percent in July, their biggest monthly gain in almost three years. With the strength in home sales, which had been one of the weakest sectors of the economy, analysts said they expected respectable growth in the final half of the year in line with the forecast being made by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. This is a far different view than the one prevalent just a month ago when the initial GNP report put growth at such a sluggish rate that many analysts expressed fears that the country was on the verge of its first recession since the 1981-82 downturn. Since that time, however, various reports have shown that business activity in the spring was not as sluggish as previously believed. `` We have had almost a total rewriting of history,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Instead of the entrenched slowdown suggested by the original data, we now have a story of a very solid economy that was picking up momentum in the second quarter.'' In the first three months of the year, the GNP grew at a 3.7 percent rate, but most of that increase included a one-time boost that resulted from returning anticipated farm output this year to its pre-drought levels. Without that increase, non-farm GNP rose at a weak 1.5 percent rate in the first three months of the year. Analysts have been busy revising upward their growth forecasts with some approaching the administration's own projection that the economy will turn in a respectable 2.9 percent increase in 1989, compared to a four-year high of 4.4 percent in 1984. `` This economy is not headed into a recession,'' said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, we are doing better for the seventh year of an economic expansion than we had any reason to hope for.'' To reach the administration's growth target, the economy will have to expand at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent in the second half of the year. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said GNP growth could rise to around 3 percent in the current July-September quarter, but other analysts said they were looking for slightly slower growth because of a need to work down inventories of unsold goods in such sectors as autos. White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> two weeks ago criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that if a downturn does occur it will be the fault of the central bank for keeping interest rates too high. But analysts said there was little likelihood now that the central bank will lower rates any time soon, given the robust economic growth and the fact that inflationary pressures have abated somewhat but not disappeared. In another report, the government said that corporations' profits after taxes fell a sharp 5.4 percent in the second quarter, the biggest setback in three years and a reflection of rising business costs, analysts said. The GNP report showed that consumer spending advanced in the second quarter at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, double the original estimate. Government purchases jumped by 12.3 percent while business investment spending climbed by 8.2 percent. The trade deficit as measured by the GNP declined by $ 2.5 billion, slightly better than the original estimate. The weakest sector in the GNP report was housing, which suffered a 12.6 percent drop in construction in the spring, the worst setback since 1982. But analysts noted the big jump in new homes sales in July and said this should spur construction increases in the months ahead. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at $ 4.134 trillion in the second quarter.

 Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> says President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, optimistic that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist government can be removed through free elections, favors continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels until they can be resettled peacefully. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> also said he believes the profits of drug production and distribution in nations such as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are so enormous that the supply of narcotics probably can not be shut off until demand for cocaine and other drugs in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> is dramatically reduced. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Republican, a ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, commented at a news conference as he reviewed his impressions of a 14-day, nine-nation trip through <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Reporting on his visit to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said: `` President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told me he favors continuation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the Contras through the Nicaraguan elections -LRB- next February -RRB- and perhaps after that.'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said that when family members are taken into consideration, some 60,000 to 70,000 people are either Contra members or closely associated with them. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> believes that re-integrating so large a group into Nicaraguan society or settling them elsewhere will be difficult and time consuming and that they will have to be supported until their future is secured, <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> `` believes the majority of them will be integrated, but it will be difficult,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> noted that the agreement reached earlier this year by the presidents of five Central American nations calling for the disbanding of the Contras by December is purely voluntary on the part of the rebels. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the principal architect of the accord, also stressed the need for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to go into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to boost voter confidence that the February elections will be held and that a non-Sandinista president can be elected president, <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` He said polls taken by Costa Ricans in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> show that a unified opposition would defeat'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, `` and he is optimistic that could happen,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` The Nicaraguans have to get over a psychic block that leads them to believe that either nothing will happen or that elections will not make a difference,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> added. He said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> hopes to give the process a boost at an international conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> in October marking the 100th anniversary of democracy in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, noting that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to attend. The five Central American presidents will meet in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital, in December. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> hopes that also will help promote the elections process, <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said he found the narcotics situation in countries such as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> difficult, complicated and `` truly depressing.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials estimate that 450 square miles of Peruvian farm land is in coca production with Peruvian officials estimating the total as twice that. Coca paste is the basic ingrediant of cocaine and <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said it is hard to imagine what crops could be substituted that would bring in a quarter of the narcotics profits now being pumped into the inflation-ravaged Peruvian economy. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said it is essential the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strengthen a government that is under siege by narcotics cartels in the aftermath of the assassination of a leading presidential candidate. Eradicating the flow of narcotics into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> depends on drying up demand among Americans using drugs, <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` We should be discouraging first users and casual users and rehabilitating addicts,'' he said.

 Distribution of $ 65 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s war on drug traffickers awaits a detailed list of needs from that government, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` When the list is returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delivery will begin,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said at a routine Pentagon news briefing. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last Friday granted the aid package of aircraft, boats, arms and ammunition to work with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to `` bring to justice those responsible for the scourge of drug trafficking.'' An unprecedented crackdown is underway in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> following the recent murder of a presidential candidate. Drug traffickers declared `` total and absolute war'' on the government, and on Tuesday set off seven bombs, according to police. Police also blamed traffickers Sunday for nine bombings of banks in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. There were no claims of responsibility. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> a list of equipment available for immediate transfer from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stocks after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> granted the aid. The Colombians, in turn, issued their list of requests. `` Officials of both governments are now analyzing those needs,'' the spokeksman said, adding, `` The <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> is ready to provide immediate airlift.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> declined to say what type of equipment would be provided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons, ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medical supplies. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in announcing the aid package last Friday, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> helicopters for transporting troops, equipment and ammunitions, Blackhawk helicopters for medical evacuations, planes, trucks and assault boats. The package also is to include American military advisers, which <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said would be ` relatively small.'' He said the soldiers would not assume combat roles. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the American personnel would be used to train the Colombians in how to operate the equipment. He said the goods would not be delivered until the entire list was received and approved, which he added could be this week.

 Space shuttle Atlantis was rolled to the launch pad Tuesday for a mission that will send the plutonium-fueled <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on a six-year flight to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Jupiter. The rollout allows plenty of time to ready Atlantis for liftoff Oct. 12, said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, who directs shuttle preparation. Oct. 12 is the start of a 43-day period in which <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> will be in position to receive a probe from Earth in 1995. <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe would be put in the payload bay on Wednesday. Five astronauts will deploy <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> about six hours after launch, starting it on a journey during which it is to fly by <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, pass <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice and make the first close approach to an asteroid. The circuitous 2.4-million-mile route was chosen so <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> can use the gravitational pull of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to accelerate it slingshot-fashion toward Jupiter. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is to parachute a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere and then spend about two years orbiting the planet, photographing it and studying it with scientific instruments. To power it through its long journey, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will carry two 122-pound nuclear generators. Anti-nuclear groups have protested that the nuclear material could pose a hazard if it were released during an accident, although no protesters were at the rollout. `` If people really understood what we're doing here, the significance of it, the risks we are taking, and the precautions we are putting into place, there really should be no concern,'' <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said that the generators were tested to survive the most explosive type of shuttle failure and that a plutonium release would be unlikely to hurt anyone in any case.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was first in the Nielsen TV ratings, but another working class housewife, <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in `` Married ...

The show got a 13.4 rating, its highest ever, and was first in its time period Sunday for the second time this summer. The Fox comedy was the only original show, other than <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20,'' in the 30 top shows for the week <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s fledging fourth network has made its first ratings breakthrough in recent months with its shows rising out of the ratings cellar for the first time. Shows such as `` Married ...

<HEAD>Moldavian Lawmakers Win First Battle on Language Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KISHINEV, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moldavian lawmakers trying to make their language the official tongue of the southern republic overwhelmingly won their first test of strength Tuesday, stopping a bid to halt legislative debate. The republic's legislature voted 300-43 to proceed with the bill, despite objections by deputies from two cities where 80,000 mostly Russian workers have been on strike since last week in protest, saying it would be the first step of a policy of discrimination. Three deputies abstained and 30 were absent. The strikes have affected more than 100 factories and enterprises in at least three cities in the republic that borders <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. A key opponent of the bill said the vote to proceed with legislative debate portends likely approval in the next few days. `` I think the law will be adopted, the bill will pass,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solonar </PERSON>, a historian and a leader of <LOCATION> Yedinstvo </LOCATION>, a Russian-language group. He said his group will try to amend it. <PERSON> Solonar </PERSON> warned that `` life wo n't be quiet'' if the bill passes. `` I know the situation is very dangerous, and in the future this tension will not disappear,'' he said. The bill would make Moldavian, which is nearly identical to Romanian, the official language. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> currently has no law defining an official language, but <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> is commonly used in government, factories and commerce. Opponents of the bill want to see both Moldavian and Russian named official languages. Yedinstvo is seeking amendments allowing business managers to choose the language of their official documents, essentially gutting a key portion of the law. The bill also would make Moldavian the language of communication between Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Bulgarians and other nationalities in the republic. That goes further than the language laws in other Soviet republics. Many non-Moldavians do n't speak Moldavian, but they share some knowledge of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda criticized that part of the bill Tuesday. The bill's opponents say that will force even predominantly non-Moldavian residents to use Moldavian. The labor newspaper Trud attacked Moldavian nationalists, saying they `` stepped up bitterness, mutual hostility and suspicion'' among ethnic groups. The law also would restore the Latin alphabet, replacing the Cyrillic imposed by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> after he annexed <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed the Cyrillic alphabet to back up his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities. Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's 4.2 million people. Tensions between the Moldavians and non-Moldavians have been running high since the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a primarily Moldavian group, began organizing this year to push the language law and other demands for more autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> won the first battle when the legislature convened and defeated an effort by deputies representing the strikers to delay the session for months, well after a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting on ethnic issues expected in early September. <PERSON> Mihai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghimpu </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said about 50 deputies opposed the bill. Other People's Front sources said there may be as many as 100 votes against it. The law requires a two-thirds vote of all deputies who are registered for the session. If Tuesday's registration does not change, the opponents will need 116 of 346 votes to defeat it. `` We have to seize the moment,'' said <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> <PERSON> Myndycanu </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> governing council. `` We have to solve our problems before <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> does.'' <PERSON> Leonida </PERSON> <PERSON> Lari </PERSON>, a Moldavian poet and lawmaker, said in an interview: `` The people are patient but they've been pushed to the edge, they've been held back too long.'' Speeches at the session, which was televised live in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, overwhelmingly favored the language law. During the session, police surrounded the legislative building, which flew the flag of the Moldavian Soviet republic, a red banner with a green horizontal stripe and a hammer and sickle. On a nearby square, hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> supporters gathered beneath the blue, yellow and red of the traditional Moldavian flag. After the debate ended, the crowd swelled to several thousand people and swarmed around about 100 people who marched past a statue of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and shouted slogans against the strikers. In the Baltic republics, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials accepted a stinging rebuke against nationalist activists that was issued Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But four Lithuanian legislators sent a telegram to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> saying the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> statement showed a `` dictatorship'' still rules. They also said the statement was `` anti-constitutional ... directed against the self-determination for the peoples of the republics,'' according to <PERSON> Arunas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabriunas </PERSON>, a leader of the Lithuanian grassroots movement Sajudis. <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, the party chief in the republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, said the party agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment that the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> were in danger of falling into `` an abyss'' if they heeded separatist calls for secession, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Tarmu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tammerk </PERSON>, editor of the Estonian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Kodumaa </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone that <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> also criticized `` destabilizing groups of different kinds,'' including those calling for secession and restoration of the `` bourgeois order.'' That was a reference to the independent government that ruled <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> between the two world wars. <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> said the republic wanted more local control, but `` <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> is part and parcel of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a sovereign republic.'' However, he also said he believed firmly in `` the self-determination of nations on the basis of democratic legal guarantees.'' The government of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of a second <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, came into line Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party ruled out secession, saying, `` It is possible to be a free and sovereign nation within a union of equal republics.'' Lithuanian activists said Monday that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the republic had gone too far in its drive for independence. On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic people joined hands in a human chain protesting the 1939 agreement between <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> that assigned the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> to a Soviet sphere of influence.

However, the new Cabinet contains more technocrats, many of them Western-educated, than revolutionary ideologues. The appointments reflect <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s pledge to focus on raising living standards and boost private enterprise after a decade of strict state controls on the economy. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> had come under fire from radicals for dumping their leaders from his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. They included outgoing Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who has been closely linked with Shiite Moslem militants holding most of the Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The endorsements came after <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, a member of the radical faction opposed to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s pragmatists, gave the Cabinet list his personal backing at the last minute. `` I see Mr. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s Cabinet as a successful one and one that suports the deprived ... and whose members have worked for the -LRB- 1979 Islamic -RRB- revolution,'' <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>'s support was seen as critical for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was elected president July 28 and handed broadened executive powers. The Cabinet approval indicated the radicals were prepared to follow spiritual leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s call for an end to political bickering. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> became the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s supreme leader after the death June 3 of revolutionary partriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as speaker, also said the new ministers would face tough scrutiny in the chamber, where radical factions have dominated since parliamentary elections last year. `` Our hands will not be tied if a minister gets the vote,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaking before the vote, called for more government efficiency, noting that in the past `` only 50 or 60 percent of programs'' passed in parliament had actually been implemented. He said ministers' programs must include an annual budget that would need parliamentary approval. He defended his Cabinet's political credentials but stressed the emphasis was placed on finding good managers `` because we are in the reconstruction phase and ... right now we have to put more effort into ensuring the programs are implemented.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is seeking to rebuild industry after an eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It also hopes to boost productivity afer years of economic mismanagement by revolutionary radicals. <PERSON> Rafsanajni </PERSON> also is expected to gradually revive links with the West to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation and attract foreign investment. A key figure in restoring foreign relations will be Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, 44, a U.S.-trained pediatrician who helped negotiate the cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that took effect in August 1988. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was one of 14 ministers who received more than 200 votes in parliament. Others were Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>, 41, and and Interior Minister <PERSON> Abdollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON>, 39, a former leader of the Revolutionary Guards.

<TEXT>
 New Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> travels to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a summit Japanese officials hope will forge closer contacts and cool simmering trade tensions. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who took office Aug. 9, will not bring major trade or diplomatic initiatives to his discussions with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a senior Foreign Ministry official said. He does plan, however, to use <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, baseball and talks with academicians to seek closer ties with Americans to ease tension over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s growing economic might, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> wanted at the earliest possible occasion to make a personal approach to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, not only for bilateral relations, but in a global context as well,'' the official said. `` It is extremely important to have a personal relationship so that both sides can pick up the phone when important problems crop up,'' he said. The 58-year-old prime minister also will appeal to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public in several major speeches and visit <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> game. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will address scholars and journalists as part of his effort to appeal directly to people who influence <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public opinion and policy. Recent surveys have indicated growing resentment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over Japanese investment in American real estate and over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which was $ 55 billion in 1988, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to seek a commitment from <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will broaden foreign access to Japanese business and distribution systems. U.S.-Japanese talks on non-tariff trade barriers are scheduled to begin Sept. 4, but <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is under strong pressure at home not to make additional concessions on trade. The senior official said <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> viewed his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit as an opportunity to explain exactly what <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has already done to help ease the trade deficit. `` What we have done is considerable, given the very fact that we have changed our economic structure from one visibly dependent on exports to one dependent on the domestic economy,'' he said. `` It will take a long time to solve the trade imbalance and in the meantime we have to live with it,'' the official said. `` To defuse the tension caused by the imbalance, we need a more objective understanding of each other.'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday that <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> also would reassure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other American officials of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s overall political stability. Japanese foreign policy initiatives have been on hold for several months as the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> grappled with a series of money and sex scandals and an election setback that led to two prime ministers resigning. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third prime minister in three months. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will be making clear to the president that there will be no change whatsoever in our basic position in our foreign policy and he will continue to carry on the commitments made with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the American government,'' said <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> of the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> American Division. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> also will use the tour, which will take him to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Sept. 4-6 and to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Sept. 7, to establish his diplomatic credentials and enhance his stature at home, analysts say.

 Sales of new homes, bolstered by falling mortgage rates, surged 14.4 percent in July, the fastest pace in nearly three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The department said that new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 739,000 units last month, compared with a revised rate of 646,000 units in June. The advance was led by a giant 55.8 percent jump in sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, a region where sales have been especially sluggish because of high prices. But every geographic area of the country reported good gains during the month. Analysts credited the advance to a sharp decline in mortgage rates. After hitting a peak of 11.2 percent in March, fixed-rate mortgages had fallen to an average 9.81 percent nationwide by the end of July. Rates have risen slightly in recent weeks, currently averaging 10.21 percent, according to a national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Economists were split on whether this increase would continue or whether mortgage rates would begin to drift down again in coming months <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he looked for mortgage rates to continue creeping up, driven by reasonably strong economic growth and continued worries about inflationary pressures. But <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, predicted a resumption of modest rate declines and he said this would act to spur further gains in sales. The July increase was the third in the past four months and put sales at their highest level since December 1986, when homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 784,000 units. The 14.4 percent rise was the biggest advance since a 22.9 percent jump in September 1986. The report on new home sales followed a report last Friday that sales of existing homes also improved in July, rising by 1.2 percent to an annual rate of 3.40 million units, the second consecutive month that existing home sales have increased. The price of a new home posted a modest decline in July. The median new-home price fell 3.7 percent to $ 118,800. The median is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less. Some analysts said the price drop indicated that first-time buyers, who buy less expensive homes, are re-entering the market. But <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said he also believed that the decline reflected the fact that sellers were being forced to cut their asking prices, especially in such high-cost areas as the Northeast. The 55.8 percent jump in sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> was the biggest one-month advance for that region since February 1982. It put sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 120,000 units, 15.3 percent above where they were a year ago. Sales climbed 23.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 125,000 units, the highest level of activity for this region since February 1987. Sales in the West were up 8.9 percent to an annual rate of 232,000 units, while sales in the South rose by a more modest 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 261,000 units.

<HEAD>Conference Fails in Peace Bid, New Fighting Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international conference failed to formulate a peace plan for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> but will probably meet again next spring to resume its work, a spokesman said Tuesday. Delegates predicted a full-scale resumption of the guerrilla war, with the combatants also maintaining their political contacts. `` There is not at this stage the possibility for movement by any of the Cambodian factions,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gueguinou </PERSON>. The 19 countries at the month-long conference were to issue a brief declaration Wednesday at the closing ministerial session, he said, adding the conference was likely to resume in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> `` when conditions are right.'' <PERSON> Gueguinou </PERSON> said a likely time was next spring. The issues of national reconciliation among the warring factions and setting up a control mechanism to monitor a standdown were the biggest stumbling blocks, he said. A three-party resistance led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has been fighting the Vietnamese-installed government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> for a decade. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978, toppling the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from a nearly four-year reign of terror. The Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest element in the resistance, have been the central issue of contention. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s efforts to include the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in an interim government composed of all Cambodian factions to preside over the country before general elections. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has refused to exclude them from a share of power. The failure to reach a settlement at the conference means there will be no international supervision of a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to pull out its 26,000 troops by Sept. 27 even without a peace agreement. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has rejected any monitoring force under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which recognizes <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s coalition as legitimate government of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, conference co-chairmen, decided that compromise was impossible among the four Cambodian factions despite `` intensive consultations'' Tuesday, <PERSON> Gueguinou </PERSON> said. `` It was too early to reach a compromise but not too early to work,'' he said. When the conference resumes, `` it will start with considerable work behind it.'' It had been widely speculated that the conference would fail in its goal to reach a comprehensive settlement to the conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which has endured two decades of bloodshed and turmoil. `` We are deadlocked here because the military situation is not decisive,'' said a spokesman for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s delegation, <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> <PERSON> Saraywath </PERSON>. `` If there is no result on the battlefield, there is no result at the negotiating table.'' `` We may be moving into a period where ... things will go back to the ground, to the battlefield,'' a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, demanding he not be further identified. `` There may be a period now of some months of testing of the military balance on the ground.'' Reports of battlefield action have increased over the past three weeks. Western analysts attributed the renewed fighting to a jockeying for power before the resumption in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of the final ministerial session. `` <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> thinks he can still win the war. That is why he has made no concessions here,'' <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> said. `` When he sees that he is weak, he will negotiate.'' In three or four months, `` we'll see who has the advantage,'' he said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said there was `` great uncertainty'' about the real strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and that a period of military testing may determine who has the upper hand in any future negotiations. The official refused to comment on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could supply lethal aid to the resistance should fighting flare again. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been pressing for aid to the two non-communist elements of the resistance. `` We assume at the minimum there will be a very substantial supply of armaments'' by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s forces, he said.

<HEAD>New Attacks on Ousted Party Chief; Possible Prelude to Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official press broadened accusations Tuesday against ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, saying the reform-minded leader inspired attacks on government offices during the spring democracy movement. The new attacks by two newspapers were a possible prelude to prosecuting <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> in what would be the first trial of a party leader in nearly a decade. The newspapers said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was directly responsible for massive student marches, attacks on government offices and establishment of illegal groups during the democracy movement through neglect of political and ideological education. `` <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> ... proposed diluting the function of the party,'' said Economic Information. `` -LRB- He -RRB- denied the superior tradition of the party -LRB- and -RRB- canceled the work of political education.'' A commentary in the party newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> bolstered flagging protests in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province when he told a visiting delegation on May 4 that the government should open dialogue with the students. His comments, the paper said, resulted in daily marches of tens of thousands of people, the establishment of more than 60 illegal organizations, attacks on provincial offices and the disruption of a major international trade fair by thousands of students. Economic Information said students influenced by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> attacked the socialist system at a discussion session last year with education officials, and questioned the need for political education. The students called ideological workers `` glib talkers propagating dog philosophy,'' the paper said. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was stripped of his party posts in late June after losing a power struggle over handling of the seven-week democracy movement. He was accused then of splitting the party and supporting the protests. Since then, government officials have said the investigation into <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is continuing but have refused to say if the party charges will be turned into legal charges. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not been seen in public since late May, when he spoke tearfully to students occupying Tiananmen Square. Some unofficial reports say he is under house arrest, but government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> recently said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was leading a normal life. The media have carried sporadic criticism of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for weeks. But the recent attacks have been notable for their length, detail and specific references to damage <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> allegedly caused by his erroneous thinking and leadership, including leading `` vast numbers'' of people astray. The commentaries may be an effort to prepare the public for the first trial of a top party leader since the 1980 trial of the <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION>, the leaders of the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution. Economic Information said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> neglected ideological work and encouraged `` bourgeois-liberal,'' or Western, thought. A Worker's Daily commentary Saturday said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> elevated the role of entrepreneurs while belittling workers, who should be considered the force behind socialist modernization. Worker's Daily said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> missed the point of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reform policies of the past decade, which was to show the superiority of socialism. `` <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> often told some people that capitalism actually was better and our socialist system had problems,'' it said. A military assault on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> quashed the student demonstration, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.

 A couple claimed Illinois' biggest single-winner lottery jackpot _ $ 42 million _ and said Tuesday their priorities are a quiet vacation and some investments. `` Like everyone else, we'd mapped out what we'd do if we won,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>. `` But today I ca n't remember a single thing we talked about. My mind's a blank.'' <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, 50, and his wife, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, 38, claimed the jackpot from Saturday's Lotto drawing. They live in suburban Hometown with her three children. The Madigans will receive 20 annual payments of $ 2.1 million. `` It's really very frightening, but at the same time it's a lot of fun,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> said. The couple said they had n't given much thought to spending the money beyond plans to buy a new car, remodel their home and travel. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, a supervisor for a security company, plans to keep his job at least through the end of the year. Mrs. <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, a gift shop clerk, said she will quit to spend more time with her children. The state's biggest jackpot is $ 69.9 million, awarded in an April 15 drawing, but that prize was divided among four ticket holders. Illinois', biggest previous single-winner jackpot was $ 40 million, won in 1984.

 A Czechoslovak court Tuesday convicted a leading dissident of inciting rebellion and sentenced him to 20 months in prison, emigre and human rights sources said. The dissident, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, called the proceedings a political trial that violated his freedom of speech, an emigre source said on condition of anonymity. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Machourek </PERSON> immediately appealed the conviction, calling the proceedings unfair, according to the emigre source, as well as Charter 77 human rights activist <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>. They said they were citing reports from friends of <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> who attended the trial. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, 37, is a Charter 77 member who last year served as the group's spokesman. The trial was held at <LOCATION> Gottwaldov </LOCATION>, about 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> was tried in connection with a petition signed by more than 400 people calling for more religious and cultural freedom and the release of all political prisoners. The petition was sent late last year to the government, which made no response. One of the most active of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s dissidents, <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> has been detained several times this year and released after hunger strikes. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> initially was detained March 16 in a mass crackdown on dissent that also put playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other leading activists in jail. He was last detained Aug. 7. The emigre source said only five friends of <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> were allowed into the courtroom. Most of the 30 people attending were hired by the government to keep out <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> supporters, she said. Also present were representatives of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian embassies, she said. <PERSON> Machourek </PERSON> said the evidence presented should have been insufficent to reach a verdict, because none of the witnesses said <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> wrote the petition, according to the emigre source.

<TEXT>
 Despite the scandal enveloping the generic drug industry, consumer advocates and physicians on Tuesday reaffirmed their confidence in lower-priced clones of brand-name medicines. `` At the present time, there's no evidence that any generic drugs out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effectiveness,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a physician and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Although disclosures of fraud and corruption in the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division have tainted the agency's reputation and cast doubts about the industry, many say concerns about the safety of generic drugs are overblown `` What we've seen in the past few weeks is regrettable but I do n't think it reflects all generics and it really has n't changed my prescribing habits,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, a trustee of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who is also an interist at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> and a clinical pharmacologist. In the past month, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has initiated steps to withdraw from the market products manufactured by several generic drug companies, including two that have admitted wrongoing in the growing scandal. In the latest move, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it wants to remove from the market <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s generic version of Dyazide, a popular drug used to treat high blood pressure The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it found no evidence of fraud, and the <LOCATION> Copiague </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> said the problem stems from confusion over a clerical error in identifying samples used in safety tests. Last week, the agency said it wants to remove from the market three products made by Par Pharmaceuticals of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and 25 made by <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, N.Y. Par and a company executive have pleaded guilty to paying illegal gratuities to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> chemists, and <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> has admitted that it submitted false samples for safety tests. Also last week, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> expanded federal inspections of 11 generic drug makers to include the plants of 20 additional generic firms. The agency said it was `` a further effort by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to assure the public of both the safety and the efficacy of the generic-drug supply in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The concerns question the ability of generic products to work as effectively as the brand-name drug _ whether they are absorbed into the body at the same rate as the original drug. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, head of the <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> consumer health group, said these potency problems are rarely of any significance. In most cases, he pointed out, doctors prescribe the same dose of medicine to a 125-pound adult as to a 250-pound adult. `` For most drugs, there is a wide range over which the drug will be effective and safe,'' he said. `` This cuts through a lot of the extent to which people are overreacting to the problems that have been brought to light.'' While <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> defends the general safety and efficacy of generic drugs, he is sharply critical of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for `` creating an atmosphere of lawlessness'' with lax enforcement of the regulations governing drug approvals. He is more concerned about the safety of new brand-name drugs than generic compounds because `` the record shows that every major prescription drug disaster in this country is related to a newly marketed brand-name drug.'' Generic drugs, copies of brand-name medicines that are usually more expensive, have long been controversial, but have become well accepted by consumers and physicians. A third of all prescriptions written in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are filled with generic drugs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Generic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. While generics are seen by some as money-saving alternatives, others, including some brand-name companies, claim generics are less effective than their trade-name counterparts. `` Most physicians can tell you that there are certain situations in which they would insist on trade-name drugs,'' said <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. He said he referred to conditions such as congestive heart failure that are difficult to treat. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Molishever </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Generic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, noted that generic drugs `` have been subject to constant continuing scrutiny throughout their existance'' and that the results have shown generics to have `` an extraordinary record of safety and efficacy.''

 Syrian gunners shelled an oil tanker bound for a Christian port Tuesday and set it ablaze, killing seven crewmen and starting an artillery duel that took three more lives, police reported. They said the Maltese-flag Sunshield was hit at 2:30 a.m., seven miles off the Christian-held <LOCATION> Maameltein </LOCATION> area 11 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, while trying to run the Syrian artillery blockade under cover of darkness. It carried 550,000 gallons of gasoline. <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Garabedian </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> captain, was among the dead; coast guard vessels rescued two wounded crew members; two others were missing and feared dead, the police reported. They said the seven badly burned bodies washed ashore several hours after the tanker was hit. Police reported three people killed and 16 wounded in the ensuing five-hour artillery exchange between Syrian army gunners and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units led by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Three of the wounded were Moslem firemen hit when an 82mm mortar round exploded in the parking lot of a west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> fire station. At least 802 people have been killed and 2,268 wounded, nearly all of them civilians, since fighting began March 8 between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s men and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> A police spokesman said the Sunshield was hit by at least one shell from radar-controlled Syrian howitzers deployed along the seafront in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Saddiq </PERSON>, 24, said at a hospital in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> the tanker was set ablaze by missiles fired from a Syrian gunboat that intercepted it. `` The Syrian captain ordered us through a bullhorn to identify ourselves and our cargo. Our captain did not reply,'' said <PERSON> Saddiq </PERSON>, who was being treated for severe burns. `` All our crew were hiding behind sandbags placed on the bridge to protect us from Syrian shelling. The Syrian gunboat sailed away and then fired several missiles that hit the bridge, starting the fire.'' If <PERSON> Saddiq </PERSON>'s report is correct, it would be the first time a Syrian warship fired on a cargo vessel since the fighting began nearly six months ago. They usually order intercepted ships to turn back. Police insisted the Sunshield was hit by artillery fire from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> directed by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> radars in mountains overlooking the coast. `` What probably happened is that the gunboat pulled away, as they usually do, leaving it to be hit by shellfire,'' said the police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules. He said the radar-controlled howitzers opened fire soon after the tanker entered Lebanese waters. A tug managed to tow the stricken ship to within a half-mile of the coast and firemen extinguished the blaze 12 hours after it hegan, the police said. A security source said privately the Christians might be trying to blame the attack on a Syrian gunboat in hopes of getting French naval protection for blockade runners. The tanker attack coincided with a visit by French envoy <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> for talks with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem leaders on how to end one of the worst episodes in a 14-year-old sectarian civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people. Syrian soldiers are in the country under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after the war began. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls them an occupation force and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which governed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by mandate until 1943, has a six-ship flotilla in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. It says the warships are on a humanitarian mission to evacuate the 7,000 French citizens in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if necessary. After the Sunshield was hit, police said, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 155mm howitzers opened fire on Syrian artillery positions in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to `` cover coast guard boats trying to rescue the tanker.'' Syrian gunners responded and shells began falling on Christian and Moslem neighborhoods. Seven other cargo ships trying to reach Christian ports have been hit by Syrian gunfire since March 16. At least two seamen have been killed. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from two days of talks with Syrian leaders in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. He met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> for three hours Tuesday in the general's bunker under the presidential palace at <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, a Christian suburb, and told reporters: He later crossed the sectarian dividing line for meetings with Moslem leaders, including acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, head of a Moslem cabinet that competes for authority with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>'s plan includes a cease-fire, embargo on arms deliveries to warring factions, political reforms to distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems, and withdrawal of foreign forces.

 Two Hungarians were fined and expelled from the country Tuesday for their part in an anti-government demonstration on the anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gyorgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerenyi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> were found guilty of breach of public order and fined $ 500 each, witnesses said. Western reporters were not admitted into the proceedings at <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerenyi </PERSON> had been in detention since they were arrested by plainclothes police on <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s central Wenceslas Square Aug. 21. They had gathered a crowd of people around them and were protesting the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. `` Bolsheviks came with tanks, we came with flowers,'' read their banner rejecting Hungarian participation in the invasion. <PERSON> Kerenyi </PERSON> delivered an emotional speech demanding liberal reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> similar to those underway in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The crowd applauded, shouted `` Long Live Hungary!'' and chanted for freedom before uniformed police moved in to break up the protest. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Czechoslovaks then marched around <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for another two hours, calling for freedom and the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Czechoslovak party leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, echoing other party officials, condemned the incident as `` interference in Czechoslovak internal affairs by tourists in disguise.'' Seven other Hungarians were among the 50 foreigners and 320 Czechoslovaks detained during the Aug. 21 demonstration. All the others detained were released by last Thursday. `` I do n't think we did anything wrong,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON>, a leading official of the Hungarian youth group <ORGANIZATION> FIDESZ </ORGANIZATION>, said outside court during the all-day trial, to which only Hungarian and Czechoslovak journalists were admitted. `` If armies and tanks come to another country to change things, that's interference, not if young people come with flowers and express their views,'' he added. The fines were immediately paid by the Hungarian consul to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Taba </PERSON>, and both activists were driven to the airport. The charges against them carried a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine of $ 2,000, or both. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, a group of Hungarians camped out in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> ended a hunger strike they began last week to protest the detention of the two activists in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wrapping up work on a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug strategy, said Tuesday his administration will `` cooperate to the best of our ability'' on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s request for an extra $ 19 million to fight drug kingpins. In a meeting with top policy advisers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put new focus on the `` Andean strategy'' to fight drugs in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries that are the source of illicit narcotics, said national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. The adviser said, however, it was too early to comment on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s request for another $ 19 million, on top of the $ 65 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has approved. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also declined to comment directly on the request, advanced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> justice minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, and said details of the aid are `` being worked out now'' in discussions with the Colombians. The president made the comments to reporters after a strategy review with top Cabinet advisers, including the attorney general and secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, on a revamped anti-drug plan that he will announce in a nationally broadcast White House address Sept. 5. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said after the meeting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is adjusting his strategy to respond to the heightened drug crisis in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Drug lords there have launched a series of attacks and threaten to kill more judges in retaliation for extradition of any drug trafficking suspects. He indicated that new focus would be put on the `` Andean strategy'' to provide aid to interdict cocaine in the source countries of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Vacationing at his seaside home on the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> coast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned his Cabinet advisers involved in the international component of the $ 8 billion anti-drug strategy to be unveiled in a week. Asked Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>'s request for $ 19 million in additional aid, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not comment directly. But he said: `` We will cooperate with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the best of our of our ability. I support what the president of that country has been trying to do. and everyone of our cabinet officers here, all of us, agree that this is important step.'' He said he had `` great respect'' for <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s call for foreign drug users to help curb demand for drugs. This demand, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said, is destroying his country. Asked about reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug strategy would include $ 300 million in economic and military aid for the Andean countries, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> told reporters that figure had already been adjusted upward by $ 65 million with the president's announcement of additional helicopters and equipment aid for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> last week. He indicated there could be further adjustments in the figure, but gave no specifics. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, there were these related developments: _ At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said that distribution of the $ 65 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid was awaiting a detailed list of needs from <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials `` When the list is returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delivery will begin,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> a list of equipment available for immediate transfer from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stocks after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> granted the aid. The Colombians, in turn, issued their list of requests. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> declined to say what type of equipment would be provided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons, ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medical supplies. _ Mrs <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, holding a news conference at the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, vowed to stay on the job, saying `` the law is under siege in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and we must protect it every way we can.'' `` I never considered resigning,'' she said in response to a question about such reports. `` The threats are out there, but I am satisfied with my protection right now.'' In the session with reporters covering the vacationing president in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> noted that the primary focus of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug strategy will be on the domestic aspects, including law enforcement assistance, education and treatment programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the meeting at his Walker's Point home where he has been vacationing since Aug. 16. Arriving from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, in addition to Scowcroft, were Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, national drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>'s request for more money was not discussed at the president's meeting because officials had just learned of it in reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're now in discussions with the Colombians over the $ 65 million package. We put it together based on ... what we thought that the Colombians would need in order to undertake the operatiosn that they have in mind,'' he said. `` They're now discussing with us the kind of things they think they need.'' <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said `` it's not clear to me'' what <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>'s extra $ 19 million would be for. But he added that he was not ruling out the possibility of more aid than the $ 65 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is providing from an emergency assistance fund. In addition, the administration has announced a $ 5 million package of security assistance to help protect the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> judges who are a principle target of drug assassins. On a related matter, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said `` it's possible'' that some drug traffickers wanted for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have taken refuge in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where a Sept. 1 deadline for installation of a new government comes up this week. There is no government to install, however, because the country's de facto ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, invalidated last May's elections, after first allegdly rigging them to his <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said the administration would `` have something to say'' about the administraion's position position relative to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this week. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> indicated the $ 19 million she was seeking would be for bullet proof cars and other protective measures for the judicial officials. Scowcroft lauded the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government for `` bravely standing up'' to the drug traffickers who are waging a war of violence and assassination on government officials. `` We want to do everything we can to help the Colombians,'' he said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also would raise the drug issue with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> arrives Wednesday for a two-day private visit with the president here. Scowcroft said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will likely ask the Canadians to get involved in the anti-drug effort in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already had approved the major planks of his new anti-drug strategy. But a draft of his Sept. 5 television address being circulated in the administration contained blanks on some details, including what he will say on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, one official said. The address will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first televised speech to the nation from the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a day before, after nearly three weeks on vacation here.

 The federal price support for soybeans grown this year will be reduced 5 percent to $ 4.53 per bushel from $ 4.77 in 1988, the maximum reduction allowed by law, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the decision was a preliminary one and the final 1989 soybean support rate will be announced by Oct. 1. The reduction in the support rate was required by a formula in the 1985 farm law. But the law says the support can not be cut more than 5 percent in any single year and in no event can be lowered below $ 4.50 per bushel. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists have forecast that soybean prices during the 1989-90 marketing year beginning Sept. 1 may average $ 4.75 to $ 6 per bushel, compared with $ 7.35 in the current year. There is no direct relationship between the market price and the price support in a given year. Soybean production is expected to be up sharply this this year to an estimated 1.9 billion bushels from 1.54 billion in 1988 when drought reduced yields.

 Thai fishermen attacked and sank a boat carrying about 150 Vietnamese refugees, and nearly everyone on board was believed dead, a witness told authorities. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjapong </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <LOCATION> Songkhla </LOCATION> marine police, said the witness told him the refugees left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on June 15 in a boat headed for <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. He said the witness, <LOCATION> Pham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuc </LOCATION>, 17, reported the boat was attacked two days later by two Thai fishing vessels. She told him that two fishermen armed with knives boarded the Vietnamese boat and robbed its passengers, and then they took her, 10 older women and three boys aboard their own boats. She said the pirates then rammed the Vietnamese boat six or seven times and sank it. About half of those on board disappeared as soon as the boat went down, she said, and the rest were believed to have drowned later. The refugee said she and the 10 women were kept on one of the fishing boats for about a week, raped by five of eight fishermen, and later thrown overboard. She said someone on a passing boat threw her a buoy but refused to take her aboard. A Thai fishing boat finally brought her ashore June 28. The police officer said she had been living with the family of one of the fishermen and only recently decided to tell police in the southern town of <LOCATION> Pattani </LOCATION> about the attack. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said there were no reports about the fate of the other Vietnamese taken aboard the fishing boats. Pirates have been attacking boat people in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> since the refugees began fleeing their homeland following the Communist takeover in 1975. <PERSON> Prakob </PERSON> said the latest attack was the 48th reported this year. Police so far have arrested 14 suspects in connection with six other cases, he said. On <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a vessel carrying 111 Vietnamese refugees landed at a fishing village, said <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>, spokeswoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Migration.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attackers dragged 14 men from their homes Tuesday and killed them, part of a new wave of Sinhalese violence that left 59 people dead, officials and witnesses said. The reports came on the second day of a weeklong strike called by the radicals to protest what they call genocide of their supporters by the government. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, most shops, offices and businesses were open, but only about 30 percent of government employees reported for work, an official said. Residents of the village of <LOCATION> Pandura </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said 14 Sinhalese men were pulled from of their homes before dawn and shot by people wearing army-style uniforms. The Sinhalese-dominated government is fighting to put down a violent campaign by Sinhalese radicals opposed to official peace overtures toward ethnic Tamil rebels. The attack in <LOCATION> Panadura </LOCATION> followed another killing in the area Sunday, when suspected Sinhalese radicals slayed a soldier and four members of her family, residents reported. Military officials, who may not be identified under briefing rules, confirmed 14 bodies were found near <LOCATION> Panadura </LOCATION> on Tuesday. But they denied that army personnel were responsible for the deaths. The officials said at least 25 other bodies were found elsewhere in the Sinhalese-dominated south and center of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. In addition, residents near the <LOCATION> Kalu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said 11 bodies had been thrown into the river. Military officials did not mention those bodies. Scores of such unidentified bodies have been found in recent weeks. Opposition politicians and human rights groups say such bodies are of suspected radicals killed in revenge attacks by security forces or pro-government vigilante groups. In other violence, the military officials said at least nine people were killed in several attacks by the radicals during the 24 hours ending Tuesday evening. They said the victims included a former government lawmaker and four of her bodyguards, two lawyers, and two policemen. At least 5,000 people have been killed in Sinhalese violence since the radicals launched their anti-government campaign in July 1987. They say the government should be tougher in trying to end a 6-year-old Tamil insurgency in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. They also claim that the presence of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops, who have tried unsuccessfully to end the Tamil uprising, compromises <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. In the Sinhalese general strike, radical groups had announced in posters pasted on walls in the capital that employees could go to their jobs but should refuse to work. Steel-helmeted policemen and soldiers in camouflage uniforms were posted in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and other major cities to ward off any attacks by the radicals.

 Soldiers and Moslem guerrillas fought in several provincial cities Tuesday and 10 rockets hit the capital, the government said. Rival guerrilla groups were reported fighting each other in northern and western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a speech to the opening session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to stop interfering in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The three nations are the guerrillas' main backers Government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> said one of the rockets struck a house, wounding two people inside, and seven hit the airport but caused no injuries. Employees and passengers fled the combined civilian-military airport and passengers were told to return Wednesday for their luggage, which was being unloaded when the rockets landed about 100 yards away. <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> said the level of fighting between the army and guerrillas in three eastern cities had declined in recent days, and rocket barrages had replaced close combat. Soldiers advanced east of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and parried a guerrilla advance on <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, about 100 miles to the southeast, he said. <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> also claimed government troops won victories around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in the southeast. He reported fighting between guerrilla factions around the western city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> and in the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Badakhshan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Konduz </LOCATION>. The government spokesman and independent sources said the battles were between two fundamentalist groups _ <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> fighters under field commander <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masood </PERSON>. At least 22 guerrillas were killed and an unknown number wounded in the foothills and mountains 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> said. He said he did not have statistics for the other areas. The independent sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said serious trouble appeared to be developing between the rival groups. Jamiat leaders accused <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> last month of ordering the killings of at least 30 of its guerrillas in the field, including some commanders. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> resumed his call for U.N.-supervised elections and said to Parliament: `` The aggressive hand of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> should be off <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' In a weekend speech in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, released in English on Tuesday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the fighting had changed from a jihad, or holy war, to fratricide. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces entered the war in December 1979 and withdrew in February after more than nine years of involvement. The main guerrilla groups are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor

 Declaring that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s Turkish minority was trapped in a `` tragic situation'' of human rights violations, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced Monday it had recalled the American ambassador to the East European country and joined <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies in condeming <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. A strong statement issued at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> followed what a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said was a recent worsening of the situation and an inability by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to absorb many more than the 311,000 ethnic Turks who have taken refuge in the country. While estimates vary, about 1 million people of Turkish extraction live in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> where, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, they are systematically denied the right to speak the Turkish language and practice Turkish culture. The Turkish government recently required visas of ethnic Turks emigrating from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The Bulgarian government accused <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> of hypocrisy. Turkish border officials said they had strict orders to turn away the refugees waiting to cross into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. However, the semi-official Turkish news agency <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds were allowed to enter without visas last week. Turkish opposition parties accused the government of backing away from its pledge to accept all ethnic Turks who wanted to come, while <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> blamed <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for refusing to hold talks on an immigration agreement. The Turkish ethnics, with strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, accused <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> of forcible assimilation, beginning in 1974, that made practicing Islamic rites more difficult. `` The situation just continues to get worse,'' said <PERSON> Richarrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said. `` Repression continues.'' He said Ambassador <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Polansky </PERSON> had been recalled from <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> `` for consultations'' and that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was considering assistance for the refugees. `` The ongoing abuse of the human rights of Bulgarian ethnic Turks by the government of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> remains an issue of serious concern to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' the statement said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has made its views on this matter known to the government of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> both publicly and privately, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spoken several times to <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> leaders to express our strong support for their efforts to end this tragic situation,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Darpatov </PERSON>, spokesman for the Bulgarian embassy, denied the allegations. He said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had set preconditions for discussing the problem with his government, including recognition of a distinct Turkish ethnic group in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. `` There should be a dialogue between the two neighoring countries and we are not pleased when other countries interfere in bilateral relations,'' <PERSON> Darpatov </PERSON> said. The Bulgarian diplomat said `` nobody has been persecuted for his religion'' in the country. <PERSON> Darpatov </PERSON> said his government, in accord with the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords, permits all of its citizens to travel abroad.

 Shiite Moslem chief <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said Tuesday that to solve the hostage crisis, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should help end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. `` My advise to the Americans and everyone is to help resolve the Lebanese problem,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> told reporters representing foreign media at his heavily fortified office in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` They have to go to the core of the problem in order to be able to help resolve the hostage problem,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said. At least 802 people have been killed and 2,268 wounded, nearly all of them civilians, since the latest outbreak in the civil war began March 8 between Christian forces and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the moderate, Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement, also said the hostage issue was linked to the 1982 Israeli invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Israeli army withdrew from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 after a three-year occupation but set up a self-designated security zone in the south, six to 10 miles deep, as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Why was it before 1982 that we did n't hear of any kidnapping?'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> asked. `` Because before 1982 we did n't have the Israeli invasion. All that happened to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> came after that date.'' Sixteen foreigners are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most are believed held by pro-Iranian, <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremist groups. They include eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, one Italian and one Irishman. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Amal is not involved in seizing hostages. The hostage-holding groups are believed to come under the umbrella of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced the end of 16 months of intermittent clashes between their rival factions for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest sect. The feud killed nearly 575 people and wounded more than 1,550, by police count. <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> said the `` mission for <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> now is to jointly confront the new Crusaders' invasion.'' He referred to a French naval buildup in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, which the Shiites claim was designed to support Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in his confrontation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Moslem militia allies.

 A woman who settled a crack debt by allowing her 13-year-old daughter to be raped was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday. `` The child is grateful her pain is finally over,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said after the sentencing. `` She can begin rebuilding herself.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>, 29, was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, the charge for rape in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, for giving her daughter to a man who raped her twice. The crime normally carries 10 to 25 years in prison, but Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> gave `` flagrantly false testimony'' at her trial and showed no potential for reform. The man who raped the girl, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 28, was convicted of the same charge and was sentenced Thursday by another judge to 40 to 60 years in prison. <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> had maintained her innocence at all times and had also claimed that she had been punished enough because her children had been taken from her. `` That is not a punishment for someone with such little regard for her children,'' <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> told her. `` Your daughter trusted you and you abused that trust beyond all bounds of decency.'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>'s daughter called the 1988 rape `` the worst hour of my life.'' According to testimony by <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> offered her daughter to satisfy a drug debt, then smoked crack with <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> afterward. <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> is eligible for parole in 10 years. Her former husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dare </PERSON>, has been granted temporary custody of the victim. Two other children, ages 6 and 8, are staying with a relative. `` This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact of drugs on innocent people,'' the judge said. `` I have not heard of such a situation where drugs were responsible for a mother subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse.''

 Voyager 2 cruised away from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $ 865 million trek past 60 worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent destruction of their own planet. `` If you want to understand <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, go look at other worlds,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>, a member of the team that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1. `` Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.'' As scientists held a final news conference at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 4.2 million miles beyond <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the solar system's fourth-largest and currently most-distant planet. Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path that took it from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in 1977, past Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986, and now past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in search of the edge of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. For $ 865 million _ 20 cents per year per American since the project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and examining worlds of wonder, like <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, with its sulfur-spewing volcanoes. `` As exciting as the discoveries at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> have been, this encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` For those of us fortunate enough to be involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.'' At <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to Nereid and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet. It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings. The spacecraft detected in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s bluish atmosphere an Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below. Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy, pinkish <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more recently than a half billion years ago, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON>. The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years. <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look as it would to someone standing on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface and seeing the crater in three dimensions. Scientists also presented new findings Tuesday showing <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s weak, tilted magnetic field does n't go through the center of planet but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface That, plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as inside the Earth. `` These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of Captain <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> or even the posthumous accounts of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Planetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, former director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` The discoveries challenge our imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their grandchildren.'' The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human masters to the vulnerability of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a tiny garden threatened by nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone shield. `` If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,'' <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> first warned of depletion of Earth's ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to help <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> understand the atmosphere of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> now works at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> and other planetary scientists developed the theory that smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange of warheads. `` The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner 9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the runaway `` greenhouse effect'' on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, where thick clouds trap solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees. <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks to answer that most fundamental question _ `` where we come from, how we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.'' Voyager 2 keeps looking back at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> until Oct. 2. Then, like <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting information about particles and magnetic fields in space and searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the probes can continue transmitting data until 2020.

<HEAD>Net Farm Income Should Be Better Than Expected This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cash receipts from larger crops this year are boosting net farm income more sharply than had been expected, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that nationally net farm income could rise more than 10 percent this year to between $ 48 billion and $ 53 billion, $ 1 billion more than forecast in July. Last year's net income was around $ 44 billion, and the record was $ 47 billion in 1987. As used by the agency, net farm income includes the value of agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm, and allowances for family dwellings and other adjustments, minus total operating expenses. In another method of accounting, the report said this year's net cash income `` could fall from last year's record $ 60 billion.'' Net cash income does not include changes in inventory values and is simply gross cash income during the year minus cash operating expenses. Economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops and livestock are expected to rise $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion this year, more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments to farmers. Total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent, largely because of more land being brought into crop production. `` Wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15 percent this year, following sizeable gains last year'' the report said. `` Vegetable receipts are also expected to rise. Soybeans, however, probably will see falling receipts as higher domestic production and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decrease in prices.'' Total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise, but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop, the report said. Although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to be small _ less than $ 500 million _ it will be on top of a $ 1 billion reduction in 1988.

 The government reportedly arrested 5,000 political workers Tuesday and asked others to stay in offices overnight to prevent a nationwide strike to demand the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Four major opposition parties set the general strike for Wednesday in their latest attempt to focus attention on their charges of government corruption. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said as many as 5,000 political workers were arrested across the country Tuesday. There were no details on any charges. The opposition has said that all businesses should be closed and public transportation, except for essential services, should come to a halt during the strike. The strike was intended as a show of strength before parliamentry elections later this year. The government also asked thousands of its employees to stay in their offices overnight so they could report for duty Wednesday. Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government was paying to provide food and bedrolls for the employees. They were allowed to bring children into offices, the officials said. Senior government executives were given rooms in luxury hotels near their offices, they said. No official announcement was made about how many employees were involved. Government employees in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said thousands of people were being asked to stay on. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified government spokesman as saying officials absent from work Wednesday would lose a day's salary The government planned to provide full security to all Indians who wish to work, he was quoted as saying. Trains, state-owned buses, and air services would function normally, he reportedly said. The opposition has repeatedly accused the government of corruption in past weeks. Last month, 106 opposition members in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> demanded that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resign, saying a July government audit of an arms deal showed that senior officials received kickbacks. When <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> refused, the opposition members resigned in a rare display of solidarity. The opposition charge relates to a $ 1.4 billion deal for purchase of artillery guns from AB Bofors of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Opposition politicians say the Swedish company paid kickbacks amounting to $ 50 million to government officials and members of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. No proof has been offered, and the government has denied wrongdoing. The new elections must be held sometime before the end of the year. In the last general elections in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 415 of 544 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

 Investigators frustrated by a bold heist of more than a ton of silver shaped like <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>'s kisses are hoping the thieves brag and are also watching smelters capable of melting down the $ 200,000-plus cache. `` We do n't have any leads. But they have to melt it down, `` Undersheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` And I'm confident we'll get a tip from somebody who'll hear about the heist. All good crooks brag about the jobs they pulled.'' Officials are investigating past and present employees of the Trinity Silver Mine, where the robbery took place Saturday night. The mine is about 20 miles from <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON>, a town more than 90 miles northeast of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. `` We're fairly sure it was an inside job,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` They knew something about the mine.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns part of the mine, said a shotgun-toting man in a red ski mask tied up two mine employees with duct tape and, with an accomplice who was either a woman or a small man, used a wheelbarrow to haul 1.25 tons of silver buttons to a pickup. They then left spikes in the road to flatten tires of any pursuers. The robbery was discovered when the next shift came in Sunday morning, police said. The bound employees were n't injured. It took the robbers more than one hour to haul the silver from a locked vault to the pickup, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. He said the thieves apparently broke the lock. The buttons are made when silver removed from the mine's ore is melted and poured into molds. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the mine normally waits until it has about 50,000 ounces _ more than 1.5 tons _ of dore, or impure silver, before it ships a load to a smelter for refining. The mine was expected to produce about $ 4 million worth of silver this year. <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities notified precious metals dealers. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and smelter operators said the crooks would probably melt the silver themselves through an arrangement with a smelter or try to ship it out of the country. `` They seem to have thought out everything else beforehand, so I'm sure they've thought this through, too,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, associate dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Mackay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION>, said authorities could trace the silver by examining its makeup. Every precious metal sample has its own unique mix of impurities. `` A normal refinery would wish to know the source of the silver so if they're suspicious they would probably report it,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> added. However, he noted that crooks could add impurities to change the silver's makeup. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said the crooks could easily ship the cache out of the country because there are no controls on shipping gold and silver. `` The trading is pretty wide open,'' he said. `` That's why mining companies pay a lot of attention to security.'' Smelting companies contacted Tuesday all refused to comment on the record about their operations. `` You do n't like to talk about details of the operation because, well, it's sort of like telling someone when the Brinks trucks are going out,'' said a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> official of one of the larger precious-metal refining firms.

 A leader of the movement demanding the transfer of the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has been acquitted of corruption charges, a documentary filmmaker said Tuesday. <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Manucharov </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was jailed last autumn along with other committee leaders blamed for organizing mass demonstrations in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. Filmmaker <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON>, who is making a movie about <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that a lower court had thrown out corruption charges against <PERSON> Manucharov </PERSON> and the appeals court upheld that decision Friday. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manucharov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> glass factory manager, never was accused of a crime connected to the protests. On Sunday, <PERSON> Manucharov </PERSON> was elected to a vacant seat in the Armenian legislature with more than 90 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> said. Authorities earlier refused to recognize his candidacy because he was in jail. <PERSON> Ruderman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manucharov </PERSON> apparently has not yet been released from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Butirsky Prison. Meanwhile, Soviet Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> reported that someone made `` an unconstitutional attempt to take power'' in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> last week, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. It quoted <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> as saying a person was killed, but did not say when the incident occurred or give other details.

<TEXT>
 An old courier returned home to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Tuesday after nearly 45 years, and he carried with him the message of hope. `` This is the culminating moment of my whole life,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, the `` Courier from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>,'' who is remembered for risking his life repeatedly in acting as a go-between for the Polish underground <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> government-in-exile during the Nazi occupation of World War II. `` Two months ago I thought -LRB- this moment -RRB- would never come,'' said <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, 76. `` I am so old I thought it would never come.'' As he stepped foot back in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, he flashed the Solidarity `` V-for-victory'' sign. He was greeted with cheers, kisses, flowers and a song of welcome. <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> escaped <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in October 1944 after the doomed 1944 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> and, mindful of the persecution of ex-Home <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers after the war's end, remained abroad for the decades that followed. Aside from his World War II exploits, <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, who lives outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, earned the anger of the postwar communist government because he headed the Polish section of <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-government-financed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> for 24 years, beaming in uncensored information in Polish. In that role, he frequently was attacked in the official press and by longtime government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stopped jamming Radio Free Europe broadcasts on Jan. 1, 1988, and <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> is able to return thanks to an improved political climate _ marked by the restoration of Solidarity's legal status in April and the election of Solidarity parliament representatives and a Solidarity prime minister since June. Waiting to greet him Tuesday was a high-level delegation from the Solidarity movement, led by the group's parliamentary leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, veteran activist <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuratowska </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Celinski </PERSON>. Asked what <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>'s return meant for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Celinski </PERSON> replied: `` Everything.'' A group of about 50 Poles was on hand to welcome <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, including a few veterans of the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which was persecuted by the communists after the war but has been gradually rehabilitated in recent years. `` We Poles look at the world through the prism of the war, because it was then that the character of a man was shaped,'' said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, who remembered meeting <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> after the 1944 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> and still regards him as a hero. `` When he was fighting, leaving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> meant a 99 percent chance of death,'' said <PERSON> Rodak </PERSON>. `` But he took the risk. It is a great thing for us. We value his courage and his sacrifices for the homeland.'' As <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> emerged from the VIP lounge at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Okecie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, the crowd serenaded him with a round of `` Sto Lat,'' or `` May He Live 100 Years.'' `` Long live Solidarity,'' replied the beaming <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, now a member of the national leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, gained additional fame in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the mid-1980s when his book, `` Courier from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>,'' was issued in Polish by the opposition's clandestine Nowa publishing house. It became an underground best-seller. Several of the bystanders gave him flowers, kissed him and asked him to autograph copies of the book. Invited as a guest of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the Solidarity parliamentary caucus, <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> will participate in a series of Solidarity and church observances of the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II this Thursday and Friday.

 <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s widow announced Tuesday she will not run for his <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat this fall. In a statement, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a 30-year-old investment banker, cited her family responsibilities in deciding against seeking the seat held by her husband for 10 -LCB- years before his death in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> on Aug. 7.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corporations' after-tax profits fell 5.4 percent in the April-June quarter, the biggest decline in three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The decline followed a smaller 1.1 percent drop in the first three months of the year and left after-tax profits at an annual rate of $ 164.3 billion in the second quarter. Analysts attributed the drop, the biggest since a 16.5 percent decline in the first quarter of 1986, to rising business costs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> busineses have enjoyed substantial profit gains over the past two years, reflecting a major cost-cutting effort and a boom in export sales. But many economists predicted that this period is drawing to a close and profit increases this year will be much more modest. `` We could not keep the boom in corporate profits going forever,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The second quarter represents a slowing of that extraordinary momentum, primarily because of cost increases for energy and raw materials.'' The decline in profits for the second quarter was lead by a drop in earnings for auto companies, the report said. Profits for transportation companies and public utilities, however, rose during the second quarter. Among the details in the profits report: _ Before-tax profits dropped a sharp 6.4 percent in the second quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 297.6 billion, after falling a slight 0.3 percent in the first quarter _ Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and inventories, fell 2.3 percent in the second quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 309.1 billion, after posting an even bigger 7 percent decline in the first quarter _ Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds corporations have for investment, rose 1.6 percent in the second quarter, to an annual rate of $ 394.7 billion, after falling 5.6 percent in the first quarter Dividend payments to stockholders increased 2 percent to an annual rate of $ 120.9 billion after a 2.9 percent increase in the first quarter.

 A Soviet labor camp inmate who met recently with two visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen is being moved to another facility where conditions are worse, an advocacy group for Soviet Jews said Tuesday. The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews said it believes <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazachkov </PERSON> is being punished for his outspokenness with the American visitors. <PERSON> Kazachkov </PERSON> was tried on Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> Camp 35 on charges of `` refusal to work'' and sentenced to be transferred to the Chistopol prison, the union said. <PERSON> Kazachkov </PERSON>, a physicist who heads a human rights monitoring group at the camp, went on strike with eight other inmates to demand safer work conditions, the union said. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalev </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, told the Washington-based group in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the food and conditions at Chistopol are worse than at <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 35, `` and there is less opportunity for fresh air.'' <PERSON> Kazachkov </PERSON>, 45, was arrested in 1975, one week after applying to emigrate. He was convicted of treason and other offenses and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp. In 1981 he was given an additional 3 -LCB- years after protesting prison conditions. In 1987, the authorities offered to free <PERSON> Kazachkov </PERSON> if he confessed to his alleged crimes on television, but he refused, the union said. He suffered a heart attack the same year. Last December, he was visited by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, and last month he was allowed a visit by Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. In an interview, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said Soviet authorities had promised him there would not be any reprisals of the kind carried out against some prisoners after <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>'s visit. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said he had spoken with 23 of the 38 inmates at <ORGANIZATION> Perm </ORGANIZATION> 35, which is situated in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` There's no doubt <PERSON> Kazachkov </PERSON> is a prisoner of conscience. He ought to be released from prison,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` This is an opportunity for the Soviets to review his and other cases and to show that glasnost is coming to the prison system too.''

 A man who may have the only clues to the 1980 disappearance of an industrialist is about to inherit nearly half the businessman's $ 1.3 million estate. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON>, who was with industrialist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, then 73, on vacation in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> disappeared, has refused to talk to police, and investigators have turned up no information on <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>'s whereabouts Most of <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>'s estate will be divided, according to his will, between <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON>, 56, and a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> school district once Probate Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lensing </PERSON> signs an order disbursing the money. Lensing's action is considered a formality. <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> made his fortune in decorative plastics for appliances, automobiles and business machines. His will, written in 1976, became public in 1987 after the state asked that <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> be declared legally dead. The court case dragged on while the state and other parties challenged Lensing's decision to offer a $ 500,000 reward and spend $ 100,000 from the estate on a renewed investigation into <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>'s disappearance A state appeals court overturned Lensing's decision last month. <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> in December 1979 for his annual four-month vacation, and <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON> soon joined him, court records show. Both men were reported missing in January 1980. <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON> showed up the next month with a lawyer at the <ORGANIZATION> Evansville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He refused to answer questions. Lensing ordered <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON> to appear at a hearing, but he refused to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON> and the school district in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> grew up, each will receive $ 441,797. <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON> also will get the $ 129,000 <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> duplex he shared with <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers Tuesday demolished or sealed seven houses belonging to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> families whose sons are accused of bombings or attacking suspected collaborators with Israeli authorities. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers opened fire during a stone-throwing protest killing a 27-year-old student, the army said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, an Arab man suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities died of wounds. The deaths raised to 554 the number of Palestinians killed by soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising and to 100 the toll of Palestinians slain by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as alleged collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died. Also Tuesday, Palestinian uprising leaflets appeared for the first time signed by a group calling itself <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. A government source said officials think the group, like the radical <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is tied to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Hezbollah and the revolutionary court of justice are going to lay in wait for the Zionists and take revenge for every drop of blood spilled by their hands,'' said the leaflets. The government source said many leaflets were distributed in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, but Palestinians said only a few have appeared. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials think the group was formed by fundamentalist Moslem Palestinians deported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who made their way to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the source said. The student killed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> ws identified as <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON>. He had been jailed four times in the 20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied territories and was described by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters as head of <ORGANIZATION> Shabiba </ORGANIZATION>, the youth movement of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> An army spokeswoman confirmed soldiers killed <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON>. Hospital officials in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> confirmed the death of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hila </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahama </PERSON>, 40, from a skull fracture he sustained last week. The <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said he was injured when youths in the town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> firebombed his house. The army said it was checking the report. Hospital officials said at least 16 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A 29-year-old teacher also was reported shot in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> when soldiers fired at youths who fled into a schoolyard in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a Jewish youth was stabbed by an 18-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rishon </LOCATION> Lezion town near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in what a police spokesman said appeared a politically motivated act. The victim was slightly injured. Soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> destroyed two houses in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Askar </PERSON> villages and sealed five other homes in Askar and <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> town, army spokesmen said. Those who lived in the houses are accused of setting fire to an army truck, planting a roadside bomb and attacking suspected Arab collaborators, the army said. One suspect is accused of killing an alleged collaborator. Arab reporters said the houses belonged to families whose sons, aged 15 to 26, are suspected of anti-Israeli violence. They said most of the sons are in jail and one was convicted of a firebombing and sentenced to two years imprisonment. Forty-two people lived in the homes destroyed and sealed, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army has demolished more than 200 houses and sealed over 100 during the uprising in a collective punshiment the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights groups condemn as a violation of due process since most suspects never are tried. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the military issued an order requiring special permits for Palestinians to own facsimile machines following reports that they are used to distribute anti-Israeli leaflets. The Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> called on the government to reverse the order, saying it will be viewed abroad as interference in civilian life and could harm <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image. `` Outlawing the popular, civilian communications machine will obviously serve as a juicy news item throughout the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Tuesday criticizing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for failing to fully cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors overseeing the world body's independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insists it is complying with the one-year <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to end its 74-year rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The resolution demands the complete disbandment of a notorious paramilitary police unit called <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> and demands all parties comply strictly with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, `` especially <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said he had `` considerable doubts about the evenhandedness'' of a resolution singling out <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but voted in favor to preserve unanimity. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said he voted for the resolution because it was a `` compromise among several strongly held positions about <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.'' The reprimand was watered down during days of bargaining between African and Western council members. The original draft attacked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for `` not complying'' with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> succeeded in weakening that language. The resolution calls for complete impartiality by the Namibian broadcast media during the current election campaign and asks Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to see <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> conducts a free and fair election. Tuesday's vote follows two weeks of speeches by about 40 nations complaining <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is trying to rig the November election against the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla-backed movement favored to form an independent government. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a group of prominent American jurists, former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and legislators who have just returned from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> echoed the criticism. The group, called the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of trying `` to do everything they can to manipulate the process,'' in the words of Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, D-MI, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. His group also called for <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> to be purged. The resolution adopted by the 15 <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members does not refer to the guerrilla organization, also called <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which fought a 23-year bush war against South African rule. `` I think this clarifies what we've suspected all along, that this was an attempt to whitewash <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and carry on what has been an unnecessarily protracted exercise for reasons that we find difficult to explain,'' said South African U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearar </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> debate appeared to win some response from the protagonists. On Aug. 15, the day before debate opened, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administrator-general in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, announced all 1,200 <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> officers in the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> Police would be withdrawn from northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and confined to base <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members have terrorized guerrilla supporters in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. During the debate, <PERSON> Shearar </PERSON> asked why the council was not investigating allegations the guerrrilla movement still is detaining hundreds of political prisoners. Following his speech, the guerrilla organization announced that for the first time it would let the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other international inspectors visit its camps. In April, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> released about 200 detainees held on suspicion of spying, but those freed say they were tortured and that at least 1,000 more prisoners are held in camps in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, who filed littering charges against the passenger railroad, had offered to drop the three misdemeanor counts if <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> agreed to stop dumping from trains passing over two overwater trestles. But <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, whichhas been dumping along its right of way under a federal law that railroads have been using for more than a century, contends federal law overrides state and local law. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> risks losing service if it presses the case. An arraignment was scheduled Sept. 18. The charges carry fines of up to $ 5,000 each. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at least 35 mph. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> tried to halt the practice only over the two trestles. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said agreeing to <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s conditions would make <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> a target for similar demands over every body of water in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` With the myriad waterways in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, it would be an impossible situation,'' he said Monday. The railroad hopes to replace much of its fleet with new cars equipped with holding tanks for all toilets. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said it would cost $ 147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> fears having to hire a worker to stand in each car to throw an override switch for toilets when the trains cross bodies of water, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> is bluffing and could not afford to cut back service in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> or the Western states _ <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> _ where it has also come under fire for its sanitary habits. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said that the criminal case is the only one of its kind against <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> of which he is aware. Two civil cases are pending in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, he said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said Tuesday a provisional government will take over on sept 1, inauguration day under the constitution, and the opposition said it would be dictatorship `` behind a new facade.'' Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said five opposition party members were arrested near the Costa Rican border on charges of threatening national security. No official announcement has been made of the government's form or makeup, but most observers expect it to be a junta approved by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the military and police commander who wields the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said Tuesday `` all possible formulas of government'' were being evaluated and `` we will do the best for the country.'' he said. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said it would be a `` provisional government with the widest possible political support.'' The opposition, which international observers say won a 3-1 victory in the May 7 election, said it would not be involved in the new regime. The government <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sponsors annulled the election on grounds of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. `` interference.'' The opposition was invited to join a junta but refused, saying it would continue its campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. `` We refused the offer for a share of bureaucratic spoils,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, opposition vice presidential candidate and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said the new government will be `` a continuation of the military dictatorship'' and the opposition expects `` repression and the crisis to continue and the dictatorship to go on behind a new facade.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not recognize the new government. `` There can be no accomodation with a government in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the real power,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking and laundering money. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> applied economic sanctions in an attempt to force him from power. The general calls the campaign against him a disguised attempt to renege on the 1977 treaties that turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said Tuesday: `` The permanence of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> is part of the struggle for national liberation. We can not accept an improvement of relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> based on the acceptance of the removal of an official of the Panamanian government under pressure.'' Meanwhile, a communique read over <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the five opposition members arrested planned to destroy bridges and provoke violence and had undergone guerrilla training on the Costa Rican side of the border. It said the suspects were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but gave no other details. There was no immediate comment from the party. Defense Forces sources in the <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> near the border who asked not to be named said the arrests had taken place over the past few days. Three weeks ago, the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> government denied reports in the Panamanian press that rebels were training in Villa Neilly near the border.

<HEAD>Appeals Court OKs Random Drug Tests for Some Army Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> may subject more than 6,500 of its civilian workers to random drug tests, including law enforcement and aviation personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 implemented drug testing for more than 9,000 of its 450,000 civilian employees. In a 3-0 decision, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said 3,700 civilian police and guards should face mandatory drug tests because of the threat to public safety posed by `` drug-impaired, gun-toting civilian officers.'' The 2,800 civilians who fly and service the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s airplanes and helicopters also should undergo random drug testing due to the possibly `` calamitous consequences'' of a single drug-related lapse, the appeals court said. A small group of civilian laboratory workers do n't have to undergo mandatory, random testing, said the decision by appeals court judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>. The appeals court said it was unable to determine whether random tests should be imposed on a group of employees that includes some secretaries and engineering technicians. The appeals court returned that portion of the case to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for further consideration. Employee unions, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, launched a court challenge to the legality of the random portions of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s civilian testing program. The government argued that compulsory testing was justified by compelling governmental interests in maintaining the safety, security and integrity of its workforce. A lower court permanently enjoined the testing in 1988, concluding that mandatory, random testing constituted an unreasonable search. The permanent injunction was delayed pending outcome of the appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in its first ruling on testing for drug and alcohol abuse in the American workplace, last March said workers in sensitive government jobs or those entrusted with public safety may be forced to undergo the tests.

<HEAD>West Trying to Subvert Socialism, Says Vietnam's Party Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The general secretary of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accused President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Western leaders of trying to take advantage of reforms in some countries to undermine socialism, according to a report available Tuesday <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> told the 7th plenum of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that reforms in some socialist lands were causing `` newly arising difficulties.'' `` We express our profound concern over the danger threatening... socialism in some fraternal socialist countries. He said that Western politicians, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, left `` no stone unturned in an attempt to affect the situation in a number of socialist countries with the aim of driving these into the free world of capitalism.'' The plenum was held in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> from Aug. 15-24. A text of <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>'s speech at the closing session was broadcast Monday on Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Tuesday `` In a number of socialist countries currently facing many difficulties, the imperialists and reactionary forces are colluding ... to undermine the gains of the socialist revolution,'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is also affected by this international situation. Over the past few days, official <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> news reports have denounced `` counterrevolutionaries'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the first non-Communist prime minister for 46 years was appointed last week. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>'s speech seemed to indicate a predominately conservative streak in Vietnamese politics, despite some liberal reforms. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> is closed aligned with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is making major economic and social reforms. However, the 7th plenum rejected `` bourgeois liberalization, pluralism, political plurality and multi-opposition parties aimed at denying Marxism-Leninism, socialism and the party's leadership,'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said. He said `` serious shortcomings'' in the Vietnamese party's own ideological work had `` caused certain persons to mistakenly believe that the nature of imperialism had changed.'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> accused some party members of `` irresponsible, disorganized and undisciplined acts'' and of inciting `` a number of people to disturb public order and security and engage in factional activities.'' In his criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has continued its space defense program and tightened its `` military belts'' around socialist countries. He charged that it had established arms caches in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and was `` scheming'' to set up military bases in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. `` All these acts are part of their menace strategy relying on military strength to oppose the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -LRB- and -RRB- socialist countries,'' he said. `` We do not nurture the illusion that the imperialists ... are willing to achieve peaceful coexistance with us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Banned Pesticides Enter U.S. in Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An environmental group said Tuesday new laws are needed to prevent chemical companies from manufacturing highly toxic pesticides banned in this country and sending them abroad. The practice `` has created a circle of poison'' where in some cases food tainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sold to consumers, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquardt </PERSON>, who has followed the issue for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> cited the practices of the <ORGANIZATION> Velsicol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which from its plant in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is the world's only producer of the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor. Both pesticides have been banned for agricultural use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1978 and for virtually all other uses in recent years because they were found to cause cancer. The two pesticides, which had been widely used for treatment of termites, have been banned or severely restricted for use in 48 countries because of their carcinogenic properties. Nevertheless, said Ms. <PERSON> Marquardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON> exported nearly 5 million pounds of the two pesticides to 25 countries between 1987 and the middle of this year. More than 330,000 pounds went to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and another 510,000 pounds to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, countries that import meat and other products into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a statement issued from the chemical company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> report on its continued sale of the two pesticides abroad as `` grossly inaccurate'' and said it remained committed to producing the products and shipping them abroad. `` Forty years of product use and research conducted by scientists who are experts in their field support the continued use of chlordane and heptachlor,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frommer </PERSON>, the company's vice president of government, regulatory and public affairs He suggested in some cases there are no practical substitutes for the chemicals, a contention disputed by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, who participated in a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, accused Velsicol of failing to inform their foreign customers of the danger posed by the two pesticides. He accused the company of `` manipulation of information'' about the two chemicals and that warning labels often are not explicit and people handling the pesticides not aware of precautions that should be taken. `` If these products are too toxic to be used here -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-, they are too toxic to be used anywhere,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Marquardt </PERSON>. She maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are too shorthanded to adequately monitor food imports for content of pesticides that have been banned in this country. She said last year two shipments of beef from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were found to have been contaminated with the Velsicol pesticides. She said heptachlor contamination also has been found in imported carrots, pineapples, garbanzo beans and cheese, although the source of the contamination was not clear.

<HEAD>Japan Sees Chance to Ban Chemical Arms Slipping Away</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> told international negotiators ending their latest talks Tuesday they may be letting chances fade for adopting a global ban on chemical weapons. <PERSON> Chusei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s chief envoy to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, suggested the conference agree on a target date for adopting a draft treaty. As the chemical weapons talks ended the 10-week session, <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON> said progress was made this year mainly on technical issues. He said the `` important political issues,'' such as provisions for monitoring compliance, were unresolved. <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON> said a 149-nation conference on chemicals arms held in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in January gave political impetus to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, but he expressed `` a sense of uneasiness that the momentum might be slipping out of our fingers.'' The talks were entering a three-month recess. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has told Western allies it will not accept an `` artificial deadline'' at the conference, which has been debating a global convention banning production, stockpiling and use of chemical arms since 1968. French envoy <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Morel </PERSON>, who presides over the conference's chemical arms negotiating committee, said the draft treaty was `` sharply improved'' this year He said new provisions were added on protecting the confidentiality of private chemical plants and progress was made in working out an international inspection mechanism and classification of toxic chemicals to be banned. Conference negotiators expect their next session to begin incorporating U.S.-Soviet proposals on the destruction of stockpiles and inspection procedures into the draft accord, <PERSON> Morel </PERSON> said. Talks on the treaty are to resume Nov. 28. The full conference is expected to reconvene early next year.

<HEAD>Primate's Comments on Jews Stir New Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 World clamor set off by Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s remarks grew louder Tuesday. One charge hurled at the head of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was that he used Nazi-like arguments against Jews. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s Saturday comments were meant to calm international criticism about his church's attitude toward Jews. Instead, his speech set off a new round of controversy about alleged anti-Semitism in the church. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> told pilgrims at <ORGANIZATION> Jasna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monastery </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, that Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews abandon `` anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments. He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty for Jews to insist on removal of a Carmelite convent set up on the edge of the former Nazi German death camp at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are impossible to meet,'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said. But some of his language _ invoking the image of Jews spreading communism, mentioning that some Jews collaborated with <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II, that Jews as businessmen neglected or detested Poles, and saying that Jews have easy access to mass media _ apparently added fuel to charges of anti-Semitism. `` The expressions used by the primate, even contrary to his intentions, pose a danger of deeply wounding the feelings of many of those who are descendants and brothers of the Holocaust victims,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> journalist <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON> in a rare published criticism of <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>. The commentary appeared Monday in the opposition's <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Elsewhere the response was even more biting. Referring to <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s comment about easy Jewish access to mass media, the International League against <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Semitism </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> it regretted that <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> `` made use of arguments used against Jews by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> yesterday and by the extreme right in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> today.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a legislator from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, `` Anti-Semitism has a long history in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and I think it is ridiculous to talk about ` anti-Polonism.' <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s Chief Rabbi <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Toaff </PERSON> said in a newspaper interview the question of anti-Semitism is something the church `` has to face. ... The analysis has to be deep enough to eradicate once and for all the anti-Semitism that still exists in many countries, like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' `` It is particularly serious that it was <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, one noted for diplomacy and political gifts, who confused cause and effects,'' said <PERSON> Tullia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON>, head of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, quoted in the same article Monday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s I Messaggero. The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> issued a statement Monday calling <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s comments `` malicious and out of place.'' They `` bring us back to a period we believed was forgotten: that of 50 years ago, before the war, when comments of this type were made and led to the tragedy that we know about.'' Relations between the Polish church and Jewish organizations were already strained by church refusal to relocate the community of Carmelite nuns from <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. The convent site has been criticized as offensive because most of the camp's victims were executed simply for being Jews. An estimated 2.5 million of the 4 million victims of <LOCATION> Auschwitz-Birkenau </LOCATION> were Jewish. Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, whose diocese includes the camp, announced Aug. 10 that the church was suspending a 1987 agreement to move the convent. He said it could not fulfill the agreement in an atmosphere of `` aggressive demands.'' The proposal to remove the convent, which was founded in 1984 just outside the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> fence, has found little sympathy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Poles have commonly argued that thousands of the victims at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> were Polish political prisoners, including many priests and nuns. Cardinal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCourtray </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said Tuesday it was unlikely that <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s words were meant the way they were received. He said the `` primate and bishops of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not be accused of an anti-Semitism, which they denounce.'' The issue of anti-Semitism remains much discussed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> even though only several thousand Jews remain compared to a prewar Jewish population of 3.5 million. Poles often feel wrongly accused of blanket anti-Semitism or of playing an active role in the Holocaust, carried out by Nazi German occupiers of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Few Poles deny that anti-Semitism exists here, but they often argue that it is exaggerated and note that many Poles risked their own lives to protect Jews during the war.

<HEAD>Britain Publishing Inquiry Into Austrian President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said Tuesday it will publish in full the findings of its inquiry into whether Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> is linked to the Nazi executions of six British commandos in World War II. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the report ordered by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in February 1988 will be published within a few weeks, but no date was fixed. He would not elaborate, and made no comment on a British newspaper report Tuesday that the findings are likely to be inconclusive. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, quoting defense sources, said the report would shed `` fresh light'' on the war record of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general who was an intelligence officer in the German army. But it added `` no major revelations are likely.'' Speculation has arisen that some evidence may be suppressed because of possible postwar links between <LOCATION> Waldheim </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence services. The six commandos were in a raiding party captured in the German-occupied <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> in April 1944. They were handed over for interrogation to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s unit in <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION>, refused to talk, and were executed. It is a crime under the Geneva Convention to kill prisoners of war. An international commission of historians that investigated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s army career reported in February 1988 that the initial `` W'' was on transcripts of interrogations of the six men. The commission said it could not prove a connection between <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and the commandos, but suggested he knew they were shot by the Gestapo under a general order by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to execute commandos. The Britons' fate was part of the commission's inquiry into charges that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> took part in or facilitated atrocities, including massacres of 60,000 Yugoslav partisans and civilians and rounding up Jews for death camps. The commission concluded <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> lied about his war record, knew about atrocities and did nothing to stop them, but left open the question of guilt. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> says he did nothing wrong after being drafted into the German army. For the British inquiry, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> copies of German army war records relating to the commandos' capture. The original files were among documents captured by American forces as the war ended in 1945.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve officer linked to fighter training programs for hirelings of Colombian drug lords was warned by Israeli government officials six months ago to stop his activities, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. It said the officer, Lt.

The radio, which attributed its report to unidentified security sources, said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> earned about $ 800,000 for his work, including providing arms and equipment to the men he was training. The government has begun investigating <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s activities. The radio report indicated the government has been aware for months of <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s operations. Police investigators questioned two more reserve officers in the case Tuesday and said others with possible links to Colombian training would be called. Interrogated were <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsadaka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mariot </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoshani </PERSON>. Israeli newspapers said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was concerned that reports of such involvement by Israeli mercenaries could hurt the country's lucrative arms trade. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and also the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a confidential report by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> security forces, reported that at least five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and 11 British mercenaries helped train teams of assassins for Colombian cocaine traffickers and their right-wing allies. <PERSON> Shapira </PERSON> repeated on Tuesday that neither <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> nor his firm, Hod Hahanit -LRB- Spearhead -RRB-, sold weapons in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He would not comment on reports <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was warned to leave that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. The Yediot Ahronot daily, in a report from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has purchased about $ 350 million worth of Galil rifles, Kfir fighter jets and communications equipment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Police questioned <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> Monday on suspicion of violating <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security laws with his possible involvement in training killers for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said that `` in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, people knew. They asked the head of security in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Embassy to meet <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> and stop his activities. They are illegal and to get out of there and fast.'' It said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> about six months ago to start a training course and was warned by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official not to do so because the group being trained `` was in opposition to the -LRB- Colombian -RRB- government.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> persisted, smuggling equipment and weapons to a camp about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> after paying a $ 100,000 bribe, the report said, but he fled after a second warning saying <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> authorities wanted to arrest him. After <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> left, apparently in April, Colombians at the training camp reportedly held four of <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s Israelis hostage, but freed them after bribes were paid, the report said.

 Four new refugee camps will be built to handle an expected increase in what already is a flood of East Germans fleeing their strict communist homeland through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Abendzeitung </ORGANIZATION> said huge tent cities for refugees were planned in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> and thousands of East Germans visiting <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would be allowed to go directly to the West. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said four new camps with a total capacity of 5,000 people will be built in the southern state as temporary homes for new East German refugees. Two other camps already exist, in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> states. <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> denied the Abendzeitung report that 15,000 East Germans would arrive in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by the weekend. The newspaper sent telexes of its report to other news organizations in advance of Wednesday's publication. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, confirmed that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was preparing for a greater influx of East German refugees. `` It is the federal government's responsibility to make preparations for all possible eventualities,'' he said during an evening newscast on the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network. East Germans are given automatic citizenship by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and receive assistance in starting new lives. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> already has said it would not return East Germans against their will. West German and Hungarian government officials have held talks about the East German refugees. Discontented East Germans have left by the tens of thousands in the past few months, by both legal and illegal means. At least 100,000 are expected to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the end of the year. More than 5,000 East Germans have escaped through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since the liberal communist regime began in May to dismantle the barbed wire and other barriers along its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Scores of East Germans have taken refuge in West German diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the Czechoslovak capital. The situation has caused tension between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> undertake reforms that would remove the reasons for large numbers of people to leave. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> incited the exodus. <PERSON> Junge </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON>, or Youth World, the East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth paper, published a letter Tuesday that called the refugees traitors. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacil </PERSON>, said harboring East Germans in West German diplomatic missions was a `` misuse'' of the function of such facilities, the <PERSON> Badische </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION> reported.

 Merchants boarded up storefronts and swept up broken glass Tuesday after a night of vandalism and looting sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man. Leaders of this city of 54,000 people about 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> moved to prevent another night of violence. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, president of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, met with Mayor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> to try to defuse racial tensions that escalated into rioting Monday night by nearly 200 people on the city's main street and the arrest of 23 people. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, religious and community leaders met with reporters, and called for continued efforts to root out racism in the wake of the fatal shooting of a black teen-ager by white youths last week. In a separate statement, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> called on New Yorkers to pray `` that we will make this moment of shame a time for honesty and renewal.'' Police said the gang in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> attacked four black youths because they believed the four were going to visit a young woman who had spurned one of the gang members. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, was killed. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> violence followed Sunday's shooting of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 26. About 40 businesses and 20 cars were damaged by rocks and bottles, most of them along a mile-long stretch, police said. Four people were injured. Damage was estimated at $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 for broken windows, and officials were still trying to gauge losses from looting, city spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said at an afternoon news conference. Eight of those arrested were charged with burglary, assault and theft. police said. The remaining 15 were charged with disorderly persons offenses. All were released. <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said city patrols were beefed up Tuesday night and officers had orders to arrest any disorderly persons. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was shot after he apparently threatened officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> with a steel rod, said Police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was wanted on drug and weapon charges, was spotted by officers after police received an anonymous call about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. After being told he was under arrest, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> picked up the rod and approached <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, swinging, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, who is white, fired two shots at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, hitting him both times. Police found no drugs on <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The state attorney general's office has taken over the investigation of the shooting At the city's news conference, the victim's sister, <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, called for an end to the violence. `` I really would hope everyone would calm down and wait to see what really happened,'' she said. Before Tuesday's meeting, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> called for <PERSON> Cassissi </PERSON>'s resignation, saying he had mishandled the matter. He said that many in the community became angry over newspaper reports in which the police chief called the shooting a `` justifiable homicide.'' `` That was the catalyst,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` That sparked the anger.'' <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON>, in a statement read Tuesday by city spokesman <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON>, said, `` in the absence of a complete investigation, it appears to me that proper police procedures were followed in the shooting incident.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Reactor Closed Earlier Than Planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The troubled <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, the nation's only helium-cooled reactor, was shut down nearly a year earlier than planned because of cracks in steam tubes, utility officials said Tuesday. The hairline cracks found Aug. 18 in tubes that supply steam to drive the the plant's turbine generator pose no threat to the public, but fixing them would have required a lengthy shutdown anyway, officials said. The 330-megawatt reactor 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has repeatedly experienced equipment problems and unplanned shutdowns since opening in 1976. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> said it planned to end nuclear operations at the plant in June 1990. `` Although we had hoped the plant would perform through the first half of 1990, our board and executive management feel this is the most prudent action to take in light of the new difficulties at the plant,'' said utility Chairman <PERSON> Delwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hock </PERSON>. Utility officials, however, would not rule out resuming nuclear operations at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION>, even though they had ruled it out in December. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said the utility could permanently close the plant, convert it to fossil fuel or resume nuclear operations with financial help. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has licensed the plant to run through 2008. However, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said plant workers have begun removing nuclear fuel from the reactor and are preparing to decommission it. <PERSON> Hock </PERSON> said layoffs are expected, but not for at least a month. He said the shutdown would not hurt the utility financially because it already has written off the estimated costs. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION> never has operated for any length of time at 100 percent capacity. In 1984, a series of equipment problems closed the plant for 22 months. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> identified it as one of the 10 worst-run nuclear power plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The agency took it off the list last year. The latest shutdown came after a routine test Aug. 18 indicated a problem with a control rod in the reactor's fuel core. While replacing the faulty rod, crews discovered the cracks. Gas-cooled reactors have been widely used in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrain </LOCATION> is the only one of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials have blamed the choice of a water-lubricated bearing for its turbine-like helium circulators for many of the plant's problems, saying the bearing proved more sensitive than anticipated. Fort St. <PERSON> Vrain </PERSON> also is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial reactor with a graphite fuel core. The Soviet reactor at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, which exploded and burned in 1986, had a graphite core, which was cooled by water rather than helium.

 Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> vowed Tuesday to stay on the job to fight her country's drug lords and appealed for $ 19 million in new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to protect judges from the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. `` The law is under siege in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and we must protect it every way we can,'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> told a news conference at the official residence of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> ambassador. `` I never considered resigning,'' she said in response to a question about such reports. `` The threats are out there, but I am satisfied with my protection right now.'' The 32-year-old lawyer said she would go back to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> next week after concluding discussions with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration about her request for additional aid. `` I am determined that the integrity of our justice system survives this crisis and I hope to play my full part in assuring this,'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said. The justice minister, who met Monday with Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and other top Justice Departments aides, continued talks Tuesday with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration about her request for another $ 19 million to protect <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judges from assassination. The administration only last week approved a $ 65-million military aid program, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that disbursement of funds under that program is awaiting <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s list of needs. At the news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> told reporters, `` We must uphold the rule of law, and regrettably at this moment that requires intensive physical protection of our judges.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has already promised $ 5 million over two years for training programs to bolster judicial security. `` We have asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for more support not only in words but in resources,'' she told reporters. `` I am very pleased with what we have done, I think we can do more, but I think we can work out things.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, her country's eighth justice minister in three years, said she told <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> needed the additional aid to buy armored cars, metal detectors and other security devices to protect judges from the wave of assassinations mounted by the drug cartel. `` Both our countries are countries of laws even at a time when our enemies are operating against us with no respect for law or even the minimal standards of decency,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, updated its warning against non-essential travel for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and suggested, for the first time, that American citizens living there consider leaving. `` Although Americans have not yet been the target of any violence, visitors and Americans resident in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> should carefully re-evaluate whether it is essential that they travel to or remain in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at this time,'' said the new statement. `` The department believes it would be prudent for those who deem their presence non-essential to seriously consider leaving.'' The last travel advisory, issued last weekend, was limited to recommending that travel to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> be postponed for several weeks. In addition to raising the possibility of resident <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens leaving the country, the update also recommended that new travel to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> be postponed indefinitely. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who discussed his anti-drug strategy with top Cabinet officials at his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> seaside retreat, said the administration `` will cooperate with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the best of our ability.'' The president declined to comment specifically on Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>'s request for more money but added that `` it's being worked out now, the details.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it will begin delivering military equipment under the $ 65 million aid package as soon as it receives a list of materiel sought by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. `` When the list is returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delivery will begin,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters. `` Officials of both governments are now analyzing those needs,'' the spokesman said, adding, `` The <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> is ready to provide immediate airlift. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> declined to say what type of equipment would be provided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons, ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medical supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, raised the possibility that its request to extradite drug trafficker <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> could be delayed while <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reviews emergency extradition procedures promulgated by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. `` Those extradition procedures are complicated, and I think there is a possibility there may be a decision to have the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> rule on those new procedures,'' said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> backed away from <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s earlier prediction that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> would be turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities this week, saying the procedure could take another week. Nevertheless, he said, `` we have every hope and expectation of getting custody of Mr. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>'s comments, said she did not know about a possible <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review of the emergency extradition procedures. In 1987, the court set aside <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s extradition law In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to cancel a hearing set for Wednesday on the Colombian drug crisis out of concern that publicity could endanger law enforcement efforts. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the department advised the panel that `` because of the sensitive nature of the situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at this time that it would not be appropriate to have an open hearing.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>, the assistant administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was set to testify. The panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., said in a statement that committee members would be briefed privately this week <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was also drafting extradition requests for 12 other Colombian drug traffickers under federal indictment. The department wanted <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> `` to have the paperwork so that when someone is captured we would be in a position to have everything signed sealed and delivered to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> was asked about whether her son understood the danger posed by her continuation as justice minister. `` My son is three years old, I think he does n't understand all of the problems that's involved,'' she replied. `` But he knows something about it. I explained to him some things. So I hope he is safe and we are all safe.''

 A huge disk of hydrogen gas discovered 65 million light years away suggests that galaxies are still being formed in the universe, a finding that could modify the current theory that star systems formed within a relatively short time after the `` big bang.'' <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ionosphere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arecibo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, associate professor of astronomy at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, found the gas cloud earlier this year using the 1,000-foot radiotelescope dish at <LOCATION> Arecibo </LOCATION>. Others astronomers said Tuesday that the findings were `` exciting'' and `` important'' and could reshape the current view of the history of the universe. The cloud of hydrogen gas is 10 times larger in diameter than the Milky Way Galaxy, which includes the sun, and appears to be in the shape of a disk that is rotating slowly, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> announced. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiles </PERSON>, a professor of astronomy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said the gas cloud `` is a very important discovery.'' `` It shows that there are clouds of gas out there that have not yet turned into galaxies,'' he said. Further study, said <PERSON> Heiles </PERSON>, could lead to modifications of the basic `` big bang'' concept of the universe. The `` big bang'' theory postulates that the universe began with a cataclysmic explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago and that galaxies of stars formed within a few hundred million years after that. Astronomers have earlier reported findings that suggested star formation within existing galaxies, and studies that indicated that some galaxies may have formed billions of years later than others. But there have been no earlier reported findings of true `` proto-galaxies,'' or star systems at the very beginning of formation. The general belief has been that such formation halted billions of years ago. <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said they made the discovery through luck. They were attempting to calibrate the radiotelescope by aiming it at a part of the sky they thought was empty. `` Before stumbling into this thing, neither I nor <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> were great believers in the existence of such objects,'' <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON> said in a statement. `` But this cloud indicates that the disks of galaxies can form slowly throughout the history of the universe and not just be something that happened during some magic period of the distant past.'' Gas clouds have been discovered in the heavens, but those were associated with existing galaxies. `` This cloud seems to have formed independently, in a pocket of space isolated from other galaxies,'' said <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON>. No stars were found in the gas cloud. Most astronomers believe that galaxies form when hydrogen atoms collect in huge clouds that are collapsed by gravity and that form clumps that further gravitational collapse turn into stars. <PERSON> Giovanelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> estimated the mass of the cloud at about a tenth of the Milky Way, which contains billions of stars. <PERSON> Heiles </PERSON> said the relatively small mass of the cloud presents no problems to the theory that it is a proto-galaxy. `` There are lots of small galaxies out there, lots that are about 10 percent the size of our Milky Way,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, an associate professor of astromony at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> who has studied young galaxies, called the new finding `` very exciting.'' `` This would be the first time that we could see a mass of gas changing itself into a galaxy,'' he said. `` It offers the opportunity to study the process in great detail.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said that fact that the cloud is close to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by astronomical standards, just 65 million light years away, will help astronomers study it. A light year is a measure of distance used by astronomers. It is the distance that light travels through a vacuum in one year, about 5.7 trillion miles. <PERSON> Heiles </PERSON> said the next step now is to conduct a careful search for other such clouds in the universe. He said astronomers may find that there are many other such clouds, or forming galaxies. Presently, said <PERSON> Heiles </PERSON>, it is believed that vast areas of the heavens are devoid of any matter. He said a survey might find that many of those voids are not empty at all, but filled with hydrogen clouds, or proto-galaxies.

<HEAD>Showdown Looms Between Government, Labor as Teachers Plan Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A showdown between the new government and organized labor shaped up on Tuesday as bus drivers in the capital refused to work and teachers prepared a nationwide strike. The bus drivers and teachers, along with doctors in municipal hospitals and public employees in the provinces, are demanding salary increases that exceed guidelines set by the economy and labor ministries. `` We insist on a pay floor of 75,000 australs -LRB- about $ 114 -RRB- for the month of August,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 200,000-member Confederation of Argentine Educators. The monthly base now is about $ 46. The 48-hour strike was to begin Wednesday. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose traditional base is organized labor, but government and labor have been heading for a clash since he was sworn in as president on July 8. Faced with a huge budget deficit and hyperinflation, the new government raised public utility rates by several hundred percent, pledged to sell off money-losing state companies, and implemented `` voluntary'' wage and price controls. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> threatened to revoke collective bargaining pacts that exceeded 175 percent for the July-September period. Most fell within that limit, though the cost of living soared by 197 percent in July alone. Labor leaders complained that workers can not pay the higher utility rates, face firings or reduced wages in any privatization plan, and that the guidelines allowed prices to rise higher than wages. `` My main obligation is to defend the interests of workers,'' <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, leader of the 3 million-member General Labor Confederation, said. `` I'm Peronist, but I'm not servile to anybody.'' To restart an economy in recession, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is willing to make concessions to business that organized labor is not inclined to accept. On Tuesday, Economy Minister <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> proposed that as a temporary measure, businesses be allowed to hire employees for up to three years with no commitments to job security or unemployment insurance. On Tuesday, bus drivers demanding a raise of 36 percent over the recently negotiated monthly pay floor of about $ 95 refused to charge passengers. Many owners pulled their buses off the streets. Coffins piled up in cemeteries in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matanza </LOCATION>, the most densely populated district of metropolitan <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, as municipal workers, including grave diggers, refused to work. Public employees in <ORGANIZATION> Mar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plata </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tucuman </LOCATION> struck for higher pay. Butchers in <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s third-biggest city, refused to pay electricity bills that are up to 2,500 percent higher than the previous month The <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> government, conscious of the food riots that shook the country last May, has tried to ease the way for its program of economic restructuring. Private and public sector workers have received clothing allowances, one-time bonuses and advances on monthly salaries. Soup kitchens feed hundreds of thousands of hungry Argentines in the countryside. Some progress has been reported under the new government. Inflation is projected to increase by 35 percent in August, and by 10 percent or less in September. Real wages in July were about 30 percent higher than in June. The austral currency has stabilized against the dollar and interest rates have plunged. Prices in supermarkets and department stores have come down slightly.

<TEXT>
 A communications satellite that was the first payload put in orbit by a privately owned rocket was parked in a permanent orbit Tuesday by a radio-controlled motor aboard the satellite. The 2,700-pound Marcopolo I, which will beam televison programs to British homes, was launched into a preliminary elliptical orbit Sunday from <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> atop a three-stage <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket made by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Ground controllers tracked the satellite for nearly two days to determine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal at 9:52 a.m. EDT to fire the motor. <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which built the satellite for a British broadcasting company, said the motor fired perfectly to kick the spacecraft into a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, overlooking the British <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>. `` Everything is checking out very well. All the systems are operating the way they should be,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dore </PERSON>. `` This has been a very smooth transition into space.'' The satellite's antenna and solar panels, which provide power, are expected to be deployed Thursday, <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> said. After being checked for several months, <ORGANIZATION> Marcopolo </ORGANIZATION> I will begin beaming television signals to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> next spring, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonds-Gooding </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which will operate the system. Marcopolo I is the first of two satellites designed to transmit television programs for a fraction of the cost of cable systems directly to British homes equipped with a 12-inch dish antenna, a box on top of the TV set and a remote control unit.

 A huge coal-burning power plant in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> is contaminating the once pristine air over the Grand Canyon and may be forced to install expensive pollution controls, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it will determine by next February how much emissions of sulfur dioxide will have to be curbed at the partially government-owned Navajo Generating Station 80 miles from the center of the Grand Canyon. The plant, one of the largest in the country, burns 24,000 tons of coal a day and releases an estimated 12 to 13 tons of sulfur dioxide from its 750-foot smokestacks hourly. Much of the pollution has been finding its way as sulfate particles over the Grand Canyon, causing a white haze over the canyon during much of the year, especially in the winter months, according to environmentalists and park operators. The operators of the Navajo plant near Page, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, have said that costs for pollution curbs _ possibly expensive `` scrubbers'' to reduce sulfur releases _ could be as high $ 1 billion, although other estimates have been in the $ 300 million to $ 400 million range. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which is under a court-imposed agreement to resolve the Grand Canyon pollution problem and determine to what extend the power plant is at fault, said there is `` substantial evidence'' that the 2,250-megawatt plant is a `` major contributor'' to the canyon's pollution problems The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> cited a $ 2 million six-week study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and early 1988 that concluded that on average 40 percent of the air pollution over the canyon came from the power plant. On some days during the study period the plant was blamed for as much as 70 percent of the pollution. The Park Service used a chemical tracer that was released with the plant's other emissions and then tracked how the winds carried the pollutants over the canyon. `` We have substantial evidence that the Navajo Generating Station is a significant contributor to the visiblity problem,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator. `` Action must be taken now to protect the Grand Canyon.'' But officials of the Salt River Project, operator of the plant, have argued that they should not be required to install expensive pollution control equipment because, they say, the contamination over the canyon comes from other sources as well, including pollution drifting from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. While the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contends its study clearly shows the power plant to be the major cause of the canyon's air pollution problems, another agency in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, has sided with the plant's operators. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappoport </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> executive in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` We intend to test the reason and rationale employed by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the Environmental Defense Fund during the comment process and, if necessary, in court. `` At a time when the press and policy-makers are rediscovering the environment, we're not at all surprised by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decision,'' said <PERSON> Rappoport </PERSON>, who direct's the <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>'s government relations. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, director of the Grand Canyon Trust, called the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s move `` another encouraging example that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> is going to make strong decisions to defend the environment. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said, `` It's by no means the end of the issue because the major controversy _ the pollution-control strategy _ is ahead of us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 24 percent of the plant and relies on its electricty to pump water from the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into irregation projects in central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, has maintained that further studies are needed before new pollution curbs should be required at the plant. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> study, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said Tuesday he is not convinced the power plant is the leading culprit in the Grand Canyon air pollution problems. He said he would like the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to review the Park Service findings. `` We have two bureaus -LRB- within the department -RRB- that disagreed. What we seek is a disinterested third party,'' said a department spokesman, when asked to elaborate on <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s statement. Environmentalists charge that the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> is trying to discredit the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> study because as much as one-fourth of the cost of additional pollution controls at the plant _ as much as $ 250 million, according to some estimates _ could come eventually out of the bureau's budget. While the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> concluded Tuesday that the plant is a major contributor to the canyon's pollution, it held off until next February to determine how much it wants the plant to curb its emissions and by what means those reductions will be attained. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhnke </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said that with the federal government likely to bear much of the cost of pollution controls, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will be under pressure to hold down the cost of any emissions control plan. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is under a court order to impose specific curbs on the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> plant by next Feb. 1 as a result of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund. Federal clean air laws require the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to take action against polluters that impair visibility in federal parks such as the Grand Canyon.

 Developers and city officials from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, will appeal a court decision protecting the desert tortoise, which has been listed as an endangered species by the federal government. The group of businessmen and officials filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, fearing that a real estate boom in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> will be hurt by an Aug. 4 emergency regulation issued by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It is designed to leave desert tortoises undisturbed. Issued under the Endangered Species Act, the rule could severely restrict development on land inhabited by the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> population of wild desert tortoises. Covered by the regulation are portions of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, southwestern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, as well as southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> including <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, the scene of substantial commercial and residential growth. In a decision last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> refused to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the rule. The federal government issued the regulation after an outbreak of respiratory disease among wild desert tortoise populations. But there is no scientific evidence that the disease affected tortoises in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, said the city of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, which argued that the regulation should have been confined to areas affected by the disease. In his decision, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> agreed that it would have been `` significantly preferable'' to limit the geographic scope of the emergency rule. But he said nothing in the Endangered Species Act requires the wildlife service `` to limit the chaos caused to productive human enterprises ... based on geographic ... concerns.'' The wildlife service's rule `` calls a halt to an awful lot of development activity because the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> area is within the habitat'' of the desert tortoise, said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldbloom </PERSON>, one of the lawyers representing the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> interests filing suit. In an interview Tuesday, <PERSON> Goldbloom </PERSON> said some construction already has been stopped in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> area because of the rule. He said the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> officials and developers will go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to overturn the emergency regulation. One court filing in the case said the city of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> stands to lose $ 11 million a year in lost tax revenue, building permit fees and other income due to the regulation. <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a developer, says the emergency rule `` could lead to staggering interest costs'' and could jeopardize completion of construction projects. Environmental groups have been pushing since 1984 to place the desert tortoise on the list of endangered species. The federal government stated in court papers that the emergency listing `` will ... place additional constraints on ... industries ... to help prevent ... extinction'' of the tortoises. `` Given the longstanding consideration of the desert tortoise'' for listing as an endangered species, the group of developers and officials from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> `` should have been aware'' of that `` eventuality,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers.

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government official said Tuesday police are fighting indiscriminate burning and tree-cutting in parts of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest under emergency measures that already have brought $ 9 million in fines. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said institute agents and federal police began patrolling part of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle in five helicopters in early August. In that month, ranchers and farmers traditionally begin to burn off forest growth for pasture and planting. `` The area is wild and the settlers extremely dangerous. If you do n't police the jungle with a machine gun on your side, you're as good as dead,'' <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said in an interview. He said agents had handed out fines of about $ 9 million in the first 15 days of the exercise. Among those fined were farmers, ranchers, steel mills that use wood to fuel blast furnaces and 15 sawmills. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said fines will be used to support an emergency environmental package called `` Our Nature'' announced earlier this year. Amid mounting world concern that the destruction of the forest could disastrously change global weather, the Brazilian government also this year suspended incentives for large-scale agricultural and cattle ranching projects and created a special police force to control fires. Satellite photographs show that in the past 10 years the 2 million-square-mile rain forest, the world's largest, has lost an area half the size of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to slashing, burning and mining. Ecologists charge the government has done little to discourage the uncontrolled destruction. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> initially refused offers of help from international organizations and foreign governments, saying that would amount to meddling in its internal affairs but has softened that position in recent months. The government earlier this year turned down offers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to discuss swapping part of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 115 million debt for preserving <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> land, which covers two-thirds of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and is home to 15 million people. But <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said the institute hopes to receive help from foreign governments to strengthen its efforts. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> already have promised five tanker planes to help put out forest fires, he said. In just 25 hours of flights over the so-called Parrot's Beak region in southern <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION> _ the site of bloody clashes between peasant farmers and large landowners _ agents found 150 areas where the forest was being illegally destroyed, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said. He said the patrols have rescued 150 animals and 120 birds, some threatened with extinction. The patrols will continue for three months over the jungle states of <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mato </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosso </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rondonia </LOCATION> and Acre, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said. The so-called Legal Amazon also includes the states of <LOCATION> Amapa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Roraima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tocantins </LOCATION> and Amazonas. Uncontrolled colonization has destroyed more than 5 percent of the rain forest, satellite photos show. Some researchers put the figure at nearer 10 percent.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday suspended 13 players who tested positive for steroids in its first crackdown on the muscle-building drug, as well as two athletes accused of using illegal drugs. The steroid suspensions included only one prominent player, former Pro Bowl guard <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>. The two suspended under the substance-abuse policy were far more prominent _ cornerback <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, a former All-Pro from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Rams and tight end <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION>, who played on both of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s Super Bowl teams. The players came from nine of the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION>'s 28 teams. The most, three, were from the Buffalo Bills. There were two each from the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Rams and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers. All 15 received four-game suspensions. Eagles' general manager <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said he was disappointed with <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>, but `` he's still an important part of the football team.'' Bills general manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Polian </PERSON> said he would welcome back his three suspended players. `` They are not druggies,'' <PERSON> Polian </PERSON> said. `` They're not felons, they're not bad kids. They're good kids who made a mistake and are paying the penalty for it.'' Other than <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>, who is recuperating from operations on both knees, the best-known player in the steroids crackdown is <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, a backup defensive back for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears who spends the off-season as an exotic dancer. Most seemed to fall into the category defined by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> on Monday, who in turning down the players' union request to halt the suspensions, acknowledged the crackdown `` could be fatal to a marginal player.'' The league, which tested 2,200 players in training camps, said an unspecified number of others tested positive but had been cut `` for lack of playing ability.'' Others suspended for steroids were: running back <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctor </PERSON> and his linebacker brother, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctor </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>; linebacker <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, offensive linemen <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Uecker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>; defensive end <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mraz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION>; tight end <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Rams; running back <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Amoia </PERSON> and wide receiver <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION>; and running back <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and nose tackle <PERSON> Rollin </PERSON> <PERSON> Putzier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> challenged the testing's accuracy, saying players had called the union claiming they were innocent and suggesting the tests may have mistaken other medication as either steroids or `` masking agents'' for the drugs. But <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> said, `` We conducted Olympic-caliber testing that takes everything into account.'' Olympic athletes are routinely tested for steroids. A league statement, however, acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> could not guarantee the testing detected or will detect every steroid user in the league. The suspended players must remain away from their teams' training facilities until Sept. 27, the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> said. If the drugs remain in their system after that date, they will continue to be suspended. The league said that if another random test found evidence of steroids in a suspended player again, he would be banned for the rest of the season.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said fear was n't keeping her away from a school in a gang-infested neighborhood. The former first lady said Tuesday she was never invited to appear at the school. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> had criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying her refusal to appear next month at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to present an anti-drug grant was an insult to the community. `` The issue is the insult that is rendered when you're going to give money for a program in one community but you're afraid to go into the community,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Monday night. Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levant </PERSON> called a news conference Tuesday to clear up the controversy, saying it turns out to be `` much ado about nothing.'' `` The only thing I can surmise is the school board was not presented all of the facts. There's nothing political about drug abuse,'' <PERSON> Levant </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will present a $ 50,000 <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> grant for school anti-drug programs on Sept. 14 during Drug Abuse Resistance Education Day ceremonies at <ORGANIZATION> Gates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. `` My only goal is to help keep our kids away from drugs. I will continue to take my campaign to every corner of our community,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement issued Tuesday. A portion of the money was earmarked for the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> school and the school board staff told <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> the former first lady would n't go to the south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighborhood due to security concerns But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she was never invited to appear at <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>. `` There simply was no invitation, request or expression of interest conveyed to the foundation or me that I make the presentation at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. DARE program officials picked the location for the ceremony. <PERSON> Levant </PERSON> said once Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became aware of the controversy, she changed her plans to include a second appearance at <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> on Tuesday said she was unaware Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearance at Gates Street School was for the DARE event, not just for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>'s program. She said her information about the security concern came from the board staff. `` But even after finding out that it was part of a larger program I still maintain that it was inappropriate to make a gift to <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>'' at another school, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. `` Whoever did what, I do n't know at this point, but the important point at this moment is that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be coming to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> adopted but later rejected a measure on abortion Tuesday that some interpreted as pro-choice. A neutral version was later approved. In drawn-out, emotional sessions of the denomination's assembly, delegates voted down an initially approved statement after several said it upheld access to abortion. `` Some felt it supported abortion on demand, others that it did not,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knutsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, urging reconsideration of the statement. The original was tossed out, then revived in changed form. `` It was not intended to be divisive,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> who sponsored the original resolution. She proposed the amended version, eliminating an earlier phrase calling for `` free acess to services'' and substituting `` personal care, information, counseling and competent Christian guidance.'' A nurse, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, pleaded against the substitute, saying, `` Pro-choice allows pro-life. The reverse is not true. This is taking away our freedom.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woodville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and others urged retention of the original statement because of the the church's diversity and to give `` opportunity for ministry to one and all.'' The question had been simmering several days among delegates of the newly merged 5.3-million-member denomination, which had taken no stand on the issue. `` We must begin to lead or be led,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Calling the issue `` urgent, excruciating and personal,'' he urged prompt post-assembly study and action by the church's interim policy-making counsel. `` We must risk deep disagreement for the sake of the church,'' <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said. Favoring the original measure, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuba </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, nurse, appealed for Christians to `` trust women'' and give them the `` freedom to make their best choices in God's world.'' But in a pained voice, the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinlicky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, exclaimed, `` I will not obey this call for free access to abortion on demand!'' The three denominations that merged into the new body had taken differing positions on abortion, from accepting it in limited circumstances and defining human life as beginning at conception to stressing the right to personal choice. The eight-day assembly, which ends Wednesday, is the first since the 1988 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>.

 Three generals offered Tuesday to return millions of dollars in cash and property if officials drop charges that they illegally enriched themselves under the 34-year <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime, their attorneys said.

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is starting a multimillion-dollar campaign to stop the spread of hepatitis and malaria _ the centuries-old scourges that kill thousands each year in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. The campaign is to include spraying huts and lean-tos in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest with $ 198-million worth of DDT, the cheap but powerful insecticide banned in many countries. Health Minister <PERSON> Seigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuzuki </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will help pay for the DDT-spraying campaign. In an interview, he said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> begins a $ 4.4 million vaccination campaign Thursday against hepatitis `` B'' in <LOCATION> Lambrea </LOCATION>, a backwoods town in <LOCATION> Amazonas </LOCATION> state known for its high incidence of the illness. Some 93,000 children under nine years old will be given Belgian vaccines in what <PERSON> Tsuzuki </PERSON> claimed is the world's first mass immunization against the disease that inflames the liver. Some 10,000 workers will be involved in the campaign, which will be monitored by scientists from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tsuzuki </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, hepatitis afflicts 7.4 percent of the population and malaria 3.3 percent, according to government statistics. The ministry says four of every 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> residents die each year from hepatitis. <PERSON> Tsuzuki </PERSON> said the government plans to use the vaccine nationwide, in hopes of bringing the disease under control within three years. To contain malaria, they plan a five-year campaign involving $ 198-million worth of DDT, he said. Last year, the ministry registered 560,000 cases of malaria in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, up from 500,000 a year earlier. The number is expected to rise again this year. Malaria is almost exclusively a problem of <LOCATION> Amazonia </LOCATION>, a 2 million - square-mile wilderness sprawled across northern and western <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> The government plans to send 70,000 army troops to the region to begin spraying now that the four-month rainy season has ended, <ORGANIZATION> Tsuzuki </ORGANIZATION> said. He said DDT is cheap and effective against the anopheles mosquito, which carries malaria. The insecticide will not be used indiscriminately, but only to spray inside the huts and lean-tos used by miners and settlers, he said. He said <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans will help pay for the DDT campaign. During the 1964-1985 military regime, the generals in power urged poor Brazilians to settle in the undeveloped <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> and offered numerous tax incentives and state subsidies to ranchers and developers. Since the drive began in the 1970s, the incidence of malaria has risen more than 500 percent, the ministry says. Malaria causes fever and chills and a gradual weakening of the body. It can be fatal if not treated. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, between 1 and 2 percent of those who get the disease die from it, Dr. <PERSON> Agostinho </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> of the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Malaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers spent evenings and weekends to find the world's largest known prime number, even though it has no practical use, the company said Tuesday. `` It's like going to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, in a sense; there's not a lot there, but it's important scientifically to do it because the technology proves so useful,'' said <PERSON> Bodo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parady </PERSON>, one of six researchers for Sunnyvale-based computer maker <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who came up with the number. There's no simple way to express the largest prime number. But it equals 391,581 multiplied by 2 to the 216,193 rd power, minus one The number has 65,087 digits, 600 times as many as the number of atoms in the known universe, according to <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarantonello </PERSON>, another of the researchers. A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 that can only be evenly divided by 1 or by itself. For example, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 17 are prime numbers. The new biggest known prime number, determined Aug. 6, beats the record set in 1985 by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Slowinski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputer maker. The new number has 37 more digits and is a trillion, trillion, trillion times larger. `` Searching for a largest known prime number is like looking for a needle in a haystack, since only about one in 150,000 numbers is prime in the region where the new record was found,'' <PERSON> Zarantonello </PERSON> wrote in a company memo. The discovery was also announced at a meeting this week of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Although the number has no known practical application, the standard advanced multiplication programs that were honed by <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> scientists during the search already are being used by scientists searching for pulsars, the company said. The process has other applications, particularly in cryptology and in bank transaction coding. Both systems can depend on using large prime numbers.

 Teachers strikes Tuesday idled more than 37,000 pupils in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and one small district that tried to hold classes was stymied by picket line violence. Three pickets in <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, told police they were hit by cars or a bus, and one teacher was arrested on charges of blocking a bus and breaking a window. No serious injuries were reported, but the school board voted to suspend classes until Tuesday because of `` the intensity of picket line activities'' said Superintendent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguiar </PERSON>. Pay and benefits were the major strike issues for about 2,200 teachers who walked out in nine small districts in the four states. In northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a district $ 6 million in debt, 550 teachers accepted a proposed two-year wage freeze but struck to demand a 10 percent pay raise in the third year and an elementary class size limit of 30 instead of 36. The strikes so far have spared any large school systems. But the leadership of unions representing 4,700 teachers in two <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, area districts have voted to strike over pay on Sept. 5, the first day of school for 94,000 pupils.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, one of the nation's biggest dumping grounds for toxic waste, announced a ban Tuesday on hazardous waste shipments from 22 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said the ban _ the second in the nation _ was necessary to prevent `` <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> from becoming the waste dump of the nation.'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s ban mirrors one enacted earlier this year in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> ban takes effect Sept. 14, but may wind up in court. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the lobbying group is determined to overturn <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s laws. He said the state laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will produce a shortage of sites nationally to handle hazardous waste. `` It is virually certain we will challenge one,'' <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> said. `` The only question is whether we will challenge both.'' According to figures compiled by state environmental officials, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> is fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it gets from other states. When the amount of waste shipped out of each state is compared to the amount brought in, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> jumps to No. 2 in net intake. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is listed first in amount received as well as net intake. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s ban comes from a new state law that says states ca n't ship hazardous wastes to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> if they do n't allow for disposal of hazardous wastes within their own borders or do n't have a cooperative agreement with <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> has signed no cooperative agreements. The law was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the governor in May, but the lawmakers left it up to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to determine which states would be affected. A list was released Tuesday. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the department's land division, said the ban only affects a landfill at <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION>, which is the nation's largest hazardous waste landfill. The law leaves it up to the landfill operator, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, to deny shipments from the banned states. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimshawe </PERSON> said the company is still studying the list and will decide whether to take legal action. A violation of the ban is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. The state could also go to court to seek civil penalties of up to $ 25,000 per day per violation. Among the banned states, 18 and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have no disposal facilities. They are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state were banned because they did not respond to the state's request for information about hazardous waste disposal within their borders.

 Most South Koreans believe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops should remain here to help defend their country, and 64 percent worry <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may invade again, according to a survey published Wednesday. The poll, conducted by independent <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and Information, said 94.07 percent of those interviewed believe the 43,00 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact should stay. Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority, daily stage violent protests demanding the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops whose presence they believe hinders unification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians have said plans should be made for a gradual phasing out of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops because they consider <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> able to defend itself. According to the poll, only 5.93 percent of those questioned support demands for immediate withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. And 81 percent feel conditions will change in 10 years and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will be able to defend itself. The Ministry of Culture and Information said the survey was conducted among 1,500 South Koreans aged over 20 and randomly selected from around the country between July 28 and Aug. 16. Details on polling techniques were not available and pollsters did not figure a margin of error. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 to start a bloody three-year war, and the poll said 84.2 percent of those polled feel their country would have become communist if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had not helped. A cease-fire ended the war. But a peace treaty was never signed and the two Koreas remain enemies. The survey said 64 percent of those questioned fear <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may invade again, and 23 percent do not. It said 60.4 percent believe <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has the capability to invade and 66.2 percent think the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> have better combat capability.

 A government agency is no longer considering a ranch near this border city for underground explosives tests, but agency officials said it's looking at another site in the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had been looking at a site on the Buck King Ranch 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. `` I'm convinced that they are out _ out of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, out of <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Monday evening after the agency's announcement. `` I think we're through with the DNA.'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> and other local leaders staged a rally against the underground explosion testing, which some residents fear could damage the city's sole source of drinking water, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Felipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, with 40,000 residents, is in southwestern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on the U.S.-Mexico border. The series of blasts, known as `` DUGHEST'' for `` Deep Underground High Explosive Simulation Test,'' are designed to simulate the impact of nuclear explosions on subterranean missile silos. They would start in 1990 with a 1,000-pound charge and culminate in November 1992 with a 470-ton blast using conventional explosives, federal officials have said. In a letter to congressional leaders, Vice Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Buck King Ranch was no longer under consideration. He said the agency's preliminary analysis of rock core from the ranch indicated it `` was less useful for the experiment than we anticipated.'' But he added, `` We are interested in investigating other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sites, one of which is in western <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> much farther from <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> than the Buck King ranch.'' Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, who opposed the ranch site, said he would try to block funding for the project if other sites in the county are considered. `` If you do choose to proceed with an investigation of other test sites in <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, however, you should know that I will introduce an amendment to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill to deny DNA the funding necessary to pursue this project,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. Potential damage to drinking water was the top concern among the approximately 1,000 people attending Monday's demonstration. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Urby </PERSON>, a former city councilwoman, said `` We certainly do n't want this to happen to <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> _ our spring water is our life here.''

Turner is accused of embezzling $ 1,006,130 from Dec. 1 through May 22. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said federal agents recovered more than $ 480,000 in money, securities and property. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, whose annual salary was $ 28,000, had been building a suburban home valued at $ 450,000 or more, the prosecutor said. If convicted, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each of six counts.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Programs on The <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION> may look like `` The Tonight Show'' and `` Entertainment Tonight,'' but there's a twang with the talk on this ambitious channel. <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>, an upstart 6-year-old cable station, is using guitars, fiddles and fringe as keystones of programming that highlights country music. The toe-tapping sounds and a potpourri of other shows are aimed at the American heartland by <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>, a cousin to the cornpone show `` Hee Haw'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Gaylord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> corporate umbrella. `` Our target audience is you and me,'' said general manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. `` We own a home, have cars, have kids. Our audience is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Since 1983, <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION> has brought a flavor to the screen that distinguishes it from its cable comrades. On <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>, you see football helmets; it's cowboy hats on <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> has movies, but <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION> has the legendary Grand Ole Opry. <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> offers screeching electric guitars, but <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>'s music is wrenching country weepers about heartache and roaming romance. `` Our mission is to be the No. 1 source for country music entertainment and information,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who swept floors at the <LOCATION> Opryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> theme park while in high school. Some country music stars say <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>, which uses a guitar neck as its logo, is indeed reaching a receptive middle American audience. Fiddler-guitarist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> observes, `` We were on the ` Tonight' show recently and I'll bet no more than six people mentioned seeing us. But after we're on <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>, people everywhere come up and say they saw us.'' Says singer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, `` TNN has taken country music to a lot more people and I think that's good for us all.'' `` <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> Now,'' broadcast for 90 minutes each weeknight, is <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>'s answer to the `` Tonight'' show. It has music, talk, a live studio audience and host <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> sitting behind a desk much like <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. It is <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>'s most popular weeknight show, seen by up to 750,000 households. <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Crook and Chase'' is similar to `` Entertainment Tonight'' except there's a live studio audience and emphasis on country music performers, who often appear to talk with the hosts. The network, available to about 46 million households on cable systems across the country, has n't restricted itself to rhinestones to attract viewers. It has drawn on some prominent non-country celebrities in an effort to widen its audience. <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON> has a talk show. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> star on cooking shows. Wolfman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> is host of a rock' n' roll oldies show. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON>, who formerly starred in `` Adam 12,'' have reunited in a two-hour movie for <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION> to be aired later this year. `` If you can find stars who do n't offend your core of support and might broaden your appeal, you try to do that,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` You bring them in to open things up and give people a sample and they find that country music is very enjoyable.'' Other programming includes country music videos, western movies, concerts, rodeos, stock car racing features, fishing, remodeling, gardening, motor home use and a talent show resembling `` Star Search.'' <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION> was started by <ORGANIZATION> WSM </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the same broadcasting company that launched the Grand Ole Opry radio show in 1925. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> bought the Opry, <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION>, Opryland and related properties in 1983. The Opry music show is broadcast on the network for 30 minutes every Saturday night. Another half-hour is devoted to backstage interviews. `` If you're a country music fan and you have the chance to watch the Opry at home on a Saturday night, you do it,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. TNN is privately held and does n't release how much money the network makes. According to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, consulting company, <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION> has made a financial recovery since a loss of $ 6 million in 1985. The network has made money every year since and is expected to earn $ 25 million this year after taxes, the consultant said. There are shortfalls in the country's two biggest markets. TNN is not available in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and has to share a channel in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Still, <ORGANIZATION> TNN </ORGANIZATION> says it penetrates 50 percent of American TV homes and 90 percent of all cable TV homes. Says Hall, `` For a 6-year-old cable TV network to reach 50 percent in such a short span of time and continue to grow at a dramatic pace is remarkable.''

 If you would like a grand tour of some of the most treasured assets of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry, just take a stroll through the aisles of your local supermarket. The soups, cereals, pet foods and frozen entrees come in packages of many colors. But to the businesses that produce them, many are solid gold. To get a financial slant on the modern food-processing industry, consider how it has fared on Wall Street in the 1980s. The Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest investment advisory service, notes that stocks of food manufacturers, which have soared this year even faster than the market as a whole, are on the way to their ninth straight year of `` outperforming'' the market averages. `` In the 1980s, an investor could not have found a much more fertile investment field,'' Value Line observed. That message has n't gone unnoticed by the takeover artists and speculators of <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, who have made the food stocks one of their most regular haunts. What attracts them is not only abundant sales and profits, but the perception of precious assets waiting to be mined. `` The most valuable asset of the typical leading food processor ca n't even be found on its balance sheet,'' Value Line says. `` That asset is the portfolio of brand-name franchises. The buyer is willing to pay a premium price for these names. That translates into premium profits.'' For a time during the 1960s and'70s, it looked as though the Big Brand Name was a diminishing species in food and other consumer-products businesses. The increasingly sophisticated shopper was discovering that a lot of money could be saved by opting for a store's private label merchandise or for `` generic'' goods in austere packages. But in the 1980s, hurried consumers looking for convenience and reliability have evidently gone back to the names they know best. As a result, says Value Line, there is an unprecedented array these days of powerful brand names in the nation's stores. Food-processing companies are spending more and more of each sales dollar on advertising and expanding old brand names and trying to develop new ones. All this can have a self-reinforcing effect. When a brand attains high status, the large sales volume that results often allows the product to be made, packaged and sold at a lower cost per unit. At the same time, supermarkets and other retailers tend to give more coveted shelf space to big-name brands. More shelf space, in turn, contributes to still-higher sales. That is not to say, by any means, that this process happens automatically. Armies of people are employed to nurture, protect and promote packaged-food products and their names. Just imagine, for example, all the work that has gone n the past few years into `` positioning'' existing food products and creating new ones to meet changing consumer health concerns. When any business has been prospering for a long time, people naturally begin to wonder if some lean years are n't due pretty soon. But the way analysts see things now, prospects for food producers and their big brands still look bright. The recession scare of the past few months has eased of late. Even if a downturn comes, the food industry is historically recession-resistant. At the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, which is projecting a `` mild, short-lived recession'' that might drag down profits somewhat in more cyclical industries, analysts say, `` the earnings reports of many food companies should sparkle against that dull background.''

<HEAD>Church Labor Day Message Sees Unions As Bracing Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Labor unions, resented by totalitarian states and sometimes by corporate managers, are regarded by most historic churches as buttressing the rights and dignity of ordinary workers. Their entitlement to organize and negotiate contractual standards also have become protected by law in democratic countries. That point was underlined in the 1989 Labor Day message of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. It cited a particularly dramatic modern example _ the union-spawned turn to democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Similar union-backed thrusts for democracy were noted in other long-oppressive lands, sometimes meeting countermeasures. Some anti-union moves also were seen in this country. Americans `` can now see how trade unions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> unite and uplift the aspirations for freedom and solidarity of oppressed peoples,'' the message said. Called `` Freedom, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and the Role of Unions,'' the statement pointed up the union-energized dawn of fuller rights in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, long under communist oppression, and said: `` All men and women of good will are heartened by the successful struggle of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s workers, whose free, democratic trade union, ` <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>' -LRB- Solidarity -RRB- has become the instrument of progress, and we hope, liberation. ... `` Working people in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> are asserting the same social values of human dignity, freedom and solidarity ... as they work ... to create the democratic trade unions. ...'' Christianity and <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> have special grounds for concern with the labor movement drawn from the Bible and its emphasis on mutual community responsibility for all persons in it, including its lowliest workers. `` We are members one of another,'' the apostle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> wrote, stressing the duty of all to share the burdens and needs of fellow toilers, and also to uphold and celebrate their well-being. A tentmaker himself, as well as evangelist, he saw work as honorable and essential, a part of God's unfolding creation. `` We are coworkers with God.'' Sloth, termed by the church one of seven deadly sins, also drew <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s scorn, `` Let him who wo n't work not eat.'' Major churches in this century have voiced their support for union organization and collective bargaining to set standards for workers. The `` important social contributions of the labor movement'' has been recognized `` by almost every branch of the Christian church,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, including most Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations. However, labor had a long and often difficult struggle in its early years, sometimes marked by violence on both sides, as in efforts of coal miners led by the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> to gain contractual standards. But the upheavals of the Depression in the l930's and ensuing government reforms shored up legal rights of workers to organize and negotiate with their companies for basic conditions and wages. While strains and antagonism sometimes arise in the process, many company managements have come to appreciate the mutual stability and atmosphere of equity that labor agreements establish. However, the Catholic Labor Day message, while citing the union-backed gains for democracy abroad, says that `` in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ironically workers are measurably worse off than they were 10 years ago. `` Structural changes in the economy, increased reliance on imports, union-breaking efforts, and a growing shift to lower-paid, part-time employment have left millions of Americans without the protection of unions. `` For many, this has meant lower living standards, no health benefits and less security for their families.'' The Catholic Labor Day message, issued by Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> committee on domestic policy, said: `` A strong trade union movement, with widespread collective bargaining, can strengthen all of society. ... Union workers also are more likely to have a voice in workplace decisions and local affairs. `` Strong democratic unions can be a training ground for community leaders. That is one reason unions have been resisted by totalitarian regimes and why they should be fostered in democratic societies.'' Declaring that `` social solidarity and the bonds of community are weakened when the spirit of individualism triumphs over communitarian values,'' the statement said: `` Workers ... have a duty to use their unions not only for their own self-interest, but also for the good of the whole society. This flows from the fact that work is a vocation, a calling by God to participate in his creation. ... `` Since unions can only fulfill their important functions for their members and for society when there is full participation, it is important for workers to take their social obligations seriously and to use well their opportunity for union membership.''

<DATELINE>GATES OF THE ARCTIC NATIONAL PARK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This is the nation's premier wilderness park, cherished by seekers of solitude and protected by law from degradation, a soul-stirring expanse of rugged mountains, icy rivers, caribou and grizzly bears. But something is wrong with this picture. All-terrain vehicles are rumbling across the tundra, and park officials entrusted to guard the land propose removing 75,000 acres from wilderness status, the largest deletion in the history of the national wilderness preservation system. What's going on here? The answer involves a concept of wilderness different from anything found in the lower 48 states. It involves a struggle to balance the value of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wild land against the rights of humans who still live in it. Most of all, it involves people like <PERSON> Joby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahgook </PERSON>, a Nunamiut Eskimo who lives in a little village high in the <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION>, bounded on three sides by the park. `` Years ago, when people settled here, they followed the caribou,'' <PERSON> Ahgook </PERSON> said the other day as he and his family bounced across the tundra in an eight-wheeled ATV. `` We're still following the caribou. I want to continue to hunt, even if this is a park. This is very important to my family, and their families to be.'' <PERSON> Ahgook </PERSON>'s village is called <LOCATION> Anaktuvuk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, after a native word meaning `` place of caribou droppings.'' It is an odd name only to outsiders. Caribou has been the Nunamiuts' staff of life for generations. Their grandparents ate caribou meat fresh and dried. They walked in caribou-skin shoes, lived in caribou-skin tents, and slept in caribou-skin blankets. Like the animals they hunted, the Nunamiut were nomads. Each spring and fall, they walked into the mountains to intercept caribou migrating through the passes. In summer, they headed north to trade with coastal Eskimos. This is not ancient history. The Nunamiut had no permanent settlement until the late 1940s. By 1960, they still lived in sod huts. A few huts remain, but most residents now live in well-insulated prefab houses. The huskies that hunters once used as pack dogs have been replaced by snowmobiles and <PERSON> Argos </PERSON>, big ATVs with six or eight low-pressure tires. But the Nunamiut still lead a harsh existence. No roads connect Anaktuvuk Pass to the outside world. When the winter sun barely sneaks over the mountains, temperatures can sink to 60 below for days. Food and fuel are outrageously expensive, since everything must be flown in. So residents still depend on caribou for much of their diet. Antlers adorn roofs all over town, and skins hang drying on porch rails. It's the kind of life that makes you want to cut these people some slack _ and that is just what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did in 1980 when it passed the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The act set aside more than 100 million acres of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in national parks, preserves, forests and wildlife refuges. Within these areas, it designated 56 million acres as wilderness, more than doubling the size of the national wilderness system. Gates of the Arctic's 7 million acres of wilderness, together with 5.8 million acres next door in the Noatak National Preserve, comprise the nation's largest stretch of unbroken wilderness. Vast as it is, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wilderness is not as pure in definition as the lower 48 variety. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> compromised some traditional wilderness restrictions out of concern for rural Alaskans like the Nunamiut _ who, it was argued, were as much a part of the wilderness as the caribou. While motorized travel is strictly prohibited in most lower 48 wilderness areas, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wilderness system allows snowmobiles, motorboats and airplanes. Anaktuvuk Pass residents supported creation of the park around them because they thought it would keep out sport hunters while allowing them to continue their subsistence hunt of caribou. But they bridled at unexpected park regulations. The biggest fight has been over ATVs, one of the few forms of mechanized transportation prohibited by the lands act. Anaktuvuk Pass hunters argue the ATVs are essential for summer trips. ATVs leave tracks in the fragile tundra, sometimes digging deep ruts into wet ground. While long-term damage to vegetation has not been proved, tracks often can be seen for years afterward, detracting from the `` ultimate wilderness experience'' that the park strives to give the 2,000 or so visitors who fly in each year. A 1983 agreement established a narrow ATV corridor from <LOCATION> Anaktuvuk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> to a popular lake. But that proved too limiting, and in 1986, the park service gave villagers temporary permission to continue what they had been doing illegally all along: following the caribou, even if it meant driving across wilderness. Local park officials, meanwhile, worked out a complicated deal with the natives that both sides feel addresses most of the problems. The park service would de-authorize 75,000 acres of wilderness near the village and allow the natives `` wandering rights'' over 159,000 additional acres of park land. In exchange, 18,000 acres elsewhere in the park would be designated wilderness, and the natives would give up development rights on 93,000 acres of their own land. `` I think it's a reasonably fair exchange of interests,'' says park superintendent <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Siglin </PERSON>. `` It definitely compromises wilderness. But it's also a significant compromise on the part of the natives involved.'' <PERSON> Siglin </PERSON> still has to sell the idea to his superiors, the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can de-authorize wilderness, something that's been done just twice before, for minor adjustments to wilderness areas in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Environmentalists want to see a draft environmental impact statement, due out this winter, before responding formally. But they express sympathy for the Nunamiut. `` I do n't consider taking wilderness out of the preservation system very lightly, no matter what the circumstances are,'' says <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. But, he adds, `` the reality is there has to be some give. There is a legitimate problem here that has to be fixed.'' <PERSON> Siglin </PERSON> says he believes the compromise will win approval, `` if only because I do n't think anybody else has a better idea.'' <PERSON> Joby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahgook </PERSON> hopes that <PERSON> Siglin </PERSON> is right. When <PERSON> Ahgook </PERSON> was 10, he walked behind his father on hunting forays into the mounains. Now, at age 40, he loads his own five children into an ATV for hunting trips. The mechanism is different, but the point is the same: follow the caribou. Indeed, as he maneuvers the noisy ATV across the tundra, he seems to have some wandering caribou spirit in him. He sweeps his hand, encompassing a dozen mountain peaks flanking the pass. `` We go way past those mountains in these machines,'' he shouts over the roar of the engine. `` It's great. We go all over.'' Wherever you want? `` Yeah,'' the son of nomads says, smiling broadly. `` Wherever we want.''

<DATELINE>ENCHANTMENT LAKES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 These sparkling alpine lakes live up to their name. Hikers often say they half-expect to see an elf behind the next granite boulder or a gnome crouched under a lakeside larch. Wilderness ranger <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> knows better. There is more likely to be another hiker behind that boulder, she says, and a trash pile under the tree. At the moment she's inspecting one careless camper's jetsam: 10 freeze-dried meal wrappers, a penlight battery, a jar of instant coffee, an empty sardine can, a campstove burner and a tube of bug repellent. Usually <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> would be fuming, but today she's all smiles. The litterer also discarded an envelope with his name on it, so a Mr. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> soon will be getting a package in the mail. His own trash. Sent C.O.D. Rangers here in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness of the Cascade Range savor such moments as they try to keep visitors from loving the wilderness to death. Most are more considerate than <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, but sheer numbers take their toll. `` It's becoming almost what we call urban wilderness,'' <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> says. `` We manage it so much for people that we sometimes lose sight of managing it for its wilderness value.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which administers this wilderness area, has resorted to an entry permit system to limit the number of campers in the Enchantments. It's part of a growing trend. National parks, where the focus is on accommodating visitors, have struggled for years with the balance between letting sight-seers in and maintaining a place worth seeing. But wilderness areas, traditionally less used and less intensively managed, are catching up fast. A <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> survey found that 28 percent of the nation's 474 wilderness areas now limit recreational use with methods such as entry permits or restrictions on stay length or camping. Still more are considering such moves. The survey said recreational use is increasing or stable in all but 3 percent of the wilderness areas. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the fast-growing <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area promises more pressure on the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, which already sees more visitors annually than Mount Rainier National Park. `` We have a very high outdoor ethic,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` People want to do more than look at the mountains. They want to get out in them.'' Many choose to do it in the Enchantment Lakes, which occupy a small corner of the 306,000-acre Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Here, a dozen crystalline lakes sit in a basin of glacier-scoured granite, all hemmed in by jagged peaks. The basin's lower reach features trees gnarled by the elements, meadows of heather, and tarns with names like <ORGANIZATION> Talisman </ORGANIZATION> and Leprechaun. The upper basin is starker, a haunting landscape of rock and snow. No one knows the area better than <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, 78, and his wife, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, 72. They named many of the lakes and have made a pilgrimage here every year since 1959 from their home in nearby <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>. `` When we first went up, it looked like nobody had ever been there,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> says. `` Then we started seeing subtle signs of use. Then not-so-subtle signs.'' Hikers trampled a growing network of trails across the basin. Lush beds of heather became matted down, and wads of toilet paper blossomed everywhere. `` People are pigs,'' Stark says. By the late 1970s, a summer weekend could see 300 people in the basin, creating a less-than-enchanting situation for everyone. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tried to minimize damage. Toilets were installed in 1966. The use of horses was restricted in 1972. Guided groups were banned in 1976. And dogs, which chase wildlife and disturb other campers, were prohibited in 1982. The permit system was established in 1987, limiting the number of campers to about 60 on any given day. The permit period runs from June 15 to Oct. 15, and popular summer weekends are booked solid within a few weeks after permit applications are accepted March 1. The permits detract from one value of wilderness: the opportunity to escape society's regimentation. `` Wilderness implies freedom, and you ca n't get that freedom with the permit system,'' <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> concedes. `` But you could n't get it here anyway, because without the permits, there would be crowds of people.'' A few campers each week sneak in without permits, risking a $ 50 fine from one of the five rangers patrolling the Enchantments. But most visitors seem to respect the aim of the permit system. `` This is a really special place. Whatever it takes to keep it special is worth it,'' says hiker <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, 39, on his seventh trip to the Enchantments. The permits are inconvenient, says hiker <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. His partner waited in line two hours at the <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION> ranger station for one of the limited number of permits reserved for `` walk-in'' business. But <PERSON> Merkel </PERSON> does n't mind, considering the alternative: `` There would be people all around the place. You might as well be at the Jersey shore.'' The permit system is working, <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> says. The crowds are gone, giving rangers a chance to start replanting some eroded, overused campsites. It is still not <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON>'s idea of true wilderness. `` The ultimate wilderness would be taking an unaffected area and blocking it off to everybody,'' she says. `` I would n't have to go see it. Just knowing it was there would be enough, knowing that there's an area we have n't messed up.'' But there is also value to an `` urban wilderness'' like the Enchanted Lakes, she says, `` a place where people can sense what the land was like before we got here.'' It gives people a taste of nature, and if it is not totally wild, visitors can at least make believe.

 While environmental groups have battled government and development interests during the 25 years of the Wilderness Act, a little-known private group has quietly put aside nearly 4 million acres of ecologically important lands. In its 38 years, The Nature Conservancy has saved threatened lands ranging from 343 square miles of rare New Mexican desert grassland to a heron feeding ground on nine-tenths of an acre of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> marsh. And with a well-endowed war chest and a proven track record, the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based, non-profit group now saves land at an average of a thousand acres a day. The Conservancy's success is due in part to an organizational credo. It will not fight developers in court nor seek a public forum to save private land. It remains neutral in skirmishes involving government, environmentalists and business interests, using a checkbook and persuasion rather than lawyers and protests. `` We used to describe ourselves as the real estate arm of the conservation movement,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, the Conservancy's chief operating officer. `` That role has been changing, but we still will look to market-based solutions rather than regulatory solutions.'' The Conservancy's proven techniques and changing role are evident here in the <LOCATION> Carrizo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plain </LOCATION>, 180,000 acres of beautifully empty grasslands 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Home to endangered species like the kit fox and blunt-nosed lizard, the <LOCATION> Carrizo </LOCATION> was purchased after the Conservancy put together such unlikely partners as state and federal agencies, the oil industry, ranching interests and conservation groups. The Conservancy is involved in a new ambitious project to re-introduce native grasses, elk and antelope, lost to farming and cattle grazing. `` Grazing ended this April and the native grass is already coming up,'' preserve manager <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> said, standing in an emerald green island of native rye grass surrounded by the dusty brown, lunar landscape. Nearly half the land acquired by The Nature Conservancy comes through standard real estate deals. While much, including the <LOCATION> Carrizo </LOCATION>, is turned over to state or federal stewardship, the Conservancy owns and manages the world's largest private nature preserve system with nearly 1,000 preserves. Other land targeted by the Conservancy is protected through conservation easements and other agreements with landowners around the country. `` They have done a superb job over the years,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` There is sometimes a lot of controversy within the conservation community over which way to proceed in an issue, but The Nature Conservancy just goes in its own direction and does something that is a fantastic service.'' The organization began in 1946 when a special committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> split off to form the Ecologist's Union, renamed The Nature Conservancy in 1951 In the early days, the group's main goal was to take undisturbed lands out of circulation. Its first purchases were financed by mortgages on the homes of members. Since then, the group has parlayed donations, grants and business acumen into an $ 85 million fund and a national organization with 540,000 members staffed by more than 1,000 part-and full-time organizers and naturalists. The Conservancy finds land to protect through its <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture with state governments to inventory and save the habitats of endangered plants and animals. `` We look for habitats or ecosystems that are particularly threatened,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Nature Conservancy. `` If you wait until a species is on the endangered list, that usually means its habitat is gone.'' Deals can be complicated. To save a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> osprey nesting ground, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter had to purchase an entire real estate company, complete with <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> brownstones and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> warehouses. When the owner of a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> barrier island wanted his land developed instead of conserved, the Conservancy purchased it through a dummy development company. `` It created some public-relations problems with the people here because they felt we were sneaky,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, manager of the Conservancy's <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Coast Preserve. `` We did n't use any tactics that are n't used by developers, but I guess because we're conservationists, they expect our standards to be higher. Some land is donated. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kennebunk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, furniture store owner gave the Conservancy a 12-acre parcel along the <LOCATION> Kennebuck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` I did n't want it ever to be developed, but then someone offered me a deal I could barely refuse,'' he said. `` I gave it up so I would n't be tempted again.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was so impressed with the Conservancy that he went on to serve as a chairman its <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> board of trustees. The Conservancy offers other deals. It will take land in exchange for low interest loans, other properties and lifetime annuities. It will pay for conservation easements to keep land out of development. It also sponsors a landowner notification program to tell people how to protect endangered species on their property. `` Landowners usually are surprised and delighted that they have something rare on their land and they become advocates,'' said <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>. The Conservancy's non-confrontational stance has put it increasingly in the role of mediator, as when local officials and developers battled conservationists and government agencies over the habitat of the Coachella fringe-toed lizard, a tiny reptile that only survives in the special sands of the <LOCATION> Coachella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in the hot real estate market around <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. After months of negotiations, and $ 2 million in Conservancy seed money, the parties agreed to a 13,000-acre preserve. Developers will pay a $ 600 mitigation fee for each acre of lizard habitat that is developed outside the preserve. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Selzer </PERSON>, a attorney for some developers, said the Conservancy was able to show that setting the land aside served everyone's interest `` Another environmental group in the process could have made it more difficult,'' he said. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said the bitter controversy was eased when developers saw their holdings would be enhanced by the preserve. `` Attitudes change,'' he said. `` The developers thought of environmentalists as people with a weird interest in a strange animal. Now they see it as a question of quality of life.'' In addition to the role as mediator, the Conservancy has become more involved in restoration. At its Blowing Rocks Preserve on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, `` exotics,'' non-native trees like the Australian pine and Brazilian Pepper, have been cut to halt their encroachment on indigenous species and the fragile dune ecology. `` It's become clearer that not only species but whole biological systems are threatened,'' Weeks said. The Conservancy is taking greater steps to protect those systems through agreements that limit the use of adjacent lands. At the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preserve </ORGANIZATION>, the Conservancy has negotiated with neighboring landowners to control development pressures on the fringes of the preserve. `` We once thought we were going to be establishing nature preserves that would exist apart from society,'' said Weeks. `` Now we've come to feel the integration of these nature preserves with the fabric of the society around them is critical.''

<TEXT>
 The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the militants who seek to oust it agree on one momentous aspect of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s parliamentary elections: They they may well be the last that exclude the nation's black majority. If Nationalists emerge with their power intact from the balloting this coming Wednesday, overcoming unparalleled challenges from white opposition parties on the left and far right, they will have a mandate for their pledge to bring blacks into the political system on a limited basis by the end of the new Parliament's five-year term. Anti-apartheid activists say the Nationalists' promise is vague, however, and hope to force the government to the bargaining table within a much shorter period to arrange for a one-person, one-vote system. The activists have conducted a nationwide civil disobedience campaign to coincide with the campaign and have urged mixed-race and Indian voters to boycott the elections for Parliament's two separate junior chambers, the 80-seat body for mixed-race representatives and the 40-seat chamber for Indians. `` The racist elections will not determine our future,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, general-secretary of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions. `` We will determine our own future.'' The man who will decide how to confront this spirit of resistance is almost certain to be F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who became acting president Aug. 15 after P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s forced resignation. If his party retains control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant white chamber, the 53-year-old <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will be elected for a five-year term as president. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s immediate challenge is to ensure that his party survives its toughest electoral threat since taking power in 1948. Several polls have suggested the possibility of a `` hung <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' with the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and liberal <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> each gaining enough seats to deprive the Nationalists of an outright majority. In the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls 123 of the 166 elected seats in the white chamber, the Conservatives 22 and the Democrats 20. One seat is held by a member of a now-defunct moderate party. In the most recent white election, in 1987, the Nationalists won about 52 percent of the vote, right-wing candidates 30 percent and liberals 18 percent. According to polls, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is virtually certain to get less than half the white votes this time, although it could maintain control of Parliament even if its share of votes drops toward 40 percent. A poll commissioned in late July by the country's largest newspaper, The Sunday Times, suggested the Nationalists could be reduced to 78 seats, with Conservatives winning 52 and the Democrats 36. A party needs 84 seats to rule on its own. One of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s deputies, Development Minister <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, said the Nationalists would prefer calling another election, rather than govern in a coalition with either rival party. `` We will go back to the voters and say make up your mind,'' <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON> said. `` If you do n't want us, rather kick us out and choose a single, strong government.'' No polls are allowed in the final four weeks before a national election in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and thus there have been few means of measuring the political impact of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s bitter resignation. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> objected to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s plans to confer with President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, one of black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most vocal critics of apartheid. Initially, commentators said the showdown would help the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which shared <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s objections to the de Klerk-Kaunda meeting. But <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials say <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> had proved his mettle and held to his commitment to pursue dialogue even with opponents. In contrast to the tempermental <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is viewed as a personable pragmatist who will work energetically to lessen <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s international isolation. He is likely to benefit from the impending independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after 74 years years of South African rule and the increasing tendency of southern African leaders to favor negotiation over confrontation. But both white opposition parties have assailed <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and his party on grounds that they are attempting to straddle difficult domestic issues with ambiguous, evasive positions. Asked whether a black could become president, for example, the Conservatives say no and the Democrats say yes. The Nationalists duck the question. Similarly, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s declarations that he opposes discrimination have been undercut by harsh police crackdowns on black activists defying segregation laws on whites-only beaches and buses. The country's myriad economic problems also have provided ammunition for the opposition parties. Many whites feel they are fighting a losing battle against high taxes and inflation, and a series of corruption cases involving <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> politicians has served to heighten the anger. `` Forty-one years is long enough,'' said <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who is one of the Democrats' three co-leaders. `` Only a new party, untainted by apartheid and economic failure, will inspire the confidence internationally to turn this country around.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s five-year plan will lead inevitably to black majority rule and hopes to score major gains in rural and blue-collar districts with its call for stricter segregation. It has boasted of surmounting black consumer boycotts that were launched to protest the reintroduction of hardline segregation laws by Conservative-controlled councils in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> and the mining town of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>. `` The white community's right to self-determination is non-negotiable,'' says the Conservatives' manifesto. But Nationalist leaders believe their policies accurately reflect the sentiments of most of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites. While the whites generally want to ease racial tensions and win black cooperation, they also want to protect white power and white privileges, including segregated neighborhoods and schools. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> tries to cling to white domination, and this will never be acceptable to people of color,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said in a recent speech. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s proposals will lead to the usurping of power -LRB- by blacks -RRB- and this will never be acceptable to the whites.''

 Some facts and figures on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s election for a new Parliament:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHAT'S AT STAKE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 A total of 763 candidates are contesting 166 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant white chamber, 80 seats in the chamber for people of mixed-race and 40 seats in the chamber for Indians. The two junior chambers have no power to overrule the white chamber on matters of national policy.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHO CAN VOTE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 According to government figures, 3,170,667 of the country's 5 million whites are eligble to vote, as are 1,775,751 of about 3 million mixed-race people and 665,870 of the roughly 1 million Indians.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHO CAN'T VOTE:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 None of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks are allowed to vote in national elections. They can vote only for municipal officials and for the administrations of the country's 10 tribal homelands.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE KEY COMPETITORS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Because the Indian and mixed-race chambers of Parliament have little power, most attention is focused on the whites' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 123 of the 166 elected seats. It faces strong challenges from the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which holds 22 seats, and the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls 20 seats. One seat was held by a now-defunct moderate party. The Conservatives favor a strengthening of segregation laws and oppose political rights to blacks. The Democrats favor abolishing all segregation laws and granting universal political rights, with some provisions for ensuring that whites and other minority groups have a voice in government decisions. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a five-year plan for bringing blacks into the political system on a limited basis. It wants to ensure that blacks can not overrule white interests, and it wants to maintain segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them.

<TEXT>
 Not far from the gift shops and ski chalets of this crowded resort, a little trail by a little creek offers a way to the wild. Hike up the ridge, look to the east, and all you see is nature. No roads, no vacation condos, just forested valleys and the sky-scraping <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> wants to keep it that way. On a cloudless August day, she stands on the ridge and stares at a rocky knob bristling with lodgepole pines. In this exaggerated landscape, the hummock does n't even rate a name on the map. `` A hill like this in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> would be considered a national park,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says and then suggests how nice it would be to spread <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s beauty around. Give a mountain to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, or a sparkling stream to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Of course you ca n't, she realizes: `` It's all in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. You have to protect it where it is.'' And so she does, or at least she tries. The <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> are among 4 million acres of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s national forests that conservationists like <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> want placed in the National Wilderness Preservation System. They'd get a better reception in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Here in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, they are opposed by loggers, miners, ranchers, and off-road vehicle users who would face more regulations or complete loss of access to the land if it is designated wilderness. This is the latest battle in a drawn-out war over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s roadless public lands, a conflict set in motion 25 years ago by a simple but far-reaching document called the Wilderness Act When President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> signed it Sept. 3, 1964, he institutionalized a radical idea: Let us protect some lands just as nature made them. They would be places, the act said, `` where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' Over the years, those tranquil places have seen a lot of contention. Sagebrush rebels have bulldozed roads into pristine land to spoil it for wilderness. `` Eco-terrorists'' have pounded spikes into ancient trees to spoil them for logging. The law's silver anniversary is a time for preservationists to celebrate _ since 1964 the national wilderness system has grown tenfold to nearly 91 million acres. But it is also a time to take stock. After 25 years, have we set aside all the wilderness we need? Or does a growing populace in a polluted world require even more wild space, for the sake of balance? `` We do n't need any more designated wilderness,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, snowmobiler and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes multiple use of public lands. `` The land needs to be managed, not set aside and forgotten.'' `` I think there ought to be twice or maybe three times as much land designated as wilderness,'' counters <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator and now counselor to the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are exceptional areas in practically every state that ought to be left alone forever.'' In the war over wilderness, balance is hard to find. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s dark forests and high mountains fit the classic image of wilderness. But around the nation the preservation system also includes swamps, beaches, deserts and prairies; 474 areas in all, ranging in size from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s 8.7 million-acre <LOCATION> Wrangell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elias </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> to 3-acre <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a haven for seabirds off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. Nearly two-thirds of the nation's wilderness is in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> holds most of the other large chunks. But smaller areas are scattered from sea to shining sea. All but six states _ <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ have some designated wilderness. Covering 4 percent of the country, wilderness areas comprise a sampler of the American landscape: Great Gulf and <LOCATION> Lost </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, Mud Swamp and Thunder Ridge. If Fords Terror and Hell Hole Bay evoke the pioneers' image of wilderness as a fearsome foe, then Shining Rock and Wonder Mountain reflect a kinder view, a new land ethic lauding wilderness as a connection to our roots and a source of national character. `` In wildness is the preservation of the world,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> wrote in 1861. But it was n't until 1924, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> set aside the Gila Wilderness in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON>'s poetic words became public policy And it took conservationists 40 more years to get what they really wanted: wilderness with the force and permanence of law, shielded from bureaucratic whims. The 1964 Wilderness Act, enacted after eight years of debate and 66 versions, gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the sole power to declare wilderness. In wilderness, the law said, there would be no roads, no buildings, no travel by mechanical means. Hunting, fishing and camping were allowed, but commercial exploitation and development were generally prohibited. Like <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON>, the law was long on poetry. But it was short on details, setting aside just 9.1 million acres of non-controversial wilderness that had already been designated administratively. It left the real battles to future sessions of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Federal agencies were instructed to study national park, forest and wildlife refuge lands for wilderness suitability and make recommendations. The agencies lumbered about this gargantuan task for years, and as recommendations started coming out in the 1970s, the designation process gained speed. Since 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed wilderness bills for 31 states. This year it faces bills for 19 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s debate has been hot, persistent and in many ways typical. This year there are two <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> wilderness bills to choose from. One is a conservationists' wish list for 4 million acres, introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa. The other, more politically feasible one, is a 1.4 million-acre bill sponsored by <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s senior senator, Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> entered this fray as a volunteer soon after moving to <LOCATION> Ketchum </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, in 1981. Now she calls herself a `` working conservationist,'' scraping by with seasonal government work or grants from environmental groups. Last year she flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a stab at lobbying. She says she'd rather stay in the mountains. To be sure, that's where she seems most comfortable. At 41, she strides up the steep trail with ease, narrating natural history as she goes. She stops to inspect an elk track, then reels off the names of plants anchored in the dry mountain soil: sage and sego lilies, colorful cinquefoils, an ancient whitebark pine with gnarled branches scratching like claws at the sky. Pretty, yes, but the wilderness is good for more than scenery, she says. Wild plants and animals contribute to biological diversity and maintain a stock of wild genes for future scientists, who might just discover that something growing here cures cancer.

As long as an area does n't have a road in it, you're going to have a debate over it.''

<TEXT>
 Some wilderness is fine, <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> says, but you have to stop somewhere, or at least guarantee some areas for development while you're locking up others. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, he points out, already has 4 million acres of wilderness _ 7.6 percent of the state. Others charge that environmentalists are n't as interested in biological diversity as they are in creating elitist playgrounds for wealthy, urban backpackers _ at the expense of local residents trying to make a living off the public land. `` These lands belong to the people. That means all the people, not a chosen few,'' says <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, raised on an eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> ranch, says she's no yuppie backpacker. And there are more ways to make a living off the land, she adds, than by logging or mining it. Tourism is one of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s biggest industries, she says, and it's hard to lure tourists to a clearcut. In 20 years, roads have been pushed through more than 8 million acres of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s wild country, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're destroying everything that is n't protected,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says. `` If we do n't set it aside, we'll lose it.'' Both sides have strong arguments strongly stated _ if not overstated. In virtually every wilderness debate, we're told the area in question is a `` crown jewel'' of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wildlands, to be saved at all costs. We're also told, by the opposition, that locking up the land in wilderness would deal the death blow to an already ailing -LRB- pick one -RRB- logging, mining, or ranching industry. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is left to sort it out, and the politics of compromise leave no one completely satisfied. `` It's amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in the Capitol, 3,000 miles away,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says. `` It does n't have anything to do with <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> wilderness. It's who owes <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> a favor at the time.'' Whatever happens with <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> faces enough other wilderness issues to keep busy for another 25 years. It must decide whether 1.5 million acres of tundra in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> is worth more for the caribou that migrate over it or for the oil reservoirs that may lie under it Battles also loom over vast <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> holdings in the deserts of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other Western states. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> has inventoried about 25 million acres of potential wilderness and is likely to recommend some fraction of that for designation. The <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> says it will push for far more. Protecting entire ecosystems has become preservationists' latest rallying cry. They hope to expand existing wilderness areas around Yellowstone National Park and in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, meanwhile, focuses on her own wild <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> backyard. When lobbying, she argues the dollars and cents of tourism. But her real motives for saving wilderness prove more elusive, more personal. In an alpine meadow flushed purple with blooming lupines, Stone gazes at a horizon of sawtoothed peaks and tries to explain her love for the land. She talks vaguely of hiking with friends, of the world she hopes her 11-year-old son will inherit. Finally, she settles on words borrowed from a friend who has guided hunters and fishermen in the wild for years. `` He says they do n't really come for the hunting or fishing. They come for the hush of the land.'' A breeze rustles through the whitebark pines and sweeps across the lupines. A far-off chickadee squeaks out a song. `` That's what I'm trying to protect,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> says. `` The hush of the land.''

<DATELINE>PELICAN ISLAND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two female brown pelicans snap their beaks, croak and flap their wings at two male interlopers swooping down to a bare mangrove branch. The sea birds are fighting for precious space on three-acre <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the nation's first wildlife refuge and the smallest parcel to receive the federal wilderness designation. `` We see it as sort of the flagship of the refuge system due to its age,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` While we've drawn a federal boundary around those lands, the fact is they are being threatened on a daily basis by encroaching development.'' As hundreds of pelicans and other birds fight for space on the sandy scrap of land in the refuge, developers on the bordering <LOCATION> Orchid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> have construction crews tearing into old grapefruit groves to make room for exclusive golf and polo club developments. Bare oceanfront lots with 125-foot frontage are offered for $ 800,000. President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> created the refuge by proclamation in 1903 after hearing stories of plume hunters killing the island's exotic birds for ladies' hats and pleasure boaters firing away for sport <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> remains what it was then: a choice rookery in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lagoon </LOCATION>, a mile-wide section of the Intracoastal Waterway that separates the mainland of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> from the citrus-rich barrier island of Orchid on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. `` To you or I, it does n't look like there's anything unusual about the island, except there's almost no green. Pelicans will break off any green shoots for their nests,'' explained <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>, refuge spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The refuge protects 4,700 acres, but the wilderness area shields only <LOCATION> Pelican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and three acres of surrounding water 1 to 2 feet deep. The island is strictly for the birds _ no human visitors are allowed except by federal wildlife officers and occasional scientific parties. Adjacent to the refuge on the east, 200 to 225 units are proposed for the 400-acre <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which has drawn <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> as a player.

The question is: ` How do we manage it so we can keep on using it?''' asked <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barile </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a 500-member group for Indian River Lagoon interests. She worries that the condition of the lagoon will continue to degrade, citing studies showing a 30 percent loss of sea grass beds and an 80 percent loss of filtering mangrove swamps in the area. `` We have the highest species diversity of any estuary in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We can outdo <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> or Puget Sound, any of those places,'' she said. `` If you're out there in a sailboat or a small boat, you do get the feeling of release and being in a wild and lonely place and being a part of the land and the water itself. It's really a magical place.

<TEXT>
 Just 25 miles from the flashing lights and honking horns of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Times Square is a large, green oasis filled with the lovely sounds of silence. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, situated in the heart of congested northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, was officially declared a protected area in 1968 under the federal Wilderness Act. Since then, it has attracted urban and suburban residents looking for a secluded escape. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Franz </PERSON>, a biology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, sometimes brings his students across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to study `` forest communities'' and analyze vegetation at the refuge. On his own time, he visits Great Swamp `` just for the beauty of it all. Especially in the fall, when the foliage changes. On a Sunday afternoon, I often see families stopping at the refuge after church just to spend a few hours outside together.'' The refuge is open from dawn to dusk seven days a week, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>, a recreation planner at Great Swamp. It might never have opened at all. In the late 1950s, the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> proposed building a jetport at the site. But local residents quickly formed a grassroots organization to buy as much land as possible. Several years later, the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> gave the federal government the deed to about 3,000 acres of prime, undeveloped land which formed the heart of Great Swamp, <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. The refuge's acreage keeps growing, with almost 7,000 acres now protected and the acquisition of 2,000 more acres expected soon. About 3,660 acres of the refuge is untouched, with only seven miles of trails for nature lovers to walk on, <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. The rest is a federal management area, where grass is mowed, ponds dug and trees cut to encourage the breeding of certain animals and plants, he said. `` It's unusual to find a fairly large tract of uninhabited natural vegetation,'' <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> said appreciatively. Even though planes pass overhead and neighboring towns edge closer, he said, `` You have the feeling you are a long distance from mankind.'' More than 160,000 people _ most from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area _ visit the Great Swamp each year, <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. Unfortunately, unwanted visitors also come, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, the refuge's assistant property manager. By day, passing vehicles litter roads leading into the refuge, he said, and at night, illegal dumpers have left even worse. Nearby development also has an impact. `` It causes non-point pollution _ runoff from septic systems and the streets,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. With each rainfall, pollutants such as roadway oils and treated sewage effluent wash into the <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> watershed area, which eventually passes through the refuge, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` Great Swamp acts as a giant filter,'' he said.

 Toys `` R'' <ORGANIZATION> Us </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is voluntarily recalling 9,600 `` Siren Whistle'' toys because young children might choke on them, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. The commission said Monday that neither it nor the manufacturer knows of any injuries caused by the toy, but said the action is being taken as a precaution.

It said the company discovered the problem after receiving a consumer complaint that a child sucked the metal noisemaker from the whistle into his mouth and then coughed it out. The products consist of sets of five or eight solid-color whistles made of plastic, measuring 1 3 @ 4 inches long. They are identified as `` Siren Whistles'' from <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and are manufactured in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s action was taken after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of the Italian grain conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SPA </ORGANIZATION> refused to liquidate its dominant position in July soybeans. The action was seen as a move to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> from cornering the soybean market, a plan which <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has denied. `` To decide what we decided was sort of like going against apple pie,'' said <PERSON> Darl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinbach </PERSON>, a wheat farmer who also sits as a public director on the CBOT and voted for the emergency action. But she defended her vote as `` best for the farmer.'' The American <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> officials, `` Farmers want to know, who did you protect with that action?'' `` The answer is the market,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> director of market surveillance, explaining that the agency's mission was to preserve orderly markets. `` We have to be price neutral.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the futures industry, released its preliminary findings Friday on the CBOT action. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> found that there was a `` reasonable basis for the emergency'' and that the Board of Trade took appropriate action. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> also said it found no evidence of self-dealing by <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> officials who might have profited by selling off their holdings after voting to issue the emergency order. But farm group leaders remained skeptical. `` Their -LRB- farmers' -RRB- perception now is that the market's been manipulated by those internal forces and <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is part of that for allowing the emergency action,'' said White of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> soybean farmer and representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON>: `` To be honest with you, the farmers are tired of hearing you guys say everything is all right, of hearing the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> say it's all right. We're getting a different perception out there.'' The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has formed its own task force to probe the results of the emergency order. None of the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> directors who voted personally controlled a position in July soybean futures, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. When several agricultural groups said they wanted more evidence proving that there had been no inside trading by <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> executives either for their firm or their firm's customers, <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON> said he doubted it would defuse conspiracy theories. `` I'm not sure the facts, even if they were laid out, would put the questions to rest,'' said <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON>. `` I think people with theories do n't need facts.'' `` I think you're underestimating the ability of farmers to understand the facts,'' countered <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also could use other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> items but has a hard time getting them because Soviet currency is not accepted and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has shown little interest in Soviet products other than vodka. `` Everything they need for the comfort of the creature, we could sell them,'' said de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. `` But they have no hard currency.'' <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say the Soviets buy American grain with dollars that they can get by drawing upon their gold reserves. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said that a better understanding is developing between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> `` We need to look at how we can reshape our relations so we can buy and sell,'' he said. `` We need to remove the feeling that all we want to do is sell, sell, sell.''

The Soviets have an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that they will buy at least 9 million tons of grain before Sept. 30.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> 30 more days to reach an agreement on driftnet fishing or face a possible ban on fish exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The action Monday came on the heels of an agreement with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> last week that will allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to monitor its use of driftnets in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Earlier this year <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> entered into a similar arrangement. But so far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been unable to come to terms on monitoring use of the enormous nets, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fisherman complain are making unauthorized catches of salmon, dolphins and other species. The vacationing president, in a letter to leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he was instructing the State and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments `` to continue intensive bilateral negotiations with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'' over the fishing dispute. If they do n't produce an agreement within 30 days, `` I will be prepared to exercise my substantial authorities'' under the Fishermen's Protective Act that allows him to order the prohibition of fish imports from offending countries, the president said. `` It is extremely important to the international community that <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agrees to meet the standards of customary international law to cooperate with other nations and to take necessary measures to conserve high seas resources affected by driftnets,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials conducting the negotiatons should also try `` to engage the international community in urging the adoption of cooperative measures on driftnet fishing.'' The driftnets used by Asian fleets are intended to catch squid, but the nets can also ensnare dolphins, seals and salmon. The U.S.-Taiwan agreement allows federal authorities to track Taiwanese fishing vessels by satellite with radio transponders installed in those boats and also permits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to board the ships. Conservationists have criticized the driftnets, some of which are 40 miles long, for their `` incidental'' catches of thousands of sea birds, seals and other animals, as well as valuable salmon that spawn in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had set a deadline of Monday for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to act. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> signed an agreement in June that called for the experimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers _ nine American, five Canadian and 33 Japanese _ to monitor driftnet damage to marine mammal populations.

 New Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> hopes to build warm ties during his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week, and he will stress the need for both countries to do more to reduce their trade imbalance, officials said. Japanese prime ministers customarily visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> shortly after taking office to establish good working relations, but <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> also hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomatic credentials and revitalize his government's foreign policy, the officials said Monday. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who on Aug. 9 became <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third prime minister in less than three months, is a former education minister with little experience in foreign affairs. His Liberal Democratic party, which pursues conservative policies, has been rocked by a series of money and sex scandals that have put diplomatic initiatives on hold. The 58-year-old prime minister leaves Wednesday for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and will later visit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He will meet Friday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and then visit <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he plans to meet with academics and watch a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> game, according to <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to seek a commitment from <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will reform areas of its business and distribution system that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says limit foreign access. Foreign Ministry officials said <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is willing to pursue major reform, but that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also must institute changes if substantial improvement in the trade imbalance is to be made. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is prepared to address her own structural issues, and indeed we have been addressing ourselves to these problems,'' said <PERSON> Mitoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yabunaka </PERSON>, director of the ministry's Second North America Division. `` But efforts should be made by both sides.'' <PERSON> Yabunaka </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to boost its savings and business investment rates, work harder to promote exports, improve its vocational training, and seek long-term investments rather than short-term profits. `` These are very serious issues, and there is no quick fix,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has made major reductions in tariffs and other import barriers in recent years. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials have begun to say that the trade imbalance now stems mainly from social and business structures and practices in both countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s complex distribution system and ingrown business relationships make it difficult for foreign companies to penetrate the market, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s high saving rate reduces its purchases of foreign goods. Last year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was $ 55 billion, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. On other issues, <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will be making clear to the president that there will be no change whatsoever in our basic position in our foreign policy.'' In addition to forming a working relationship with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> plans to reach out to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public, he said. `` We expect Mr. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s personal traits _ young, energetic, accessible, a caring personality _ will be well received by our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s will visit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Sept. 4-6. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will offer Mexican officials a $ 1 billion loan to help combat air pollution in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> on Sept. 7, <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> said.

 A brake shoe manufacturer will not have to pay a record $ 2.7 million fine for asbestos exposure violations under terms of a settlement with the federal government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Monday approved a pact between the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement requires the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> factory to provide respirators, protective clothing and other safety measures for its 125 workers. If a safety monitor certifies the company's compliance, Friction Division will avoid paying what would amount to the heftiest fine ever levied by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for a safety violation, officials said. The agreement requires no admission of wrongdoing by the factory. Company President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> had not immediate comment on the agreement, his secretary said. Federal officials, when they announced the fine a month ago, described flagrant violations of worker protection standards at the plant. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> displayed photographs of asbestos dust coating tables, stairs and railings and of workers eating in a lunchroom while wearing contaminated work clothes. Federal officials also said the workers could bring the asbestos home on their contaminated clothing, exposing their families. The agreement, in addition to requiring respirators, orders the company to supply soap and towels for mandatory end-of-shift showers and to make sure employees' clothes are vacuumed before workers enter the lunchroom. Asbestos, a fire - and heat-resisting material once commonly used as insulation, has been linked to lung cancer and asbestosis, a lung disease If the company does not follow through on the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> will revert to the fine and other remedies, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a labor department public affairs officer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The head of a union local representing the plant's employees said he was pleased by the agreement. However, <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 155 </ORGANIZATION>, said the union was still considering a lawsuit to help the workers win compensation for whatever health damage they may have suffered. The workers _ about half of whom have stayed off the job since disclosure of the safety violations _ are undergoing health screenings, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said last month that investigators had found a handful of cases of lung cancer and asbestosis among the workers.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to merge next April to create the second-largest bank in the world, officials of the two banks announced Tuesday. Analysts said the merger is the biggest international combination in recent memory. `` In terms of sheer scale there's nothing like it,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` It dwarfs anything that exists'' in other countries, he said. The new bank will be second in total assets only to <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, ranked the largest in the world in terms of assets. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the second-largest bank in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the country's seventh-largest bank, and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION>, the eighth largest, will merge into a new bank to be called <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as of April 1, <PERSON> Kenichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. `` Facing today's globalization and liberalization of the financial world ... a bank must have a certain degree of size or quality ca n't follow,'' said <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>, who will become the president of the new bank. `` We have judged forming a new bank by a merger will lead to providing the best financial and information services to our customers,'' said <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, who will become chairman of the new bank. <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, who said they were close friends for over 20 years, said they hope the merger will strengthen their banks' domestic and international networks, and expand and rationalize operations to meet increasingly diverse needs. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and banking circles generally praised the merger. `` I welcome the decision by both banks to merge, given the liberalization and internationalization of the financial market,'' said Finance Minister <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>. `` I think it is timely to bolster the operation by utilizing increased profits to provide a diversity of sevices to customers in and out of the country.'' <PERSON> Kuniji </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION>' Associations of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and also of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest bank, <PERSON> Daiichi-Kangyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bank </PERSON>, hailed what he called a `` courageous decision'' by the banks' managements, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, one of the oldest banks in this country, founded in 1876, had available funds of 21.138 trillion yen, or $ 146.79 billion, at the end of March 1989, 9,760 employees, and 242 branches in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and overseas, while <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> had funds of 18.511 trillion yen, or $ 128.54 billion, 12,931 employees and 374 branches, according to statistics released by both banks. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is capitalized at $ 1.36 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is capitalized at $ 1.25 billion. It will be the second major merger for <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed by a merger between <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON> stressed that the deal is an equal merger, but said the two companies will exchange shares at the rate of eight <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> shares for 10 <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> shares. They said the name of the new bank will be reviewed and changed in three years because it is `` too long,'' said <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>. The bank will be known as <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in English, reversing the names in the Japanese version, <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ginko </ORGANIZATION>, company officials said. Analysts said the merger is apparently aimed at consolidating and streamlining their operations to take advantage of forthcoming banking liberalization measures in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The merger happened `` because neither bank was really big enough to fufill its ambitions on its own,'' <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON> said. Analysts said that the merger would join <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON>'s extensive domestic network with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION>'s international expertise, and create the economies of scale that are the basis of Japanese banks' international competitiveness Japanese banks are generally considered less sophisticated in many aspects of international business than their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or European competitors despute their overwhelming size, but can rely on huge deposits at home to create volume discounts. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> suspended trading of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> shares all day Tuesday due to the merger, the exchange said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bondholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> face an indefinite halt on interest payments while the gaming company tries to rise above its huge debt, company officials said. Resorts owner and Chairman <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> issued a statement Monday to bondholders of the company and its subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It has become clear that Resorts is a much bigger challenge than we anticipated,'' the entertainer wrote. `` Obviously, I am not pleased that Resorts finds itself in the position that it must suspend interest payments,'' he said. `` But I believe that it is necessary in order to ensure the long-term financial health of the corporation.'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s explanation did not comfort some bondholders. The default `` is proof of the misstatements that were made about the company's financial condition,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Labaton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who filed a class action lawsuit in May on behalf of one bondholder, <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stuyvesant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit alleges that Resorts' top officers inflated the worth of the company for a prospectus issued by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which last year offered $ 325 million worth of notes on top of more than $ 600 million worth of Resorts' existing notes. Monday's announcement `` merely confirms the concerns that were expressed in our complaint,'' <PERSON> Labaton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the wealthy creator of syndicated television game shows such as `` Wheel of Fortune'' and `` Jeopardy!'' bought the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> City-based Resorts International from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in November for $ 365 million. In his letter, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> explained that operating cash flow has been less than anticipated, `` in part because we underestimated the time and capital expenditures it would take to turn around the company's operations to generate increased profits.'' The former talk show host also wrote that it has taken Resorts longer to sell non-operating real estate assets than originally expected. Resorts President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> insisted Monday that the company is not on the verge of bankruptcy. `` From a short-term point of view, we have clearly demonstrated our financial viability,'' he said. `` And we made a decision some time ago that we have to solve the problem on a long-term basis, which involves major recapitalization.'' The recapitalization plan will be outlined at a Sept. 19 bondholders meeting, <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. Interest payments could resume once such a plan is in place, which could take several months, he said. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, a gaming industry analyst with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s deal `` probably will be an equity -LRB- stock -RRB- enticement in return for a reduction in interest rates or principal payments. Resorts faces payments of more than $ 130 million in interest and principal this year, but its operations will not likely generate enough money to cover that. In 1988, the company's cash flow was only $ 60.2 million; revenues totaled $ 456 million. According to figures released earlier this month, Resorts posted a $ 27.9 million net loss for the second quarter, compared with a $ 13.8 million loss for the same period in 1988. Revenues for the second quarter totaled $ 110.2 million, down from $ 122.3 million in the 1988 quarter. In his letter, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> told the bondholders that he continues to believe Resorts `` can become a valuable and successful company. I invested $ 50 million personally and have provided a letter of credit of $ 10 million based on that belief.'' Monday's announcement, however, could harm <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s chances of winning a permanent casino license. The state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will hold hearings next month to consider whether Resorts has enough financial stability to merit changing <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s interim authorization into a license. Resorts bonds have a face value of $ 1,000 and were issued at interest rates ranging from 10 percent to 16 | percent In recent weeks, the bonds have traded at prices ranging from $ 355 to $ 390. In addition to the Resorts hotel and casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the company owns more than 700 acres of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> land and properties in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, including the Paradise Island Resort and Casino.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pavilion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company founded by two former actors, has acquired a majority interest in <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, which in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s heyday produced such classic films as `` Citizen Kane,'' `` King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON>,'' `` The Bells of St. Marys'' and `` It's a Wonderful Life.'' Terms of the deal to buy the <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> stake from <ORGANIZATION> Wesray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were n't disclosed. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, former TV and film actors who founded Pavilion last year, will be the largest shareholders in the new company, to be known as RKO-Pavilion. The RKO Pictures name will be retained for the motion picture development and production division. Pavilion will obtain remake and sequel rights to <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION>'s 650-picture library, and <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said in an interview that he hopes to remake <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' classic `` The Magnificent Ambersons'' and to adapt films to other media _ perhaps a Broadway musical `` We want to bring back a memorable and respected name into the active production of films, both new and sequels and remakes,'' said <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> was an actress in `` Hotel'' and `` Hot Pursuit,'' among other television roles, and appeared in a string of movies, including `` The Sundowners'' and `` The Courtship of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s Father. She operated a low-budget film production company before teaming with <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> has been a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> test pilot and an investment banker as well as an actor. His acting ranged from the movie `` High Plains Drifter'' with <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> to the quickly canceled ABC-TV series `` Chopper One'' in 1978. `` The idea is to be a creatively nurturing company,'' <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. `` We wanted to create the kind of company where creative people felt comfortable to work.'' He will be chairman of the new company. Miss <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> will head the creative staff. Rights to the RKO library other than sequel and remake use were purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s plans for a color version of `` Citizen Kane'' caused a huge uproar a year later before he decided against the project Currently, RKO has `` The Narrow Margin'' in production at <ORGANIZATION> Carolco </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> starring and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyams </PERSON> writing and directing.

RKO's old radio tower-atop-the-world trademark will be updated, <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. `` We're going to redesign and synthesize into a modern symbol,'' he said.

 Share prices were lower at midday as technical pressures in a thin market countered support from Wall Street's overnight strength Traders reported no institutional buying. One securities analyst said that with the market at its post-crash highs and entering the final leg of a three-week trading account, `` people are a wee bit uncomfortable'' about buying. Others said they did not expect a major sellout and predicted that market makers could step in as buyers once the market appears to have hit its intraday lows. `` I do n't think we're going to go down much from here, maybe off 15 points at most,'' said a trader with a major British brokerage. At 12:08 p.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was down 14.9 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,382.5, its low for the day.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to merge next April, creating the second largest bank in the world, bank officials said today. Analysts said the bank merger was the biggest in recent memory. `` In terms of sheer scale there's nothing like it,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` It dwarfs anything that exists.'' The new bank will be second in total assets only to <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, ranked the largest in the world in assets. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest bank in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the country's seventh largest bank, and <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON>, the eighth largest, will merge into a new bank to be called <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as of April 1, <PERSON> Kenichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. `` Facing today's globalization and liberalization of the financial world ... a bank must have a certain degree of size or quality ca n't follow,'' said <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>, who will become the president of the new bank. `` We have judged forming a new bank by a merger will lead to providing the best financial and information services to our customers,'' said <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, who will become chairman of the new bank. <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, who described themselves as close friends for over 20 years, said they hope the merger will strengthen their banks' domestic and international networks. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and banking circles generally favored the merger. `` I welcome the decision by both banks to merge, given the liberalization and internationalization of the financial market,'' said Finance Minister <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>. `` I think it is timely to bolster the operation by utilizing increased profits to provide a diversity of services to customers in and out of the country.'' <PERSON> Kuniji </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION>' Associations of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and also of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest bank, <PERSON> Daiichi-Kangyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bank </PERSON>, hailed what he called a `` courageous decision'' by the banks' managements, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, one of the oldest banks in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, founded in 1876, had $ 147 billion in funds at the end of March, 9,760 employees and 242 branches worldwide, while <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> had funds of $ 128 billion, 12,931 employees and 374 branches, according to both banks. It will be the second major merger for <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed by a merger between <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. While <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON> said the deal was `` straight up,'' the two companies will exchange eight <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> shares for every 10 <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> shares. They said the name of the new bank will be reviewed and changed in three years, because it is `` too long,'' said <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>. The bank's name in English, `` <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>,'' reverses the name in the Japanese version, `` <LOCATION> Taiyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitsui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ginko </LOCATION> -LRB- bank -RRB-,'' company officials said. Analysts said that the merger would join <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON>'s extensive domestic network with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION>'s international expertise, and create economies of scale that are the basis of Japanese banks' international competitiveness In terms of assets, Japanese banks dominate the 10 largest banks in the world, according to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based daily newspaper. `` This may ignite a series of similar mergers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengage </PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Amid the deregulation and intensifying competition, Japanese banks' perception about a merger is changing,'' said <PERSON> Zengage </PERSON>, adding that mergers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s banking industry often had been considered undesirable unless one company was near bankruptcy and needed a partner's help. Japanese banks are generally considered less sophisticated in many aspects of international business than their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or European competitors despite their overwhelming size, but can rely on huge deposits at home to create volume discounts. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> suspended trading of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> shares today for the day.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials hope a new president can turn around the company's recent drop in earnings by focusing on network computer systems and software. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' board of directors Monday promoted <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> to president and chief operating officer, putting him in line to succeed the 63-year-old chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>. Before <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>'s promotion, the company had no president and chief operating officer. `` His top priority will be to strengthen the company's financial position by improving profitability and cash flow and to continue the company's thrust into the faster-growing markets of distributed network computing systems and software and services,'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said in a news release. <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> will handle all computer business except defense sales. <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>, 48, beat out <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, 45, for the No. 2 job at the computer giant. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> when he was <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, and <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>, a former Burroughs executive, were viewed as the two candidates to take over when <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> retires. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, who engineered <PERSON> Burrough </PERSON>'s takeover of <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> to form <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, has indicated he may step down in two years. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> was promoted from executive vice president to vice chairman. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>'s duties still include chief financial officer and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> is a key member of the management team and this promotion recognizes the substantial contributions he has made and the broad expertise he brings to the corporation,'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> reported a 67 percent drop in earnings for the second quarter. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> attributed the decrease to the expense of cutting inventories, pricing pressures from competitors and the temporary suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' defense business by the Pentagon. The strong dollar also decreased the value of sales made in foreign currencies, he said. For the second quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 53.6 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $ 2.57 billion. In the second three months of 1988, net income totaled $ 162.3 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> board also promoted <PERSON> Reto </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> to senior vice president and named him president of the Americas-Pacific Division. The new division combines the former Pacific-Asia Division and the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> Division. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Europe-Africa </LOCATION> division, was promoted to senior vice president.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is entering a period of slow investment growth, modest increases in manufacturing output and subdued consumer spending, the Confederation of British Industry said Tuesday. The organization representing big business said manufacturers' order books this month were below normal for the fourth consecutive month while their output growth continued at rates much lower than a year ago <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigglesworth </PERSON>, who heads the confederation's industrial trends survey, said companies would trim spending to protect profit margins. `` There is clearly a danger that in this process, investment will be cut back, with a damaging effect on the nation's ability to compete in international markets,'' he said. Analysts blame <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s high 14 percent base bank lending rates for most of the industrial and consumer spending slowdown. The Financial Times business daily said Tuesday that most forecasting groups it surveyed expect the interest rates to remain at about 14 percent for the rest of this year. `` Even in the last three months of 1990, interest rates of about 12 percent are expected,'' it said. `` Consumer spending is also expected to slow dramatically ... After growing by about 3 percent this year, the survey points to growth of only 1.7 percent in 1990, the lowest annual growth rate since 1982.'' The daily said inflation was expected to fall from a little below 7 percent in the last quarter of this year to just above 5 percent in a year's time. However, it predicted exports would grow, reflecting expectations of stronger economic growth in other countries. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had its second worst monthly trade deficit in July of 2.1 billion pounds, or $ 3.2 billion, suggesting the deficit for the year will be around 20 billion pounds against the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s official forecasts of 14.5 billion pounds. The high interest rate, which is fixed by the government, is a means of keeping the British pound strong in world currency markets at a time of slow industrial growth. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Segall </PERSON>, a financial commentator, wrote Tuesday in the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>: `` While we were nearly 10 billion pounds in deficit in the first six months of this year, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was 20 billion pounds in surplus ... <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s deficit is eight times as big as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s ... We are now overspending the equivalent of 4 percent of gross domestic product ... We are in an even bigger mess than the Americans.''

<HEAD>Federal Court Reverses Dismissal of Shareholder Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ruled that a shareholder lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can be brought to trial, reversing his March ruling that the claims should first be submitted to the company's board, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> says. The lawsuit seeks to recover millions of dollars in fines levied against the aerospace contractor for federal contract fraud. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> last Wednesday denied <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>'s motion to dismiss the case, ruling that the amended complaint contained enough allegations to bypass the board of directors and go to trial, the company said in a release Monday. Rockford-based <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to fraud in October and agreed to pay a $ 115 million fine _ the largest fraud settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> history. Several managers were subsequently fired. The lawsuit, first filed in September by <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and joined by several other shareholders, said company board members and some officers should be personally liable for the penalties. <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> approved <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>'s motion for dismissal of the case in March, saying the plaintiffs had failed to give adequate reasons for taking the case to court before submitting their claims to the company board. But he left plaintiffs the option of amending the complaint. In last week's ruling, <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON> denied the company's bid for dismissal of the amended lawsuit, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> said. The government said <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> overbilled the department for aircraft parts and obtained contracts by underbidding actual costs and attempting to recover them through overhead accounts set up for other purposes. On Jan. 26, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay an additional $ 62.3 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and make cost-saving concessions on future contracts that one federal official estimated could be worth an additional $ 34 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> won a temporary restraining order barring its rival, The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, from publishing two dozen syndicated columns and comic strips beginning next week. The question of who has publication rights to the features also is under the scrutiny of a federal judge in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where a hearing was scheduled today. The features, including such items as `` Dear Abby'' and `` <PERSON> Tank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>,'' would have disappeared from the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> beginning Sept. 3, had a contract obtained by the Morning News not been challenged. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City-based firm which distributes the features, has sued the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> under federal copyright laws. A hearing on that suit is set for Friday. State District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said his restraining order Monday could mean no <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> newspaper will be carrying the features and comics. `` Until the logjam is broken, that's what the result is,'' he said. Last week, West declined to grant a similar temporary restraining order sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, citing an order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> that nothing be done to infringe the federal judge's jurisdiction. At the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hearing today, attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> were to seek to have <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>'s order vacated, according to <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> officials. The smaller <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> wants to prevent Morning News owner <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from acquiring exclusive Dallas-area rights to the 26 comics and features. <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> announced early this month it had formed a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to explore television programming possibilities for some of the syndicate's features. As part of the agreement, <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> _ which also owns <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' top-rated television station <ORGANIZATION> WFAA </ORGANIZATION> _ acquired exclusive rights to the syndicate's features. That prompted the suit from the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, which accused <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> of unfairly increasing its influence in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> market. Morning News attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Watler </PERSON> insisted the federal court's jurisdiction should not be disturbed, but <PERSON> West </PERSON> said he felt he needed to do something `` I'm interested in the public rather than the parties,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. `` The public has a right to competing newspapers and has a right to read these columns.'' The legal actions are not the first involving the intense rivals. Last year, the two newspapers settled a dispute over circulation figures. According to Editor & amp; Publisher, the Morning News has a daily circulation of 354,000 issues, to 224,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>.

 Miss Piggy, <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> the Frog and other <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION> have been given the keys to the Disney castle, and will soon join <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dumbo </PERSON> and the other regulars at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> theme parks. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION> will star in Disney movies and television shows. `` There is virtually no area in which there is n't an opportunity for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> to make an enormous contribution,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, the creator of the Muppets, and the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement Monday to put at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s disposal all of the existing Muppet characters and their library of film and television shows. That's not mentioning `` what is to come, what will be created,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. The merger of the two kiddie entertainment giants will blend the colorful characters from `` The Muppet Show'' _ the most widely seen TV program in the world with an estimated 235 million viewers in some 100 countries _ into <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s theme parks, movies, TV shows and retail merchandising products. <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION> will be presented at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in a state-of-the-art `` interactive 3-D experience. We will use many technologies in doing some things that have never been done before.'' The Muppet theater will open next Memorial Day. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> refused to disclose the purchase price of <ORGANIZATION> Henson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It has been reported as ranging from $ 100 million to $ 150 million. `` I've loved Disney. I grew up on its movies... and I'm happy to have the <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION> at the parks,'' said the bearded <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, who created <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> in 1955 and followed that up with Miss Piggy, Animal, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter and others. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, who also created most of the stars of the `` Sesame Street'' television series, will retain his association with that show separately from the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> agreement, he and <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> told reporters. Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster and other <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> creations for `` Sesame Street'' are not part of the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> deal. Analysts have said the studios' park needed something such as the <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION> to better compete with rival <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, which will have two attractions geared to children when it opens next May 1. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> publicist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION> would retain their family-oriented humor and not become strictly children's characters. The Muppets' attraction to small children is primarily visual, Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` Miss Piggy, for instance _ whose humor is adult humor _ is not going to change,'' she said. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said he it was `` always fun creating new characters...

 More agreements were reached in the Baby Belles, with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> agreeing to tenative settlements with two striking unions and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> signing a pact with its strikers. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> union members, who were on strike for 23 days, began reporting to wor telephone strikk today, but a utility official said that operations would n't return to normal for several days. The company serves six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Union officials in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, meanwhile, urged members to stay out until agreements are reached with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Two other <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bells </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> reached agreements with workers over the weekend. About 200,000 workers went on strike earlier this month at four of the Baby Bells, the regional telephone companies created by the 1984 breakup of AT & amp; T.

 Prices dipped in early trading on Wall Street today after the government revised upward its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 6.66 to 2,736.70 as of 10 a.m. Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 5 to 4, with 368 stocks rising, 462 falling and 502 unchanged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Volume after the first half-hour of trading came to 19.26 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's performance, grew by 2.7 percent from April through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth rate originally reported last month. The news eased fears that the economy was slipping into a recession. The report also contained good inflation news. A closely-watched gauge tied to the GNP indicated inflation did not worsen during the second quarter despite the strength in the economy.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> scientists have developed an infrared device that takes the guesswork out of buying watermelons, cantaloupes and honeydews. After 16 years of research, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dull </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> chemist in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, has unveiled a meter that measures the sugar content of individual melons. `` The No. 1 parameter of quality is sweetness,'' <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` If you have n't got sweetness, you have n't got a good melon.'' Growers and consumers currently have to rely on appearance in judging ripeness and quality, Dull noted, but similar-looking melons can vary from 5 percent to 10 percent in sweetness. `` There's no one who can look at the outside and tell you whether that melon is good,'' he said. The melon meter shines infrared light into the top of the fruit and then measures the amount of light that comes out the side. The computerized device determines the amount of soluble solids, based on the amount of light that is absorbed by the fruit. Dull said soluble solids are predominantly sugars. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON>, a horticulturist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>'s Coastal Plain Experiment Station, said ripeness is critical because melons can add a quarter of a pound of sugar in just a few days Sugar is produced during the photosynthesis process. Melons need a sugar content of at least 9 percent to taste good, and the best contain 12 percent to 14 percent sugar. `` If you get one that is 7 or 8 percent, it's an unpleasant experience,'' <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said. `` It's kind of like eating a raw cucumber.'' The melon meter is 85 percent accurate in the laboratory, and the chemist is testing a portable version with hundreds of melons grown under <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON>'s supervision near <LOCATION> Tifton </LOCATION>. Dull developed the meter with help from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Birth </PERSON>, who recently retired. Another <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientist, physicist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, is perfecting the computer program that will analyze signals from the light detector and give a sweetness reading. Several companies have already expressed an interest in producing melon meters, <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said, and they probably will be installed initially in packing sheds, where the fruit is graded, packed and shipped. He believes they will appeal to suppliers who want to provide consumers with the highest-quality melons. `` I think we're just opening the door'' on analyzing fresh produce, he said. `` With computers and high-speed equipment, we might be able to get down to -LRB- measuring -RRB- the vitamins.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British conglomerate which publishes the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday its profit rose about 6 percent in the first half of the year due mainly to strong trading profits from its core businesses. In the six-month period ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION>'s net earnings rose to 54.9 million pounds, or $ 86.1 million, from 52 million pounds. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, which has interests in publishing, banking and fine china, said earnings per share weakened 10 percent to 21.4 pence, or 33.5 cents, from 23.8 pence, in response to the issue of 14 million new shares in the first half to help fund acquisitions. Following the earnings report, <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 16 pence, or 25 cents, to 7.94 pounds on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> did not break out quarterly results. It is not required to do so under British law. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said its board would recommend an interim dividend of 9 pence a share, up 20 percent from 7.5 pence a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Lord <PERSON> Blakenham </PERSON> said the company tends to earn more of its profits in the second half of the year. Sales for the group climbed 29 percent to 641.4 million pounds, or $ 1 billion, compared with 496.2 million pounds a year ago. Excluding property profits and businesses acquired or disposed of in the last 18 months, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said its trading profit advanced a healthy 22 percent in the interim period compared with a year earlier. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> reported particularly strong performances from investment banking, fine china, and its printing and publishing businesses. Interest charges, however, jumped to 12.5 million pounds from 3.8 million pounds, reflecting rising acquisition costs. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> recently completed the acquisition of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> financial daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION> and raised its stake in the Dutch company <ORGANIZATION> Elsevier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> to 22.5 percent. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> estimated that its stake in Elsevier chipped in around 12 million pounds to trading profits. The operating profit growth from <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>'s investment banking rose to 16.6 million pounds from 12.2 million pounds.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the spring, significantly faster than previously believed, the government said today in a report that further dispelled recession fears. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was a full percentage point higher than its original estimate made a month ago. The initial report had put GNP growth in the April-June quarter at an anemic 1.7 percent. That was the poorest performance in three years and had increased fears that the economy could be facing an imminent recession. However, more recent government statistics have shown that economic activity in the second quarter was not as weak as previously believed, prompting economists to put away their gloomy forecasts of an impending downturn. In another report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new homes shot up 14.4 percent in July, their biggest monthly increase in almost three years. The gain, which put sales at an annual rate of 739,000 units, was credited to the big drop in mortgage rates which occurred during the month. Analysts said the exceptionally large upward revision in the GNP and the strong home sales report showed that the economy was moving ahead at a healthy clip in the seventh year of the current expansion. `` This is a clear indication, if anyone needed such assurance, that this economy is not headed into a recession,'' said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The White House was sure to be cheered by the upward revision since more robust economic growth makes it easier to meet the administration's deficit-reduction goals. In more good news, today's <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> report showed that inflation did not worsen even though growth was stronger than originally thought. An inflation gauge tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent from April through June, down slightly from an original estimate of 5.2 percent made a month ago. The increase in prices, which followed a rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter, was blamed on higher energy costs. Almost two-thirds of today's upward revision in growth came from higher consumer spending than previously believed. Consumer purchases climbed at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, double the previously reported rate. Other areas of strength were government purchases, which rose at a rate of 12.3 percent, and spending for business investment, which rose 8.2 percent. One remaining area of weakness was housing construction, which fell 12.6 percent in the second quarter, the biggest decline since the recession year of 1982. The administration is forecasting that the economy will expand by 2.9 percent this year, down from GNP growth of 4.4 percent in 1988, the fastest pace in four years. To meet the administration's growth forecast, the economy would have to expand at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent in the second half of the year, a level that many economists believe is obtainable. The administration two weeks ago criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for keeping interest rates so high that they threatened to topple the country into a recession. However, today's report was likely to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s resolve to keep rates about where they are now, given the business signals showing that growth remains fairly robust In another report today, the government said that corporate profits after taxes fell a sharp 5.4 percent in the second quarter. The decline, which followed a 1.1 percent drop in the first three months of the year, was the biggest setback since a 16.5 percent decline in the first quarter of 1986. Trade was another bright spot in the GNP report. The trade deficit declined by $ 2.5 billion in the second quarter, reflecting the fact that exports grew at a faster rate than imports. The 2.7 percent GNP growth rate in the second quarter followed a 3.7 percent increase in the first quarter. However, most of the first-quarter advance stemmed from a rebound in the farm sector following last summer's drought. The non-farm economy actually grew at a lackluster 1.5 percent rate in the first quarter. The various changes in the GNP put the total output of goods and services at an annual rate of $ 4.134 trillion in the second quarter, after adjusting for inflation.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were little changed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with corn and soybeans up slightly and wheat futures a bit lower. The early gains in the corn and soybean markets reflected followthrough buying from Monday's late comeback. Growing fears of an early frost in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> also supported the corn and soybean markets, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based market-analysis firm. The summer's unusually cool temperatures have prompted some private meteorologists to declare a better-than-average chance of a crop-damaging early frost in the Grain Belt. `` It could happen, and if it does, it will definitely affect the beans and corn,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. `` A lot of corn was late-planted this year.'' Wheat futures were weaker on expectations that a large number of delivery notices will be posted Thursday against the soon-to-expire September wheat contract. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.87 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 2.33 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.35 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 5.78 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .48 cent higher with September at 73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August at 83.45 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to .08 cent higher with October at 40.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent to .80 cent higher with February at 41.35 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Monday.

<TEXT>
 In an attempt to get an edge in a highly competitive market, two manufacturers are coming out with car batteries they say will make jumper cables obsolete. Some industry analysts, however, are uncertain whether the general public will be willing to invest in the costlier product. First to hit the market will be <ORGANIZATION> GNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Champion Switch battery with an initial run of 500,000 going on sale in the Southeast in October. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's top auto battery maker, will bring out its EverStart in early spring. The technology is different, but both batteries have a reserve store of energy that can not run down or be tapped unless a switch is thrown under the hood. `` It's going to be a blockbuster,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> company that makes batteries for some of the nation's largest retailers under their house names. `` It's going to do for the battery industry what radial tires did for the tire industry,'' she said. The suggested retail price for EverStart will be $ 129.95 while Champion Switch carries the recommeded price of $ 109.99. The normal range for car batteries is $ 60 to $ 80. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustgarten </PERSON>, a financial analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, wonders how it will go over with the general public. `` It's nice to have reserve power, but you know, the question is whether the consumer is going to pay for it,'' <PERSON> Lustgarten </PERSON> said. `` It's an interesting marketing technique, but I doubt if it will revolutionize the market.'' Both batteries are being introduced at the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Accessories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Show this week. The show, which is closed to the public during its Monday through Thursday run, features 920 exhibitors for the trade in the $ 150 billion-a-year industry. Both companies say their batteries will fit about 70 percent of the cars on the road. EverStart holds its power in reserve in a separate battery packaged in the same shell as the main battery. The spare battery is powerful enough to start cars with dead batteries, but is not designed to run all the electrical accessories. Both batteries activate their spare power in the same fashion. `` If you drain the battery down, you just simply lift the hood and there's a big yellow switch you turn on to activate the reserve,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, head of marketing for GNB, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, company that has been making batteries for 70 years. `` There's ample cranking amperage in reserve to activate the car.'' <PERSON> Lustgarten </PERSON> noted that most new cars have automatic light-shutoff features or a warning signal to alert the motorist who leaves his lights on _ a primary cause of dead batteries. `` But they're not failsafe, either,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a technical executive with GNB's holding company, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunlop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lustgarten </PERSON> conceded that the new batteries will `` probably find a successful nitch in the upper range of batteries.''. Whether they can replace batteries costing half as much is another question. `` Sure, I'd like to have the added protection for free, but I do n't know if I'd want to pay for it,'' <PERSON> Lustgarten </PERSON> said.

 Federal regulators unveiled proposed rules changes today to combat the alleged fraud and price manipulation uncovered earlier this month in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s commodity futures exchanges. Among the changes proposed would be a stepped-up presence of government regulators on exchange floors at the start and end of trading days. More than 40 brokers and traders were indicted on a laundry list of charges Aug. 2 after a two-year probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the futures industry, voted unanimously, 5-to-0 to submit a package of rules changes for public comment. In addition to tightening surveillance on the nation's commodity exchange floors, the package calls for better record keeping and requires more accountability by individuals and firms. The proposed rules changes, if adopted, also would prevent individuals with a previous history of rules violations from serving on the governing boards, disciplinary committees or arbitration panels of exchanges or registered futures associations. The proposed changes do not take effect immediately, but are subject to comment by interested parties for the next 30 days before final approval by the commission. `` The message is that the commission is very vigilant in its efforts to ensure that these markets have integrity and have the public confidence,'' <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> told reporters after the commission voted to submit the proposed changes for comment.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to enter the fray over an ingredient that purportedly reduces cholesterol on Wednesday when it introduces its `` Heartwise'' cereal. Heartwise contains oat bran and psyllium, which is used in General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' Benefit cereal. <LOCATION> Psyllium </LOCATION> is a grain grown mainly in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has been shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim. Promotion of Benefit by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also makes such cereals as Cheerios, Wheaties and Lucky Charms, was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to refrain from advertising health claims for its Metamucil laxative, which contains psyllium. <ORGANIZATION> Proctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> contends psyllium is a drug. Instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ which would force companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _ the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, whose cereals include Corn Flakes and <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krispies </PERSON>, has scheduled a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at which it says experts in disease prevention will discuss cholesterol and a product will be introduced.

 Share prices declined Tuesday in thin trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Dealers said the downturn was set in motion when market players trimmed prices in a bid to shake out sellers. Market sentiment also was hurt by a weak opening on Wall Street, traders said. Several attempts to start a rally during the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> afternoon failed to gather momentum, they noted. `` There was very little corporate or economic news out today, and I think the market's lackluster tone is likely to continue all week,'' said one dealer. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 16.6 points, or 0.6 percent, lower at 2,380.8, down from the day's high of 2,394.4. At its lowest, the index touched 2,378.5, a fall of 18.9 points. Volume was a slim 383.1 million shares, down from 431.2 million traded on Friday.

<HEAD>Canadian Group Raises Hostile Bid for Dunkin' Donuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Canadian partnership raised to $ 308 million Tuesday its hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> despite a lawsuit pending in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Chancery Court, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of <ORGANIZATION> Kingsbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said it had raised its price to $ 45 a share from $ 43, regardless of how the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge rules in the trial that begins Sept. 11. Unless extended, the offer expires Sept. 15, the Toronto-based partnership said. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts' board of directors, meanwhile, said it would meet `` to evaluate the revised tender offer with the assistance of the company's outside legal and financial advisors''. In a statement, the company urged shareholders not to act until officials had made their recommendation. `` The offer is there and is n't contingent on success in court,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION> associate director. He said <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> would continue its bid if the court finds <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts was within its rights when it set up a series of tough defenses, including an employee stock ownership plan, which holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares. The company also has a shareholder rights plan, or `` poison pill,'' designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive. And it has sold $ 28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an 11 percent stake in the company, to an avowedly friendly investor, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We think we have a very good case in court and that the court will find that those measures were improperly put in place. But even if they were n't, we'll still continue with the bid,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. He said the offer was, however, valid only if 50.1 percent of <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts' common shares were tendered. `` Based on publicly available financial information on <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION>, including its results for the most recent quarter, we believe this revised offer is generous and fair,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotman </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION>, said in a statement. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, much of which it attributed to costs associated with battling the hostile takeover bid. The doughnut shop chain reported earnings for the three months ended July 29 of $ 2.1 million, or 24 cents a share, on revenue of $ 30.3 million, compared with earnings of $ 3.2 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenue of $ 29.2 million a year earlier. For the nine months ended July 29, <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts' earnings totaled $ 7.62 million, or $ 1.08 a share, on revenue of $ 89.7 million, down 22.7 percent from $ 9.86 million, or $ 1.49 a share, on revenue of $ 82.4 million for the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Major Marketer of Car Coolant Announces Program to Protect Ozone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 IG-LO Products, maker of a coolant for car air conditioners that is linked to depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer, on Tuesday announced a recycling and consumer-education program to help address the problem. `` Ultimately, we hope this program will help to move the marketplace toward less dependence upon CFC-12 in particular, and toward a gradual, total phase-out of this environmentally harmful chemical,'' said <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, company president, during a news conference at the 1989 Automotive Parts and Accessories Show. Under the program, recycling units are to be established at service centers by mid-1990 to capture escaped particles of the CFC-12 coolant, known as Freon, and allow them to be reused. The chemical breakup of CFC-12 and other chlorofluorocarbons _ `` CFCs'' _ in the earth's upper atmosphere has been linked to the depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer and the warming of the atmosphere known as the `` greenhouse effect.'' IG-LO also plans to eliminate inexpensive `` do-it-yourself'' coolant-injection kits with a high potential for misuse. They are to be replaced by `` deluxe diagnostic kits'' costing about five times more and designed for the sophisticated car owner, considered more likely to follow directions aimed at protecting the environment. The new kits are expected to go on the market in January 1991. IG-LO hopes elimination of the $ 4 to $ 5 kits will send users to service centers that will eventually use the recycling units, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. The company also plans to invest $ 1 million in a consumer-education program designed to promote proper use and recycling of CFC-12. Displays in retail stores and public service announcements are planned. Scientists say CFCs are non-toxic when released into the atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15 to 20 miles to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds break apart, resulting in damage to the ozone layer. Environmentalists say car air conditioners are among the nation's single biggest source of ozone depletion IG-LO, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, Ky.-based division of <ORGANIZATION> Valvoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, bills itself as the nation's leading marketer of automotive refrigerant. Under an international agreement called the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 37 other countries are committed to a 50 percent reduction in production and consumption of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s by 1998. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said his industry is hoping for `` a total phase-out'' of CFC-containing coolants by the turn of the century. The industry may be forced to address the question sooner than that, as several states and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are considering restrictions or bans on CFC-containing products, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, is lobbying to phase out the use of CFCs completely by 1995, <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office. IG-LO's new program `` sounds basically good,'' <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said. `` Certainly the recycling thing is a good thing to do. With something like 100 million cars on the road today ... unless we do something, that's potentially the biggest source of chlorofluorocarbons.''

<HEAD>Consumers to Get Refunds for Recalled Toy Gun</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A manufacturer has agreed to give refunds to people who bought a pistol-shaped juice container for children that has been recalled, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Mackie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, reached an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> early this month to recall the toy, called Chilly Bang Bang. It had sold 578,688 of them in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between April and June. The federal and state agreements were based on a plastic piece on the toy that could choke young children. However, the company agreed to discontinue sales on June 2 because of complaints about teaching children to put guns in their mouths. The agreement released by the attorney general's office said the product's wrapper pictures a boy with the barrel of the Chilly Bang Bang in his mouth, and the directions, `` Twist Tip of Barrel. Squeeze and Drink!'' A three-eighths of an inch, plastic piece must be removed from the barrel before drinking the liquid inside. `` This plastic piece is easily broken off the barrel when twisted or bitten by a child,'' the attorney general's office said. `` This circular plastic piece, because of its size, can be aspirated by a child under the age of three and thus presents a choking hazard.'' After the soft drink is gone, the container can be used as a water gun. <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>, which admitted no wrongdoing, has agreed to immediately stop selling or distributing Chilly Bang Bang in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It also will direct its wholesale customers to pull the product from their shelves; display a poster about the choking hazard; run advertisements in local papers; and give refunds to customers who return the product. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersing </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said those provisions were not included in the federal agreement. <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> also must file an affidavit in 180 days detailing its compliance with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> agreement. The product also was sold in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.

 The dollar fell sharply in active trading Tuesday despite favorable government reports on the economy. Gold prices rose as a result. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 363.60 a troy ounce, up $ 3.60 from late Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 362 an ounce, up $ 3. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's selloff in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad largely to sentiment that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had been overbought. Many traders stocked up on dollars Monday in anticipation of a favorable revision to the second-quarter gross national product report, which is the broadest measure of economic growth. The government said Tuesday that the economy grew at a healthy 2.7 percent annual rate in the spring. The GNP revision was far higher than the previously estimated 1.7 percent rate but also in line with market expectations. `` You buy on rumor and sell on fact,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior currency trader for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` What happened was the market just squared up and dumped.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Stellar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its Japanese-backed rival, <ORGANIZATION> Ardent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, are expected to announce a merger Wednesday of two of the top makers of expensive graphics minisupercomputers, according to sources close to the deal. The companies, which normally steer clear of each other, have called a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that will be attended by chief executives of both companies. Sources close to the deal said both privately held companies are losing money and are hoping that by uniting they will be able to stave off mounting competition from other rivals, particularly <ORGANIZATION> Silicon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Computers made by <ORGANIZATION> Ardent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stellar </ORGANIZATION> have list prices of roughly $ 100,000 and can be used by only one person at a time, usually a highly paid scientist or engineer, so they have a limited market Sales of each company are about $ 20 million a year. Graphics minisupercomputers are used for jobs that require heavy calculation and detailed, three-dimensional displays, such as analyzing the way air flows over turbine blades in jet engines or the molecular structure of pharmaceuticals. Ardent and Stellar are remarkably similar, both founded a month apart at the end of 1985 and both having about 210 employees. The biggest difference is that Ardent has the backing of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kubota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of tractors and industrial equipment, which is a more patient investor than most American venture capitalists. <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> owns about 44 percent of Ardent. It was not clear Tuesday how much it will own of the combined companies. A source familiar with the deal said the combined company probably would try to save money by merging the two product lines, combining the chip design used by Ardent with the graphics system used by Stellar. That could be bad for Stellar's current customers, because their software would not run on the Ardent chip. Stellar is based in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and is headed by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Poduska </PERSON>, its founder, chairman and chief executive.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Collapse On Signs Of Easing Miners' Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices collapsed Tuesday, possibly spelling the end of a dramatic month-long rally amid signs that copper miners' strikes in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> may be nearing settlement On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures soared the permitted daily limit on rumors of a possible deal to send bacon meat to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>; coffee futures rallied for a second day; grains and soybeans were mixed; and oil futures were mixed. Copper futures settled 7.15 cents to 7.7 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 1.28 a pound. `` The market just ran out of people who wanted to buy it,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It had gotten pretty high.'' Copper futures contracts had risen more than 22 percent in value from July 31 through last Friday, when the bull move peaked with the September contract at $ 1.368 a pound. The rally had been fueled by fears of tight supplies, based largely on strikes at the <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and a nationwide Peruvian copper miners' strike that began on Aug. 14. But supply fears eased Tuesday after <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> confirmed it had resumed negotiations with workers aimed at settling a 56-day-old strike and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s second-largest copper mine was reported operating at full capacity following a failed attempt to expand the copper strike into a general work stoppage. The market had begun its downhill run earlier in the day after the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> announced in a weekly report that stocks of copper warehoused for delivery against <ORGANIZATION> LME </ORGANIZATION> futures contracts had risen by 3,325 tons last week to 80,625. Traders had expected the report to show a slight decrease. Analysts said copper prices were ripe for a downturn. `` The market had rallied so sharply ... it needed a correction or some profit-taking,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, senior metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the move had created a technical chart formation known as a `` two-day island top,'' which frequently signals the end of a bull run. `` This could be just a long overdue correction to an overbought situation, but then again it could indicate a top,'' said <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>. In precious-metals trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 3.20 to $ 4.20 higher with October at $ 365.50 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to .02 cent lower with September at $ 5.093 a troy ounce. Frozen pork-belly futures skyrocketed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on unconfirmed rumors that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was looking to ship surplus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork bellies to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The nation's stockpile of frozen pork bellies, the part of the hog from which bacon is made, has been running at near-record levels all year, and pork-belly prices dipped earlier this month to about 24 cents a pound, a 17-year low. The runup in pork-belly prices spilled over to the livestock futures markets. Live cattle settled .10 cent to .53 cent higher with September at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent higher with September at 82.87 cents a pound; live hogs were .53 cent to 1.05 cents higher with October at 41.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with February at 43.10 cents a pound. Coffee futures rose sharply for a second day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where analysts said the market was due for a technical correction Coffee settled 1.57 cents to 3.13 cents higher with September at 85.38 cents a pound. Soybean futures finished moderately higher in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by a government report showing less improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean crop than traders had expected. Wheat futures closed lower amid expectations that a large number of delivery notices will be posted Thursday against the soon-to-expire September contract, and corn futures finished nearly unchanged. Wheat settled 4 cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 3.84 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.32 a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 1.34 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 5.81 \ On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil was unchanged to 12 cents lower with September at $ 17.77 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent lower to .49 cent higher with September at 52.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .60 cent lower to .75 cent higher with September at 54.40 cents a gallon.

 The stock market declined broadly Tuesday in a session first lacking in direction but later dominated by program traders. Airline issues moved up sharply, boosted by continued takeover speculation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.73 to 2,726.63. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a margin of about 4-to-3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 869 down, 640 up and 486 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 175.21 million shares, up from 131.18 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 205.52 million shares. Prices drifted in a narrow range until the early afternoon, when program traders moved into the market and began selling. The Dow Jones industrial average skidded about 38 points before stabilizing late in the session. `` There was no real driving thrust other than the programs,'' said market analyst <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It did kick the stuffing out of the turkey,'' he said of the programmed selloff. The market shrugged off the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's performance, grew by 2.7 percent from April through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth rate originally reported last month The news eased fears that the economy was slipping into a recession. The report also contained good news about inflation. A closely-watched gauge tied to the GNP indicated inflation did not worsen during the second quarter despite the strength in the economy. But the GNP report `` was a non-event'' on Wall Street, said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said many traders stayed on the sidelines awaiting Friday's release of unemployment figures for August The financial markets will look at the numbers for clues on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might relax interest rates. Airline stocks were the stars of the session. AMR, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, was rumored to be a takeover target and shot up 10 \ to 91 -LCB- as investors scooped up the company's stock before a possible bid could emerge <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> was also up, rising 2 -LCB- to 83. However the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting an unwanted bid from investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, tumbled 4 \ to 277 Drug stocks were active after the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would withdraw approval for a generic version of the blood-pressure medicine Dyazide manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> skidded 6 -RCB- to 19 -LCB- in American Stock Exchange trading, but other drug companies, including those selling competing brands of Dyazide, were up <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 42 -RCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. The most actively-traded issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Utilities, off -LRB- at 31 -RCB-. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 15.313 billion, or 0.45 percent, in value.

 <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, is retiring as an employee and company officer, the aerospace contractor announced Tuesday. <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, 67, will remain chairman of the board. `` In order to assist in the orderly transition of management and respnsibilities, Mr. <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> will act as a consultant to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonecipher </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the company, for one year beginning October 1989 and will continue as a member of the board of directors serving as its chairman,'' the company said in a statement. O'Hare started as an engineering and marketing trainee for <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> in 1950. He rose through the ranks, and was appointed chairman of the board on Jan. 1. His retirement is not related to <ORGANIZATION> Sunstrand </ORGANIZATION>'s legal problems, said spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON>. `` Absolutely not related at all,'' said <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON>. `` He's 67, which makes him two years beyond the normal retirement date.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>, based in this northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city, pleaded guilty to federal contract fraud last October and agreed to pay a $ 115 million fine _ the largest fraud settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> history. Several managers were subsequently fired. The government said <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> overbilled the department for aircraft parts and obtained contracts by underbidding actual costs and attempting to recover them through overhead accounts set up for other purposes. On Jan. 26, <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay an additional $ 62.3 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and make cost-saving concessions on future contracts that one federal official estimated could be worth an additional $ 34 million.

<TEXT>
 The $ 2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> supermarket chains was kept on hold Tuesday by a judge who allowed the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attorney general to post a nominal $ 10,000 bond while appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the merger. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said he believes, along with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, that the state has a good chance to win its fight to block the merger. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> contends that reduced competition from the merger would cost <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> shoppers $ 400 million a year. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which owns both chains, says increased efficiency from the consolidation would save customers $ 50 million to $ 60 million a year. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said the evidence so far indicates that the merger of the supermarket giants _ Lucky is the state's biggest chain, <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> the fourth-largest _ would cause irreparable harm to consumers. Although he earlier ordered a $ 16.2 million bond, <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> said the case has changed radically in recent weeks and that the $ 8 million bond proposed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> was unnecessary. He alluded to briefs filed by Chief Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordin </PERSON>, who said the state could afford a $ 10,000 bond and no more to ensure that the litigation goes forward. Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, argued that the company would lose millions if the lawsuit was delayed further and if, ultimately, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to review it. In her ruling last week, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said there was a fair prospect the appeal would succeed before the high court. But she later ordered <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> to post a reasonable bond. Alpha Beta and Lucky, which have a total of 550 stores, plan to combine their operations under the Lucky banner. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved the merger. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, in a suit claiming violation of federal antitrust law, contended that the merged chain would dominate the marketplace in many areas and lead to higher prices.

 Leadership by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has helped reduce income taxes all over the world, a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for economic policy, compiled a list of 86 countries, showing that 55 have lowered their top rates since 1985. Only two _ <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> _ have increased them. The 29 others have kept the same rate. Some have enacted reductions that have not yet gone into effect, he added. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the highest rate has gone down to 50 percent from 70 percent, and in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to 56.8 percent from 60 percent. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> remained steady at 60 percent. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> pointed out that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s reductions had started earlier, from higher rates than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> went down to 50 percent from 65 percent. `` There's no way of explaining these policies except by the leadership of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview. The top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate went down to 28 percent from 50 percent. He called rates over 50 percent `` confiscatory,'' saying, `` they only serve to justify high rates on lower incomes.'' `` When someone with a low income pays 25 percent, it's consoling to think that the fellow with millions is paying 90 percent,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. He said high rates encourage people and money to leave a country, discourage effort and do not increase total revenues. The southern African republic of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries, has the highest top rate of the 86 on his list It dropped only to 75 percent from the 80 percent of 1985. The average Zambian earned $ 240 in 1987. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> cautioned that the top rate is applied to very different incomes in different countries. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, for example, the 40 percent rate is charged on incomes over $ 13,170. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, almost next door, that is also the top rate, but it is applied only on incomes of $ 500,000 in a country where the average income in 1987 was $ 780. `` You should get as close as possible to a flat rate,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said, adding that he would favor a flat rate for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A flat rate charges the same percentage against all income, high or low. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system was designed as a progressive tax, based on the taxpayer's ability to pay, with higher rates on higher incomes. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, where he said the 10 percent rate _ the lowest on his list _ is a flat rate. Many governments, unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, rely for their revenues more on sales taxes than on income taxes. He pointed out that his figures do not include social security taxes, taxes for health services and local income taxes. The top federal rate in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, for example, is only 29 percent but in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> the total tax burden can reach 49.1 percent, he calculated. His figures were drawn from tax guides issued by two international accounting firms, Price Waterhouse and <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>. They were first published in a table in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.

<HEAD>Founder Of KKR, World's Largest Buyout Firm, Sues Former Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the founders of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest corporate buyout firm, sued his former partners Tuesday, claiming they enriched themselves at his expense. In a 23-page complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the state's trial-level court, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> alleges that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> sharply cut back on his stake in several companies they had acquired jointly through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm. `` We are saddened that Mr. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> felt it necessary to sue his partners and <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>,'' a spokesman for <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe he is wrong both as to the facts and his interpretation of the agreement between us, and we fully expect to prevail in court.'' <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>, 64, resigned in 1987 from the firm he helped found in 1976, citing philosophical differences with his former partners. He remained a limited partner in the firm, which removed him from managerial duties but enabled him to continue to participate as an investor in <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> deals. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>'s suit contends his former partners used the opportunity presented by several refinancings of old deals to declare them new transactions under the terms of their agreement and to reduce his ownership position. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> charges that in doing so, his former partners have breached their ethical and fiduciary duties. His suit also suggests that his former partners identified certain deals that were lucrative and then increased their stake in those deals at the expense of investors whose money they were managing. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s investors include a number of state and corporate pension funds, who might feel they also were shortchanged should <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s accusations be found true <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> now runs his own investment firm. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> has raised billions of dollars for corporate takeovers. Its most spectacular deal was the $ 25 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, completed earlier this year. The deal was the largest ever. In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the target company are used as collateral to raise the money needed to buy all the firm's stock, transforming it into a private company.

 A federal judge has rejected a complaint filed by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> alleging that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' contracts governing travel agents' use of its computerized reservations system violated antitrust laws, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. In a decision handed down Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dismissed the claims of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s System One computerized reservations system that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> exercised monopoly power and acted in restraint of trade in its contracts with 21 travel agencies, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said. Telephone calls late Tuesday to <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Houston-based System One, were not returned. In his decision, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> noted that `` the record bears no evidence of any substance that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s Apollo -LRB- computerized reservations system -RRB- contracts and marketing practices suppress or destroy competition, control prices or otherwise constitute an unreasonable restraint on trade.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, identified 12 cities, including <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, in which <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s Apollo system has a leading share of the market, but <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said there were no anti-competitive practices by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> in those markets. `` United is delighted that the court has spoken so clearly and forcefully to validate the legality of our contracts to provide computerized reservations services to retail travel agents,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoenicke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president and general counsel. United is a division of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Agreement Will Get WPPSS Back To The Bond Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An agreement announced Tuesday will allow the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with a temporarily derailed sale of $ 450 million in bonds. The sale is expected to take place the week of Sept. 11, said a news release from <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. The sale had been scheduled for last week. However, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> claimed in an 11th-hour memo it had a lien on proceeds from the bonds and the sale was postponed. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> estimates it could save $ 70 million to $ 80 million a year over 30 years by refinancing high-interest bonds through the new bonds. The $ 450 million is a first installment of the plan to eventually refinance some $ 2 billion worth of bonds bearing interest rates of 10 to 15 percent. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> hopes to sell the new bonds at interest rates of 7 to 8 percent. Until this year, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> had been effectively barred from approaching the bond market because of a 1983 default on $ 2.25 billion worth of bonds sold to finance <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> nuclear power projects Nos. 4 and 5. It was the largest default in municipal bond history. The supply system lost its bond ratings after the default, though it continued to make bond payments, with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, on bonds sold to finance its other three nuclear power plants, Nos. 1, 2 and 3. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> regained bond ratings from <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the two main credit-rating agencies, after a trial last year tentatively resolved the default case. The $ 450 million sale is on bonds sold to finance WPPSS plants Nos. 1 and 3. Those plants are `` twins'' of the defaulted plants, Nos. 4 and 5, and there is a separate legal action over joint financing of those plants called the `` cost sharing'' case. As `` twins,'' the plants shared certain mechanical systems. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, as trustee for WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5 bondholders, claims some costs for Nos. 1 and 3 were inappropriately billed to Nos. 4 and 5. The agreement announced Tuesday was formalized in an order signed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who has been hearing the WPPSS cases. The agreement provides for <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to release any claim against proceeds of the refinancing sale. In return, <PERSON> Bonneville </PERSON> agreed to a stronger guarantee that it would pay any settlement eventually ordered in the cost-sharing case. Under a complicated arrangement, <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> has essentially assumed the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> debts on plants 1, 2 and 3. It did not assume responsibility for the debts on Nos. 4 and 5. Tuesday's agreement does not affect or settle the cost-sharing litigation. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s. One plant, No. 2, located at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in southcentral <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is operating. Nos. 1 and 3 were mothballed unfinished and there is little likelihood they will be completed. Nos. 4 and 5 were abandoned after the $ 2.25 billion had been invested.
