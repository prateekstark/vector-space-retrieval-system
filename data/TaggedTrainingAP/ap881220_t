<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> was arrested on Wednesday and charged with inciting mutiny in a deepening political crisis in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> state, the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and the agency quoted Public Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter-Wright </PERSON> as saying additional charges would be levied against him. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> acted to remove <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> from office for his failed attempt two days earlier to form an interim government pending national elections in February. Legislators accused him of treason, gross misconduct and other major offenses. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> tried last Friday to dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and to dismiss elected Prime Minister <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> and replace with <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON>'s nephew, flamboyant, Australian-educated politician <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> has been in power since <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, formerly known as the New Hebrides and under Anglo-French rule, became independent in 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> AAP </ORGANIZATION> said the president was charged during a five-minute appearance at <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION>'s Court. It said Senior Magistrate <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcinski </PERSON> asked the president if he had anything to say, and he replied: `` Your Honor, I would like to see my lawyer first.'' The president, clad in a sport shirt and shorts, waved to spectators as he walked from the court and was led away to a police vehicle, guarded by about 12 uniformed officers, the <ORGANIZATION> AAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Four members of the abortive interim government, including <PERSON> Sope </PERSON>, already have been charged with sedition. All five men are scheduled to apply for bail later Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The crisis culminates a yearlong power struggle between <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sope </PERSON>, whose foes blamed him for recent outbreaks of violence in his bid for leadership. This island nation of 130,000 people lies 1,200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Says Joe Kennedy Tussled With Him After Near-Collision</HEAD>

 A teen-ager complained to police that Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> pushed him Tuesday and struck his head against a car after the two were involved in a near-collision, but the youth later said he would drop charges. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, 17, said he would not pursue his complaint against <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> because the congressman had apologized. <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said he was not hurt. <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said he filed assault and battery charges in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> Tuesday but would drop them Wednesday. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> came over to my house and he apologized and I accepted his apology,'' <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening. A spokesman for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had sternly reprimanded the teen-ager for speeding after the near-accident but had not hit him. He said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> visited the teen-ager later to `` clarify matters'' but that he did not apologize for anything. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> could not say whether <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had pushed <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 36, was elected last month to his second term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He is the eldest son of the late Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and a nephew of the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and of Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Santry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> filed a complaint saying that he was driving up a hill in the city's <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> neighborhood about 12:40 p.m. Tuesday and passed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s car. Both drivers veered off the road to avoid a collision, the complaint said. `` Both parties got out of their cars and the suspect then grabbed the victim and pushed him into the victim's car,'' <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>'s complaint said. `` The victim's head hit the car.'' <PERSON> Santry </PERSON> said police would not pursue such as case unless <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> filed a complaint in court, and he could confirm only that a complaint was filed at the police station. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said that as the father of two young boys who play in the neighborhood, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was upset at the sight of the speeding car. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>'s car forced the congressman's off the road. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> gave a very stern reprimand to the young man driving the other vehicle,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. He said the boy and his father later met with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` After hearing <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s side, the father and the son were going to withdraw the complaint,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. A man answering the telephone at the boy's home said he was <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>'s father but would not comment and would not give his name.

<HEAD>Survey Finds New Yorkers Are Dissatisfied Boosters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Most New Yorkers have low opinions of their schools, subways, public safety and race relations _ but they would overwhelmingly recommend the city as a place to live, according to a survey released Tuesday. The survey by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> found 64 percent of those interviewed were dissatisfied with street safety, 60 percent with the subways, 55 percent with the public schools and just over 50 percent with race relations. But 77 percent would recommend the city to a friend and more than 80 percent would recommend their neighborhoods. In unveiling some preliminary findings, the university's graduate school said the survey was the first of what will be an annual poll about the makeup of the city that can be used for guidance by government and private policy makers. It would help bridge the 10-year gap between federal censuses and go beyond the census by including such data as religion and attitudes about social and political issues, the university said. Survey takers conducted telephone interviews in English or Spanish with 1,470 adult residents of the city during the summer and fall. They reported a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Some other findings of the survey: _ Sixty percent of the respondents grew up in homes where languages other than English were spoken _ Seventy percent want the city to spend more on bilingual education and a like percentage go along with legal abortion _ Three out of 10 know someone who has AIDS or AIDS-related complex

 `` A Very Brady Christmas,'' CBS' reunion of the 1970s sitcom family that lived on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, was this season's top-rated made-for-TV movie and gave <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> a Christmas gift _ a break from third place in the ratings. It was the first time this season that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> finished out of last place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week, and `` The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. But `` A Very Brady Christmas,'' broadcast Sunday, was last week's No 2 prime-time show, with a 25.1 rating and a 39 share, lifting <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> to second place over <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, where `` The Brady Bunch'' ran from 1969-1974. Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The rest of the top 10 were: `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, tied with `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s average prime-time rating last week was 15.4. CBS had 13.1 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 11.8. `` ABC World News Tonight'' won the close news race with an average rating of 11.0 and a 20 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' got out of third, possibly due to anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>'s travels to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and had a 10.9 and 20, edging the `` CBS Evening News,'' with a 10.7 and 19. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Midnight Caller'' episode that drew fire from homosexual rights groups because of its storyline about a man with AIDS purposely engaging in high-risk sex, ranked 33rd, about what it has been ranking this season. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> began a guest-star stint on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Wiseguy,'' boosting the crime drama to 32nd place.

<HEAD>Judge Effectively Cuts Gay Rights Issue From Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge has rejected the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to join a lawsuit over the forced cancellation of the 1988 Gay Rodeo National Championship, effectively removing gay rights as an issue in the dispute. In denying the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s motion, the judge determined the issue that has pitted conservative residents against homosexual organizers was not civil rights, said <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON>. `` There was an effort to make this some kind of gay rights forum. They wanted to turn this into a three-ring circus. But it did n't work The judge said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> ca n't play,'' <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said her group was giving up despite the outcome of Monday's hearing before District Judge <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> in <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>. `` We're still trying to come up with a way to get involved,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said. `` We just have to prove that discrimination occurred ... that there was an effort to try to keep an unpopular group out by using laws that are too broadly applied.'' The National Gay Rodeo championship was canceled in mid-October just days before its scheduled opening after <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> signed a temporary injunction preventing the event from being held at a private Fallon arena. The 20-acre <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> was leased from owner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantry </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had been turned away by public arenas in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>. In granting the temporary injunction, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> agreed with the county, saying the health and safety of the community was at stake because of expected crowds of up to 1,000 that would strain police and emergency services. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said the rodeo organizers also did not have the proper county license for the event. The judge's decision was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which said the case did not raise questions of homosexual rights or freedom of expression. County officials acted to halt the rodeo after about 50 <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> residents presented them with a petition signed by 1,519 people who did n't want the event in their community. The county is seeking a permanent injunction to block future rodeos on Lantry's property because officials claim it is not large enough or properly equipped. Lantry, with the help of <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, is fighting the permanent injunction. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> set a May 17-19 trial on the issue after denying ACLU-backed motions, including one to move the case from <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said appeals would likely follow and the gay rodeo association was expected to seek damages from the county for more than $ 20,000 in losses because of the cancellation.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Deficit Panel Still Shaky, Despite Bush Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made his appointments for the final two spots on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, but doubts persist over how successful the panel will be in breaking a seven-year deadlock over the budget deficit. The high-level commission was created to help the new president deal with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s biggest economic failure, huge budget deficits that have more than doubled the national debt. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he was choosing former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, R-Nev., and former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Congressman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Lud'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a Democrat and one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s closest friends Under law, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was required to pick one Democrat and one Republican to complete the 14-member commission, which is headed by Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Supporters once believed the bipartisan panel represented the best hope of breaking the impasse between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opposition to tax increases and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to trim domestic spending enough to tame the budget deficit. But even with the appointments, many observers said the commission faces a nearly impossible task of reaching a consensus among panel members who have squabbled openly over such issues as taxes and the need to trim defense spending. `` What <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done is give the commission a renewed look of respectability, but the members are a long way from reaching a consensus on a credible plan that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will accept,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm that bears his name. The commission once had hoped to complete its work before Christmas but <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has said the panel may not issue its recommendations until next September. At that time, the panel could serve as an emergency vehicle which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could use to throw together a compromise with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in order to avoid automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. But <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said Tuesday that he hoped the commission would try to meet a March 1 deadline specified in the law creating the panel. The law did provide an escape clause that would allow the new president to delay the report until Sept. 1. The commission has scheduled 16 days of hearings in January and February to begin making decisions on a deficit-cutting plan even though those sessions have been clouded by a court battle over whether the commission can deliberate in secret. During the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had derided the commission as a stalking horse for tax increases, something he has pledged repeatedly he will not accept. But in making his announcements Tuesday, he tempered his earlier skepticism, noting that he had named <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> ratified the Nov. 8 vote electing him president. `` The swiftness with which I am making these appointments underscores the importance I place on the need to reduce the federal budget deficit,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s appointment had been expected, but the choice of <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> was a surprise and came after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently rejected the advice of some aides that he select <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>, who as a ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s had gained a reputation as a political pragmatist. By picking <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>, some observers said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to go with more of a hardliner against taxes to insure that his `` no-new-tax'' pledge is adhered to. `` From everything I know about him, he would be against taxes and would want to look on the spending side for deficit reductions,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON> is a leading anti-tax supply sider who had been considered as a possible choice for the commission himself. The other 12 members of the commission, evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, were appointed by congressional leaders and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the appointments Tuesday in order to reassure financial markets of his seriousness in cutting the budget deficit. But he said it remains to be seen how seriously the president-elect will take the panel's findings. `` The suspicion is that regardless of what the commission says, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will ignore it,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government freed 281 political prisoners throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Wednesday and restored the civil rights of 1,581 others in a sweeping amnesty to restore political peace. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said prison terms of 92 other political prisoners were reduced and 61 radical students were removed from police wanted lists. The government ordered the amnesty involving 2,015 of what it called `` politically motivated offenders'' as part of efforts to defuse a nationwide furor over demands that former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> be punished for human rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian regime. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> appealed to the nation last month to forgive <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and promised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measures to wipe out vestiges of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general and ally of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, has pledged to introduce full democracy. Dissident groups accused <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> of betraying his promise to free all political prisoners and claimed about 300 remained in jail. Justice officials said 224 `` anti-state criminals'' still were behind bars, but said nearly all were Communist North Korean spies or dissidents convicted of violent crimes. The main political opposition parties welcomed the amnesty. They had frequently demanded such action as a way toward national reconciliation and democracy, but said they would still press for action against <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. Among those released Wednesday were <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Boo-shik </PERSON>. Each was serving a 20-year term for leading a raid on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. One person died and three were hurt when the center was set afire in the protest over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Chun government. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-kun </PERSON>, a leading dissident who won the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> this year, had his civil rights restored. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who was released last June, drew five years in 1986 on charges of overthrowing the government and spreading pro-North Korean propaganda. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said the amnesty was the second since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> last Feb. 25 and involved the largest number of political offenders in a single amnesty.

 A senior diplomat who served as anti-fraud officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was sentenced Tuesday to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty in a scheme to illegally sell visas to Iranian nationals. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>, former first secretary and consul in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, was sentenced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> on conspiracy and fraud charges. <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>, other American citizens and Iranian nationals were accused of conspiring to unlawfully sell visas to Iranians wanting to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many of the Iranians had already been rejected for visas, or were otherwise ineligible to obtain them. As much as $ 5,000 was paid for a single visa, and $ 15,000 bought visas for a family of five, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>'s alleged co-conspirators, visa broker <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Arjad </PERSON> and his associate <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> collecting passports and money from Iranian nationals, said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. Those passports were then taken to <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> at the embassy, who would issue non-immigrant visas to the Iranians without the required documentation and personal interviews, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>, who was the embassy's anti-fraud officer and supervised visa operations, also falsified information on the visa applications and on confidential outgoing cables to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies to justify the illegal visas, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. The indictment listed 12 sales that took place in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> between July and December 1986. Some of the Iranian aliens who tried to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sates </LOCATION> have pleaded guilty in the case. <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> has since resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 The public has glimpsed the nightmarish world of domestic violence through <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony in the <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case. But experts say more than increased awareness is needed to save the lives of children like 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and, now, 5-year-old <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>. `` We were seeing five deaths a day -LRB- nationally -RRB- before <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> died, and five deaths per day since then,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Kempe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> and Neglect in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't blame the public. I do n't think the public knows what to do,'' said <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> made headlines when she died in November 1987 _ a symbol of a system gone wrong. She made front-page news again last week, at the trial of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> _ the man she knew as <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON>, the man accused of murdering her. But last Wednesday _ when the brutal beating death in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> of 5-year-old <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> grabbed the headlines away _ it was the same old story; only the name had changed. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON>, and the mother's boyfriend, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, were unemployed. They lived in a city-owned housing project in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. On the surface, they had nothing in common with the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> family _ except that children in their home also were battered. One day after police found <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> standing over <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s limp body, they returned to the apartment and found <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s 9-year-old half-brother, <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebron </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, quivering in a closet, badly beaten with 10 bones broken. Family Court authorities charged Monday that welfare officials knew that Ms. <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> had a history of child neglect but failed to tell a judge about it, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in Tuesday's editions that during a 1986 custody hearing, welfare officials called the woman a good mother even though the city's <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> had filed a neglect petition against her three years earlier. `` Ninety-five percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public knows child abuse exists _ that's not the issue anymore,'' said <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>. `` My impression is people make some cosmetic changes -LRB- after rekindled awareness of child abuse -RRB-; it's like firing a football coach when you've got bigger problem than just the coach.'' `` Now, we need a new kind of public awareness _ that physical abuse of children, the <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> type cases, are preventable if people want to do something.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> estimated there were 1,132 child-abuse fatalities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year; <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON> puts the figure at 2,000 to 5,000. There were 2.25 million official reports of abused children nationally in 1987, including 25 percent who were physically abused and 14 percent who were sexually abused, the committee's report said. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> fit into both those categories, police said. She also fit into a third category: at least 103 children died of abuse last year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Authorities say those numbers are n't likely to decline despite widespread publicity about child abuse and the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case _ live national television coverage on Cable News Network, a cover story in <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, hours of local TV coverage of Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony. But it will have some positive effect, they believe. `` The <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case puts the spotlight on the topic,'' said Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, coordinator of domestic violence programs for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police. `` This case is very important because it is that much more detailed, and serves to show the dynamics of violence in a family situation.'' Agreed <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Digirolamo </PERSON>, executive director of the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Domestic Violence: `` There clearly is some increase in awareness. The deaths of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> also illustrated one of the more frightening aspects of child abuse: it crosses all lines of race, economics and geography. And domestic violence is rarely limited to just one family member, experts in the field say. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was a lawyer. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, his live-in lover, was a children's book editor. They lived a comfortable existence in a historic building in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s upscale <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. And, authorities said, their two illegally adopted children were ill-treated. When <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was found in a coma Nov. 2, 1987, the other child, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was sitting in a dirty diaper, tethered to a chair and drinking spoiled milk. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> also had been badly battered. In both the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> cases, drugs were apparently involved _ another disturbing trend which has contributed to the rising number of child abuse cases. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> has detailed how she and <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> freebased cocaine while <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lay unconscious in another room. Neighbors of <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said they were also drug users, smoking marijuana and crack. From July 1, 1987, to June 30, 1988, the city <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimated 14 percent of its 55,286 reported abuse cases were tied to drugs _ a 67 percent jump from the previous 12 months.

 In the days before newspapers had the ability to print photographs, special artists were dispatched to great national events _ including presidential inaugurals _ to record the event on sketch pads. That era is recalled, in these days before the inauguration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the nation's 41st president, in a small Capitol exhibit. It displays the views that artists for `` <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Weekly,'' `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s Illustrated News'' and other publications provided of the inauguration of every president from 1853 to 1905. Entitled `` Hail To The Chief,'' the exhibit also recalls the circumstances that gave each of those ceremonies its own flavor. An 1853 sketch shows President-elect <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and outgoing President <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> striding through the Capitol Rotunda on the way to the inaugural platform on the East Front, the traditional site of inaugurals until President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took the oath of office on the West Front in 1981. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s vice president, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, was sworn in by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counsel in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, the only president or vice president-elect ever to take the oath of office outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Convalescing from a serious illness, <PERSON> King </PERSON> died six weeks later. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> objected on religious grounds from swearing his oath. He exercised an option permitted him by the Constitution and affirmed it instead. He is the only president to have done that. The drawing of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>'s inauguration in 1857 shows the scaffolding and hoists being used to build the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wing of the Capitol. By the time <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was inaugurated four years later the new high dome of the Capitol is shown half completed. By the time of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s second inauguration in 1865 the dome is complete, crowned with the statue of Armed Freedom on top. An 1861 illustration shows <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> en route to the Capitol in an open carriage, passing a shop sign reading `` Great Book Sale.'' The exhibit's text recalls that when <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> reached the inaugural stand, he could not find a place to put his `` hallmark stove pipe hat.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s unsuccessful rival for the presidency, reached out his hand for it. `` If I can not be president, at least I can hold his hat,'' he said. In 1869 the nation's preeminent war hero, Gen. <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, was sworn in as president and his predecessor, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, broke a precedent, Insulted by <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s refusal to accompany him on the traditional ride down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> refused to take part in the inaugural ceremonies. The general served two scandal-plagued terms and the 1877 inaugural drawing shows him looking on as <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> takes the oath. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a Republican, had lost the popular vote to Democrat <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> but some <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes were in dispute. The issue was settled by a special commission and the nod went to <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. Since March 4, the date of presidential inaugurations in that era, fell on a Sunday that year, the ceremonies were postponed until Monday, March 5. But to ensure that the nation not be without a president, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> took the oath secretly on March 3 in the Red Room of the White House. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> was inaugurated in 1881 and for the first time women were front and center on the inaugural platform, moving from the seats in the rear traditionally reserved for them. His wife, mother and the wife of President <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> all sat in the front row. When <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> completed the presidential oath, he turned and kissed his mother, the first mother ever to see her son inaugurated as president. Beginning the first of two non-consecutive terms in 1885, <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> took the oath on a family Bible inscribed to <ORGANIZATION> S.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION>. It had been given to him by his mother before he dropped his given name, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>. The illustration for the <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> inauguration in 1889 shows <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> taking the oath surrounded by a sea of umbrellas. Officials had wanted to move the ceremonies in out of the rain but the president-elect overruled them. The year 1889 was also the centennial of the inauguration of the first president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> made the most of the celebration, playing the role of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at several events in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. If he cares to, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can follow suit in 1989, the bicentennial of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inauguration. The artist who depicted <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s inauguration in 1897 shows spectators viewing the scene from the roof of the newly completed <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In 1905, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s Rough Riders gathered to ride in <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>'s inaugural parade. But they ran into a problem: There were n't enough cavalry horses for them to ride. So they used horses borrowed from the horse artillery which were accustomed to hauling cannons, not passengers. The horses did n't follow orders and, the exhibit text notes, `` The Rough Riders literally lived up to their name.'' At the ceremonies, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> wore a ring containing a lock of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s hair loaned to him for the occasion by Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> who had served as <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> secretary. By that time the era of the `` special artist'' was nearly over. The era of the press photographer was about to begin.

The switched ballot gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> one vote fewer than the 112 presidential electors he earned in winning 10 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` I did it for a reason, and the reason was to make a statement about the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, nurse `` It was fine then -LRB- when it began -RRB-, but we've outgrown it.''

The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> vote set the stage for another suspense-free ceremony on Jan. 4, when a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meets and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as vice president, is to open the sealed ballots and formally declare himself the president-elect. Although other electors voted as expected, many agreed with <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> about the antiquated but constitutionally required <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> system devised by the Founding Fathers two centuries ago. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> elector <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schouweiller </PERSON> called it `` silly'' and `` archaic.'' `` However,'' she added, `` I suspect it will be with us for a long time to come.'' After casting their votes for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s 11 electors voted 9-2 to pass along some unsolicited advice to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the form of a resolution urging the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> be scrapped. `` The system is fatally flawed,'' said elector <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Longley </PERSON>. `` We should not be in a position to decide upon who should be president. It should be decided most appropriately by the American people.'' Although the Constitution does not require electors to vote as their state's voters directed, there have been few deviations over two centuries of elections. Before <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>'s change, there had been only eight `` faithless electors.'' Democratic electors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and a Republican in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, did n't carry through with suggestions that they might cast symbolic votes for another candidate for president or vice president. `` I have reservations about Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> elector <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` But our president -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB-, who I do not have reservations about, has seen fit to choose him, so I'm going to go with what he says. ... I should have abstained, probably.'' Some states carried out brief ceremonies steeped in history, while others made a party of the event. Still others got the formalities of voting and paper-signing over within 10 minutes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, telephoned electors pledged to him in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and addressed a ceremonial gathering of his electors in the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I'm sorry I'm not here in another capacity,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But I want you to know there's nothing that compares to running for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I wish the president-elect well,'' he added. `` But I also know there were some things we were fighting about in the campaign that are going to be there on January 20th, and they're important.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be sworn into office Jan. 20. Many electors said they had received mail from people urging them to deny <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> his election as vice president. Some said they were n't enthusiastic about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, but they were n't buying the idea of dumping him. `` I love <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I'm very enthusiastic about that, but I'm not real happy with the selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' said elector <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> chairman who voted for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> anyway. `` I think the process should be changed and I hope it will be changed,'' he said. Among the other electors who voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; his designated White House chief of staff, Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign supporter.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is laying the groundwork to send the next generation of astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit early in the 21st century, with missions to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and a space station on a Martian moon among the possibilities. In a report released Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the nation must make a `` modest investment of resources'' during the 1990s to prepare the nation for a range of opportunities in space. `` This ability is critical to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> leadership in space,'' said the report titled, `` Beyond Earth's Boundaries: Human Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.'' The report examined several strategies for exploring the inner reaches of the solar system, including establishing a manned lunar observatory, setting up a space station on the <LOCATION> Martian </LOCATION> moon Phobos or sending astronauts to the red planet itself early in the next century. The ambitious blueprint addresses President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s directive on space policy issued last January. The directive sets as a long-range goal `` to expand human presence and activity beyond <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit into the solar system.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, assistant administrator of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Exploration, said `` there's every indication'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will support that policy. The underpinnings of any strategy to send space explorers to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and beyond in the next two decades will be increased <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> funding for development of new technology, life sciences research, unmanned robotic missions, development of a new fleet of launch vehicles able to lift heavier loads, and continued commitment to Space Station Freedom, which is planned for Earth orbit in the mid-1990s. If those conditions are met, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could send astronauts to <LOCATION> Phobos </LOCATION> in 2003 or to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> in 2007 or establish by 2005 a lunar base from which astronauts could build a Mars outpost in 2015, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, who headed the Office of Exploration during production of the report. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates for the missions studied in the report. `` We are not talking about missions that are cheap,'' he said, but `` we think these are affordable.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said such missions probably could be accomplished at less real cost than the Apollo program, which put <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> astronauts on the moon in 1969. At its height, the Apollo program cost about 4 percent of the federal budget annually, which in today's dollars would be about $ 25 billion, he said. `` You ca n't do the civil space program on the cheap,'' he said, noting the nation now spends about $ 11 billion annually on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> programs. The fiscal 1989 federal budget is about $ 1.1 trillion. `` We're not a poor nation. We can figure out how to do these things if they're important to us,'' he said, adding that international cooperation could help support these missions. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> must leap many technological hurdles before it can accomplish the goal of establishing a permanent human presence in space, but `` I do n't see any show stoppers there.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Project Pathfinder, under whose umbrella much of the research will be done, gets $ 40 million this year and the same amount next year, despite <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s request for $ 100 million. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said annual funding for the program must increase to $ 100 million soon. The report focused on four case studies for sending astronauts to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, Phobos and <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. One scenario would send astronauts to Phobos and then on to Mars; another would launch astronauts directly to Mars; a third would establish a manned observatory on the far side of the moon; and a fourth would use an outpost on the moon as a stepping stone to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, who is now special assistant to the director at <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, emphasized that the four case studies are not proposed missions, but rather vehicles for assessing exploration techniques and validating assumptions. A key finding, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> said, is that a mission to Phobos could significantly offset the scale and uncertainties of a direct mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. An Earth-to-Mars mission would require many new technologies, including advanced propulsion and braking systems, and would require advanced operations such as in-orbit assembly, long-term storage and in-orbit transfer of propellant. Much work in the life sciences also would be needed, and because the mission would last more than 14 months artificial gravity might be needed to maintain the health of the crew, the report said. Phobos is believed to be an asteroid `` captured'' by Mars' gravity and is thought to contain a substantial amount of water and carbon-based materials, which could offer potential sources of rocket fuel that could be tapped for exploratory missions to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> `` Phobos is an attractive way to go to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` I would be surprised if Phobos is n't a part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> going to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>.''

 Bank robbers killed one policeman and seriously wounded another in the central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city of Coventry Monday before holing up in a suburban house where one robber shot himself to death, police said. One of the alleged robbers gave himself up but the other ignored police attempts to negotiate and then shot himself in the head in a back room of the house, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> Assistant Chief Constable <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Police Superintendent <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said the officer who died was an unarmed patrolman in his mid-30s. He was thought to have died instantly after being shot at point-blank range with a double-barreled shotgun. Police said he had stopped the raiders' getaway car soon after the robbery at the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in which $ 1,100 was stolen. The robbers then switched cars and drove onto a highway where they were rammed by an unmarked police car. Police said a patrolman in that vehicle was shot in the stomach. The gunmen then ran across a golf course before forcing their way into the home of a plumbing contractor and his family. It was not known whether they took any hostages. Police said the wounded officer, also in his 30s, was recovering in hospital. A third officer was being treated in hospital for shock.

 At night, the brightest light shining in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> city of 10 million is cast by the moon. Spotlights on public monuments, the flashing neon glare of billboards, lights in office towers, store windows and even on a Christmas tree near a main thoroughfare have been turned down or even off by government order. There is an electricity shortage. Streetlights have been dimmed by 50 percent. Drivers, who usually careen along narrow, often cobblestone streets downtown with only their cars' parking lights have taken to turning on low beams. The problem stems from seasonally low levels of water in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Limay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Neuquen </LOCATION> rivers that feed hydroelectric stations and the shutdown for repairs or maintenance of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s two nuclear power plants. The system `` is working at the limit of its capacity, and we should be prepared for whatever eventuality and are running the risk of a total outage,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Larriqueta </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Portenos, as residents of this port city are called, have had to make do with rotating, scheduled outages of five hours a day since last week. City residents have become accustomed to summertime electricity shortages as the city has grown faster than its public services can handle. Blackouts, which have occurred half a dozen times since 1965, are relatively rare, however. The last occurred in November 1985. The latest scheduled outages have meant walking up flights of stairs for lack of working elevators, sweating in late spring heat for lack of air conditioning, and dodging four, five and sometimes six lanes of cars at rush hour for lack of functioning traffic signals. Beginning today, the hours of the three government-controlled television stations in this capital city will be cut back to 12 hours _ noon to midnight. The two private stations have been requested by the government to do likewise. The usual hours of operation are 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. Nighttime events like horseracing at the <LOCATION> Hipodromo </LOCATION> and concerts have been canceled until further notice unless the facility has its own source of electricity. Soccer games, usually played at night to avoid daytime heat, have been rescheduled for the afternoon. At the huge Salto Grande hydroelectric complex on the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> north of the capital, only one of 14 turbines was operating Tuesday. The rest were idled by lack of water. The Atucha nuclear power plant, about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, has been shut down since August for repairs to its cooling system. The Embalse station, 465 miles to the west of the capital, is undergoing routine maintenance. About three weeks ago, the government for the first time in years ordered clocks to be set back one hour to take advantage of the extra daylight. The time change will stay in effect at least until Jan. 15, when one of the nuclear plants should be back on line, said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, director of planning at the the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>' energy secretariat Water levels probably wo n't rise until seasonal rains return in May, he said. On the lighter side, energy restrictions will be lifted the following two weekends for Christmas and New Year's, a government spokesman said.

 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> gave departing general director <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> a farewell party Monday night, and the grand ballroom of the Plaza Hotel resounded with celebrity toasts. `` She is so warm, effervescent and fun, you immediately forget her incredible voice. When you do, she gets really annoyed,'' teased actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> concluded, `` You have garnered as much love as you have praise for your work as an artist and business woman, and I toast you.'' <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> noted that she has had a `` meaningful relationship'' with the opera company for 33 years and two months. She was its coloratura superstar and for the past 10 years its general director. Following her resignation the opera announced she would be succeeded in March by <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>. `` I have reached the age of 59, and 50 years of my life have been spent in opera,'' she said. `` Interesting things are being offered to me. I feel a third career is somewhere out there right around the corner.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> program `` 60 Minutes'' suggested in his toast that <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> become mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, or as he put it, `` her honor, the prima donna.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who spoke at a reception before the dinner, suggested that <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> become a TV interviewer.

<TEXT>
 A consent decree may be reached by the end of the week for the cleanup of a federally owned uranium enrichment plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says. An agreement to clean up the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> Gaseous Diffusion Plant near <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was announced last month by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and state Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. However, the plan still was under review by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> said. A senior department official, who asked that he not be identified, said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` may have a decision by the end of the week on a consent decree'' that would involve court supervision of a cleanup. When <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> announced the $ 50 million cleanup plan last month, they said it was significant because the federal agency would be bound by state law and regulation. The <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial nuclear power reactors. It generates toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, solvents and metals, as well as radioactive materials. When the agreement was announced Nov. 22, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said he hoped it would serve as a model for other tough cleanup cases, such as the government-owned Fernald plant near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Environmental officials say that plant has dumped radioactive waste improperly, possibly contaminating ground water, since it began processing uranium for nuclear weapons in 1951. The <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> plan calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to be subject to orders issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which would supervise the cleanup of about 6 million pounds of waste. Last month, officials said the agreement still needed to be incorporated into a federal court consent decree.

<HEAD>Regulators Propose Reinsurance Agency To Oversee Thrift Clean Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators are proposing the creation of a new agency, possibly drawing money from banks, credit unions and savings institutions, to oversee the clean up of the money-losing savings and loan industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, on Monday sent the broad outlines of the proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is formulating the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plans for dealing with hundreds of insolvent savings institutions, agency spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, in a speech to a group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, proposed what he called a `` reinsurance agency'' for all federally insured financial institutions. On an unrelated topic, Wall also said the bank board is offering to make foreclosed properties from failed savings institutions available to house the homeless in a half dozen cities. The bank board's insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been paying for a record number of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescues this year primarily through promissory notes pledging future income from an assessment on still-operating institutions. Wall has argued previously that the fees paid by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurance funds, were meant to cover a `` normal'' level of failures, not the `` catastrophic'' level of the current thrift crisis. Through Monday, regulators said they have resolved the cases of 159 insolvent thrifts this year. More than 400 insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls remain open and hundreds of others are close to insolvency. The reinsurance agency would oversee three insurance funds _ for banks, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and credit unions. It could collect premiums from all three, spending them when one of the funds got in trouble. It also could serve as the mechanism for further borrowing to pay for the thrift crisis or as the conduit for any money <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to spend on the cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, in an interview, said the proposal leaves open who will pay for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L cleanup and whether a new agency's expenditures would be counted toward the budget deficit. `` I do n't think it is intended to be a back door way of getting them -LRB- banks and credit unions -RRB- to pay for the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s current problems,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` The concept is both a funding mechanism and a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs'' in the future. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in weekend editions that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in its 1990 budget, will acknowledge for the first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the thrift industry problem. An administration source, who declined to be named, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates the cost of restoring the thrift industry to health at $ 60 billion to $ 75 billion if interest rates remain unchanged and as high as $ 105 billion if interest rates increase by two percentage points. The figures were first reported by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Regarding the proposal to use S & amp; L properties for the homeless, <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the bank board is talking with six or seven cities in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and in the North and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. He declined to identify them. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the bank board would lend the properties _ in some cases commercial buildings near soup kitchens _ to municipal governments, which in turn would pay to administer them as temporary shelters. `` That ball is in their court at this juncture. They have to decide if they have the funds,'' he said. `` We would like to get it done in the winter when this housing would be most useful to the homeless.'' Discussions with the cities started several months ago, <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said. Another effort, to persuade private groups to purchase foreclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poor families, began about a year ago, he said. Wall disclosed the homeless initiative on the same day that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in announcing the appointment of Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said his administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem of homelessness.

<HEAD>FAA Proposes Change in Airport `High Density' Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Large airlines at four major airports would have to prove they make heavy use of their takeoff and landing slots or risk losing them to other carriers, under a proposed federal rule change. The proposal, released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, would revise the `` high density'' rule at <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Hare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> National. The rule, adopted in 1969, limits the number of takeoff and landing slots at the airports during heavy traffic periods. Currently, airlines must show that they are using those slots during 65 percent of the heavy traffic hours over a two-month period. The new proposal would require large air carriers with 10 or more slots to show that the slots are being used at a 90 percent rate or the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would consider withdrawing them. The requirement would be 80 percent for carriers with five to nine slots and would stay at 65 percent for all others. The slots that are taken away from an airline could then be available for sale or reallocation to a different airline, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The change would `` increase opportunity for new entrant carriers to have access to high-density airports, and for small incumbent carriers to increase the number of operations at those airports,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said his company was `` encouraged'' that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> wanted to make sure the takeoff and landing slots are fully utilized. `` We're using every single slot we have,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` At some airports we obviously could use more.'' He said that in some cases, airlines have held their slots without fully using them. The limits on takeoff and landing slots are necessary because an airport's air traffic control system has limited capacity, <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` We are not in favor of any slot program at all if it can be avoided,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said, but eliminating the system would require costly expansion of the air traffic control systems. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is seeking public and aircraft industry comments on its proposal.

<HEAD>Government Fining Companies That Missed Emissions Reporting
Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is levying almost $ 1.5 million in fines against 25 companies for failing to meet a new deadline for reporting chemical emissions. Almost half the penalties would be accounted for by one plant, <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s works at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, which was accused by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of not reporting emissions of 33 different substances ranging from aluminum to xylene. Inland's proposed fine was set at $ 721,000. Spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefley </PERSON> said Monday, `` We reported, except we reported late,'' after the July 1 deadline. `` Since this is the country's second-largest steel plant, it was a monumental task.'' <PERSON> Lefley </PERSON> declined further comment. The law requiring reports of emissions was passed in 1986 in response to the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> disaster in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> two years earlier in which more than 2,000 people were killed by escaping methyl isocyanate, a gas used in making pesticides. Companies in a broad swath of industrial categories are required, among other things, to report releases to air, water and land of 320 hazardous or toxic chemicals or chemical families. EPA forms were supposed to have been filled out and filed with both <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and state authorities. All 25 plants proposed for fines were checked by inspectors from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional offices, and penalties were chosen to reflect the size of the company, the number of chemicals that should have been reported, the quantities released and the amount being used, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're not talking about a major enforcement action here,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy organization that has kept track of developments in the field. `` There are 15,000 to 16,000 companies that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> knows of that have not filled out the forms out of 30,000'' that were obliged to. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenuta </PERSON> said she could not confirm <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s figures However, she said investigators were finding that of companies they looked at, roughly one-third had not complied fully with the reporting requirements. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> could have imposed fines of $ 25,000 per day. The companies have 20 days to notify <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> whether they want to pay the fine, to try to negotiate a lower fine or to contest the fine before an administrative law judge. Here are the companies and locations of the affected plants, along with the plant's principal product or line of business, the chemicals whose emissions should have been reported and the fines. The agency did not say how much of each chemical was involved.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> is homeless, wealthy and unwilling to change even though his health may someday force him to use the $ 190,000 estate he inherited from his parents in 1979. The 71-year-old recently agreed to claim the inheritance, which has grown to $ 207,421, but said he has no intention of changing his lifestyle. For the last 20 years, <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> has lived in alleys or boarding rooms. He likes his lifestyle and has no use for money, the former cab driver said during a street corner interview last week. `` I do n't want it. When you're young, the money means something,'' he said, refusing a lengthy interview or photographs. If he did have money, he said, he would just lose it to thieves. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said he has known about the money since his father died in 1979. He claimed it only because of pressure from relatives, he said. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s father, a blacksmith named <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, left the estate to his son, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Controller </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. When the inheritance went unclaimed, the account was turned over to the county <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrator </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, then to the state, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zingale </PERSON>, a special assistant to the state controller in the Division of Unclaimed Property. <PERSON> Zingale </PERSON> said <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, contacted him in September 1987 asking for help in her efforts to get <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> to claim the money. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was uninterested, but more than a year later, he did sign documents, <PERSON> Zingale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> said the money will probably be deposited in to an account in <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s name. Last week, doctors at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> he had a heart condition and other medical problems, said Mayor <PERSON> Lachman </PERSON>, another of <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s cousins. `` Living on the streets, he could be harassed and pressured for money and he was scared,'' <PERSON> Lachman </PERSON> said. `` He was never really interested in the money because he wants to live a different kind of lifestyle. `` Living on the street _ that's his greatest desire. I want him to live a little better, a little easier,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquin </PERSON> says she's been amazed by an outpouring of support since her husband was nearly electrocuted trying to help an accident victim. A neighbor plows her driveway and a merchant dropped off a Christmas tree. `` Somebody else brought us our wood, and people have been stacking our wood,'' she said. `` Every couple of days I'll come home from the hospital and dinner will be on the doorstep.'' On Nov. 25, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquin </PERSON> ran into downed electrical wires while rushing to aid the driver of a truck that struck a utility pole in <LOCATION> Shaftsbury </LOCATION>, in southwest <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. As his family watched from their vehicle, 7,200 volts of electricity pulsed through <PERSON> Paquin </PERSON>'s body. His sister, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, revived him and rescue crews delivered him to the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> partially paralyzed, with serious internal injuries and burns on his neck and knees. Today, <PERSON> Paquin </PERSON>, 35, is in fair condition and recovering slowly at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. He receives burn treatment and therapy, and his 7-year-old daughter <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> reads to him. The other day he reached a milestone _ he moved his legs. `` I'm glad to be alive, but it's really hard not to know how much and how long it's going to take to recover,'' he said last week. `` I'm really lucky that people in my town and other people around, they just have been really good and supportive and everything,'' he said, tears in his eyes, when asked what keeps him going. `` It gives you some faith when you feel people have faith in you. And that's the way people have been making me feel.'' <PERSON> Paquin </PERSON> is a self-employed carpenter and member of the Rescue Squad in his hometown of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, a small town 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. One of his friends, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, described him as full of fun and life. `` He's a musician. He's always the life of the party _ he'd bring his banjo or guitar. The unfortunate part of the accident, he ca n't move his hands at all But that may just be a matter of therapy,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. Friends said it was just like him to rush to the aid of an accident victim. `` That's why he was on the rescue squad in the first place,'' his wife said. `` We saw the accident, and ... I was just thinking, ` We're supposed to be someplace,' and I remember him saying something about he did n't see any rescue vehicles and he thought he could do something. It's not something I could do.'' Ironically, the driver of the truck apparently picked his way through the live wires and left the scene moments before the Paquins drove by, according to police and witnesses. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> pleaded innocent Monday to charges of leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended license. A court clerk said he was released on his own recognizance pending an appearance sometime next month. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquin </PERSON>, a part-time, free-lance journalist, said the most difficult days were the ones right after the accident. `` It's so hard to explain to anyone who has n't gone through it, the constant fear you'll get a call from the hospital and something will be wrong,'' she said. In the last week or so, after staying with relatives while her husband was in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, she returned home and was greeted by the generosity of neighbors and friends. One changed the tires on her car. The <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION> has begun a fund-raising campaign to help defray the couple's expenses. `` He has survived something no one thought he should have survived. Everybody thinks it's a miracle,'' she said.

For the three weeks before Christmas, however, the prison suspends its rules against mailed food and allows inmates to receive packages up to 25 pounds holding mail-order and homemade delicacies. To inspect the food packages, the prison must hold up inspections of other packages, which wait until after Christmas to reach inmates. `` The food is more important and meaningful to them anyway,'' <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said. `` They can get clothes all year.'' The largest purveyors to the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> prisoners are <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, an Illinois-based catalog firm specializing in low-cost items, followed by Service Merchandise of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and merchandising giants <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said. Clothing is the big sales item at the medium-security prison, followed by towels, television sets, radios and fans, he said. `` We've put together a little booklet on what they can order, but essentially it's any basic necessity,'' <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said. `` They know by word of mouth that if there were any problems with anyone trying to bring in weapons or drugs, we would cut back on the orders and we can trace it right back to who is responsible.'' Payments are made by the prison against inmate accounts, he said. They build up accounts by working in prison, or by getting money from their families. Regulations on what prisoners can order vary widely from state to state and prison to prison, according to state and federal officials, with federal prisoners allowed only limited catalog-ordering privileges. `` They have to have special prior permission, but half the time the issue is not so much the regulations but the fact that our inmates just do n't have the money,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the federal bureau of prisons. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> treats its prison customers `` just like any others,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON>, except that it delivers packages directly to the prisons rather than to its retail stores. `` Obviously they ca n't get out to pick up their packages,'' she said. But <PERSON> Paysaver </PERSON> has employees assigned just to its prison business, and Christmas is a particularly busy time. The woman in charge of the company's prison sales, who asked that her name not be used, said some of her dealings with inmates `` have helped restore my faith in human nature. `` Sometimes they do n't figure the shipping charges right and if it's just a couple of dollars, I send it out and just tuck a note inside as to what is owed and almost always I get a check back,'' she said. `` I got a letter from a man at <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- who said he was sending Christmas presents to his kids in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and asked if I could put a note inside the package saying, ` With love, from Daddy.'''

<HEAD>Jury Decides Against Shell In $2 Billion Arsenal Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BRUNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Insurance companies claimed a major victory after a jury decided <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would have to spend up to $ 2 billion to clean up three decades of pesticide pollution at the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` The verdict was a clean, straight win for the insurers,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunshoft </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, the British insurance market that had faced the biggest share of possible liability. `` To say that this is an exciting win and a gratifying win is an understatement.'' The 250 insurance companies involved convinced a jury they should not be held responsible for the contamination because <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> knew of the pollution for 30 years. They claimed <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> was not covered by its 800 different policies any more than a homeowner who set fire to his own home. `` Naturally, we're extremely disappointed with the outcome of this lengthy trial,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McHam </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We believe there are sound legal grounds for appealing to a higher court and we will appeal.'' In 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered the oil company to pay the cleanup bill, then estimated at $ 1.8 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> subsequently began trying to collect the money from its insurers. Dozens of insurance company attorneys whooped for joy Monday when the verdict was read in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The lengthy trial was held in a makeshift courtroom at <ORGANIZATION> Crestmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to make room for all the lawyers. Eleven jurors voted for the insurance companies for the period from 1952-59, with one juror against. For the period 1960-82, the vote was 11 for the insurers and one undecided. A jury in a civil suit does not have to reach a unanimous verdict. The jurors declined to comment on their decision. During those years, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> leased the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> land at the arsenal north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for a pesticide production plant. The soil and groundwater at the plant was polluted by <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> operations, and the pollution seeped into nearby drinking water wells. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> attorneys also argued before Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanam </PERSON> that the liability should be mainly with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> because it provided the leaking pipes and ponds used by the oil company. `` Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, the citizens of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> can be confident that <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> has and will continue to meet its share of responsibilities at the Rocky Mountain arsenal. We are hopeful that the remaining issues between the state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> can be resolved, thereby allowing the arsenal cleanup to proceed expeditiously,'' Ms. <PERSON> McHam </PERSON> said. The trial, which began in October 1987, was held in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> because of the county's record of completing cases promptly. It included more than 4,000 exhibits and hundreds of hours of testimony. Ms. <PERSON> McHam </PERSON> said she could not estimate the cost of the cleanup. Insurance industry sources put it at $ 2 billion.

<HEAD>Styrofoam Snowmen, Curried Turkey: Christmas Is Different At The
Equator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> SINGAPORE </LOCATION> _ The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> shortage has been averted and it looks like Christmas as usual at the equator this year. In this steamy tropical land, Christmas is Styrofoam snowmen and chestnuts roasted by street vendors in shorts. Department store Santas are flown in from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, and the turkey is often curried. Most Singaporeans have never seen snow, let alone a reindeer. But `` I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'' and `` Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer'' have been broadcast staples for weeks. Any danger that a shortage of Santas might dampen the holiday spirit ended when more than 100 American tourists dressed as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> started arriving in early December. Part of a `` Santa goodwill tour'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a charitable organization, they play <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> for charity while traveling each Christmas. Toys ` R' Us and a few other stores wo n't have Santas because, in the words of one merchant, `` it is hard to find a suitable candidate.'' But one department store, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s, flew in a man from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> who store spokeswoman <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Phua </PERSON> claims is `` the real <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>.'' While his birth certificate identifies him as <PERSON> Saastamoinen </PERSON> <PERSON> Seppo </PERSON>, the resident of <LOCATION> Rovaniemi </LOCATION> in Finnish <LOCATION> Lapland </LOCATION> is the real thing, she insisted. Illuminated trumpets, silver bells, angels, candles, fir trees, snowflakes, reindeer, lanterns, yule logs, fairy lights and other glitter adorn shopping centers and hotels. Street vendors in T-shirts and shorts sell roasted chestnuts. The Centerpoint shopping center spent $ 207,254 on its fairytale Christmas theme, decorating its building as a medieval castle. All this in a country 85 miles north of the <LOCATION> equator </LOCATION> where the average daily temperature is 80 degrees. Only about 200,000 of the 2.6 million people in this island republic profess to being Christians, according to the last census in 1980. But apart from the country's independence day holiday in August, no other period comes close to be being celebrated by the entire population. The observance of Christmas, a British colonial import, appears to have intensified in recent years among a population that is 76 percent Chinese, 15 percent Malay and 6 percent Indian. It blends Western trimmings with an Oriental flavor. Roast turkey with stuffing is available, but so are a variety of other dishes based on the traditional bird, including curried turkey and turkey noodles. The `` singing Christmas Tree,'' a multi-tiered stage in the shape of a tree for a choir from the <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, has been a yuletide feature in recent years. In 1986, 27 men and women caroled their way into the Guinness Book of World Records by singing for more than 74 hours, ending at 1:05 a.m. Christmas morning. Reporter <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> lamented in The Sunday Times that local carols in the Malay language, such as <PERSON> Ang </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasko </PERSON> ay Sumapit -LRB- Christmas is Here Again -RRB- or <PERSON> Pasko </PERSON> sa aming Nayon -LRB- Christmas in My <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> -RRB-, were neglected in favor of old favorites from the West. `` Deejays also play foreign carols on the air more than they do the native ones ... Fake snow, fireplaces and Styrofoam snowmen are often found in Christmas decorations in homes, department stores and offices,'' she wrote.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s leading educator says the country's youth should no longer be taught by rote, that teachers now recognize that individual thinking should be cultivated, not plowed under. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, says students will be allowed to choose elective courses and teachers will be able to teach once-banned classics of 20th century Russian literature under reforms being considered at a national education conference this week. He did not specify which novels might be permitted to sway young minds, but some of the masterworks rehabilitated in recent years include <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>'s `` Doctor Zhivago'' and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulgakov </PERSON>'s `` Master and <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON>. Forcing every student to fit the same mold, which was long the Soviet educational norm, fails to encourage greatness, <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON> acknowledged. `` The teacher hits the nail on the head'' to keep it from sticking out, but this does great damage to the individual, he told a news conference Monday. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly has said changes in teaching methods and in the nation's curriculum are necessary to guarantee that his drive for social and economic reform is a success. `` We pin hopes for the future largely on the work of our school _ which is only natural _ with its own teaching talents and the creative pursuits of the Soviet teacher,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in February at a special meeting devoted to school reform. <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON> raised the startling possibility that the new core curriculum might not include mathematics _ considered abroad to be a forte of Soviet education _ but that seemed to be his personal desire rather than a pending policy. `` How many here can compute the square root of 174?'' he asked an auditorium full of Soviet and foreign reporters, none of whom answered. `` Does happiness depend on this?'' he asked. He suggested the core curriculum should include language study and literature, science, and history. This week's conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will choose the core curriculum and the electives to be offered at higher two levels, <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON> said. The first stage of schooling will last three or four years, depending on the aptitude of the students, and they will have to pass a test to move up because `` if a student poorly reads and counts when he moves on, it builds in problems for the future,'' he said. In the higher grades, students will spend less time on literary criticism and more time reading actual literature, <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON> said. `` We have students who can tell you <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>'s mistakes, but they have never read ` War and Peace,''' he said. More literature from foreign countries and the non-Russian nationalities of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be added to the curriculum, he said. More Soviet students will be going abroad in exchange programs as well, he said. Already, the 2,500 young people attending classes outside their homeland is three times the number in 1985, he said.

 In 1899, two local businessmen went to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and acquired the first rights to bottle and distribute <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> _ for $ 1. That's how the world's first <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> bottling plant wound up in this southeastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> city, and that's why a retired <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> executive wants to open a museum devoted to the popular soft drink. <PERSON> Sebert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> heads a group that's working on plans for The <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, a proposed $ 3 million to $ 5 million high-tech museum near the city's riverfront. `` We want to show the stages that <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottling went through from the beginning of the bottles all the way to the cans and the talking machines, all the ways it has reflected changes in the American life,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> consultant helping plan the project.

 Students stayed home today from schools near a volcano after it erupted for the first time in 26 years, belching columns of fire and a plume of smoke that rose to 6,000 feet, authorities said.

The eruption countermeasures office in <LOCATION> Kamifurano </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from the volcano, said 88 students stayed home today from five elementary, junior high and high schools within 15 miles of the mountain. Officials said the students live in areas from which quick evacuation might be difficult, so they are being kept together with their families. When <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION> erupted in 1926, the heat melted almost all the snow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people in two nearby villages.

<HEAD>Cost Of Quake Deals Blow To Gorbachev's Reform Efforts, Officials
Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet officials say the immense cost of raising new cities from the rubble of the Armenian earthquake will slow <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to achieve social and economic reforms. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Batalin </PERSON> told reporters in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Monday that housing construction will begin next month in the cities and villages destroyed in the Dec. 7 quake, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The new buildings will be significantly more resistant to seismic activity than those that collapsed in the quake, the official news agency quoted him as saying. The quake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, leveled the cities of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, as well as up to 100 villages, and left more than 500,000 people homeless. Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who heads a Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as saying reconstruction will cost much more than the $ 8.3 billion originally estimated. He called the destruction `` enormous'' and said the disaster and relief effort dealt a palpable blow to the national economy and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for change, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The cost of rebuilding `` will affect the implementation of the social programs being carried out in the course of economic reform in the U.S.S.R.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON> will be rebuilt on the same sites, while <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> will be shifted to a spot where there is less danger of another earthquake, according to <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>. New buildings will not exceed three to four stories. Almost every building of more than five stories collapsed in the quake, and officials all the way up to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have criticized shoddy construction they say contributed to a death toll in the tens of thousands. The Communist Party daily Pravda estimated Monday that 40,000-45 ,000 people were killed in the quake, at least 10,000 fewer than an earlier toll of 55,000 given by Soviet officials <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> announced that a government commission was formed to investigate technical violations in the construction of high-rise apartments and other buildings in `` an area of seismic danger.'' Since the quake, thousands of people have been living in tents or in the open air, and the onset of winter in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has dealt survivors and rescue workers alike one more hardship. Snow and freezing temperatures again were forecast for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today. The <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> mountain range near the quake zone already is capped with snow. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radio said evacuation of children, women and the elderly from the earthquake zone was nearing completion. Within days, Pravda said, only men involved in rebuilding the area should remain. <PERSON> Batalin </PERSON> told the Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts that 70,094 people have been evacuated from the quake zone and that 33,053 have been relocated to holiday resorts. The bodies of thousands of people still buried in the rubble pose the threat of epidemic, and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said survivors in the area were given medicine `` to make them more resistant to infectious diseases.'' No survivors have been found since Saturday, but there has been no official announcement of an end to the search. Because of the staggering damage done by the quake, `` all houses, factories and farms have to be built anew,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. V.I. <PERSON> Chernovanov </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the Soviet agriculture committee, said preliminary estimates show it will cost $ 5 billion just to rebuild wrecked farm buildings, barns and other rural facilities. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON>, the government's top education official, told reporters that `` practically all the schools were destroyed,'' including a <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> polytechnical institute that collapsed, killing 1,000 students and teachers. Children must be sent to other areas because the quake wiped out 380 educational institutions, from preschools to technical institutes, he said. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, on Monday offered the Soviets the assistance of her religious order, the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, which operates orphanages, hospitals and schools in more than 25 countries. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say whether the Soviets agreed to accept <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>'s offer. In the past, religious groups have been barred from engaging in public assistance or operating hospitals, schools and other social services.

The 16-year-old boys were reported missing to the <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after they did n't return home from a Sunday afternoon outing at Salt Peter Cave near <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION>, 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. The names of the boys were not released. The parents went to the mouth of the cave Sunday evening and located a pair of socks and shoes belonging to one of the boys. `` One of the boys' father and a friend apparently went in the cave hoping to find them,'' a sheriff's spokesman said. `` When they started having trouble with their lights, the father sent the friend out to get help. But the father stayed in there.'' It took the <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> and Rescue Team about two hours to find all three. They were all out of the cave by about 3 a.m. Monday. `` They were tired, cold, wet and dirty, but they were all OK,'' the sheriff's spokesman said. The rescuers traveled about four miles before finding the boys. `` It does n't sound like much, except when you consider we were belly-crawling through 58-degree water most of the way, four miles is a long way,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON>, who led the rescue squad. `` Many places were so tight our backs and bellies were scraping at the same time.'' The boys apparently started having trouble with their flashlights during the expedition, he said. They knew they did n't have enough light to lead them out of the cave, so they found a dry place and waited for help.

<HEAD>Singapore To Change Security Law to Outlaw Court Reviews</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says it will amend the Internal Security Act next month to bar courts from challenging its right to jail people without charge or trial for up to two years. The planned amendment is the result of a Dec. 8 appellate court ruling that released on a technicality four people detained under the security law. On Monday, the government rejected the court move, and the four were rearrested. `` If <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> courts review ministerial discretion in security matters, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> judges will in effect become responsible and answerable for decisions affecting the security of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. This was not and is not the intention of the legislature as expressed in the ISA,'' the government statement said. Courts have been guided by a 1969 precedent that said detention cases were outside their purview. The amendment will legally entrench this precedent. Under the Internal Security Act, the government may imprison for up to two years any citizen who, in the opinion of the home affairs minister, poses a danger to national security or public order. Detention orders can be renewed indefinitely. The Dec. 8 decision involved the arrests of lawyer <PERSON> Teo </PERSON> <PERSON> Soh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lung </PERSON>, 39; social worker <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, 27; dramatist <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> <PERSON> Souk </PERSON> <PERSON> Yee </PERSON>, 29; and teacher <PERSON> Chng </PERSON> <PERSON> Suan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tze </PERSON>, 39. Chng had seven months to serve on his original detention order and the others six months each. They were among 21 people first detained in mid-1987 on charges of trying to undermine the government as part of a `` clandestine communist network.'' The judges reviewing their case said in a 107-page verdict that the judiciary could review the cases of detainees held under the security act. In rejecting the verdict, the government said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> next month will revise the Internal Security Act with retroactive effect to say court have no right of review. The governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls 80 of the 81 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Holiday moviegoers are favoring comedy over drama, as the lighthearted `` Twins'' topped the new drama `` Rain Man,'' according to weekend box-office figures. For the second week in a row, `` Twins'' was the nation's most popular movie, and two comedies, `` The Naked Gun'' and `` Scrooged,'' finished ahead of the serious `` Tequila Sunrise.'' According to figures issued Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, No. 1 `` Twins,'' focusing on non-identical brothers -LRB- <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> -RRB- separated at birth, grossed $ 7.8 million. In second place was `` Rain Man,'' the new drama about an autistic savant -LRB- <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> -RRB- on the road with his conniving brother -LRB- <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> -RRB-. `` Rain Man'' collected $ 7 million. Two other comedies continued strongly, as `` The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'' and `` Scrooged'' finished in third and fourth place, respectively. `` The Naked Gun'' a spoof of police movies starring <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, sold $ 5.6 million worth of tickets, while `` Scrooged,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s comic interpretation of the Dickens classic, gathered $ 4.6 million. In fifth place was the new comedy `` Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> as dueling con men, opened weakly with receipts of $ 3.8 million. It was followed by `` Tequila Sunrise,'' a drama featuring <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> as a reformed drug dealer, which drew $ 3 million. The holiday season's two animated films _ `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Co.'' and `` The Land Before Time'' _ finished in seventh and eighth place. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and Co.,'' an <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> Twist-inspired story about a homeless kitten, grossed $ 2.3 million. `` The Land Before Time,'' a tale of baby dinosaurs negotiating a perilous prehistoric world, collected $ 1.5 million. Rounding out the Top 10 were the failed `` My Stepmother is an Alien,'' with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON> as an extraterrestrial beauty, and `` Ernest Saves Christmas,'' with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Varney </PERSON>. `` My Stepmother,'' dropping to ninth place from seventh a week ago, grossed just $ 1.1 million in its second week of release, while `` Ernest,'' at No. 10, took in $ 950,000. The holiday film season grows even more frantic this week, as studios release their `` prestige'' titles to qualify for the Academy Awards. Movies opening this week, some only in selected cities, include `` Beaches,'' `` Working Girl,'' `` Talk Radio,'' `` The Accidental Tourist,'' `` Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' `` Burning Secret,'' `` Dangerous Liaisons,'' `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' `` The Boost'' and `` Pelle the Conqueror.''

<HEAD>Relatives of Victims Curse Government On Anniversary Of Ferry
Disaster</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of people wailed and called down a curse on the government and a shipping line today in emotional ceremonies marking the first anniversary of history's worst peacetime disaster at sea The 300 protesters were marking the Dec. 20, 1987, sinking of the ferry <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> and the oil tanker Vector, which collided and exploded off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> island, leaving more than 3,000 people dead. `` In the name of all our loved ones, wherever they are, we swear that all those responsible shall be made to pay for the deaths and injustices they caused,'' the crowd chanted in unison. `` We will not lose hope until all those responsible are punished.'' A presidential commission said at least 3,563 people were aboard the two ships, but only 26 survived. Survivors and relatives claim the government and the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>'s owners, <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, have not provided adequate compensation nor taken steps to prevent other maritime disasters. The protesters, including at least four survivors and relatives of <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> victims, assembled at a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s church for a Mass, then marched toward President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s office at Malacanang Palace. About 20 police officers and vehicles blocked the marchers at a bridge about 600 feet from the palace but permitted the marchers to hold a rally. After speeches, the protesters lit candles and set fire to papier-mache models of the two ships. Two men slit the throats of two chickens and spattered the models with the blood. As the flames triggered firecrackers inside the models, hundreds wailed and began reciting the curse, traditional among people of the central <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> islands from where most of the victims came. During the rally, survivor <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galang </PERSON> told the crowd that the <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> had offered him money to testify that the oil tanker was at fault but he refused. `` They think they can buy lives with their money,'' he said. He said the survivors were being victimized by owners `` and this uncaring government.'' Speaker <PERSON> Ildefonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Aresala </PERSON>, who said he lost his entire family in the disaster, said his claims for compensation had been bogged down by paperwork. `` I thought the president would be able to help, but I was mistaken,'' he said. `` There's no clear solution. This is very painful for us. I do n't know what kind of law we have.'' Other relatives of victims claimed the government was simply pressuring them into accepting inadequate compensation offered by the ship owners. `` For as long as the government adopts a system that favors the interests of greedy capitalists, corruption will continue endlessly and sea travelers will never be safe,'' said one leaflet distributed in the crowd. <PERSON> Nazzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Cajolo </PERSON>, who claimed he lost five brothers in the disaster, said Sulpicio offered a $ 7,500 settlement but his family rejected it. `` Now they say my brothers are alive,'' he added. `` We want this government to listen to us and not avoid us.'' Cajolo is one of about 300 people who have filed a class suit against <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Philippine domestic shipping company. The suit was rejected by a lower court but an appeal is pending. In October, another Sulpicio passenger ship, the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, sank during Typhoon Ruby with about 500 people aboard. About half those aboard died or are missing.

 The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today, while share prices rebounded moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 124.70 yen, up 0.68 yen from Monday's close of 124.02 yen. After opening at 124.45 yen, the currency moved in a range of 124.30 to 124.80 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its rise on the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> market, which opened earlier, dealers said. <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> said the dollar-yen rate hardly moved in the morning session, but increased dollar-buying by speculative investors and trading companies in the afternoon pushed the dollar up. `` There was no economic factor in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that raised the dollar today, but its firmness on overseas markets encouraged investors' buying,'' <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> added On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 66.63-point loser Monday, climbed 97.86 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 29,567.94. Dealers attributed the index's quick rise in the morning to an overnight gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Nikkei gained 151 points in the morning session, but eased somewhat in the afternoon as buying interest fell, dealers said. Most institutional investors were sitting on the sidelines in the afternoon due to uncertainties over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate, said a dealer at one major securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trading was thin with volume on the first section estimated at 650 million shares.

 Eighteen candidates will vie for the mayor's office, but the failure of ex-Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and another former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> powerhouse to go after the Republican nomination leaves the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> without a big-name contender Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a Democrat in the city's top post from 1979 to 1983, sent word through her daughter to waiting reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that she would not pursue the Republican nomination, as had been rumored. `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> is not a candidate. Merry Christmas,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> told reporters, then departed. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman turned Republican who also was said to be considering a bid, sent an aide to tell reporters minutes before Monday's filing deadline for nomination petitions that he, too, is not interested. Seven Democrats and 11 Republicans filed petitions to appear on the ballot in the Feb. 28 primary election. The April 4 general election will decide who will complete the remaining two years of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s four-year term. Independent candidates have until mid-January to file. On the Democratic side, Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, named to the post by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> died of a heart attack in November 1987, will square off against <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the legendary Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who are black, are battling to represent the black community, although <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> also has begun campaigning hard for the black vote. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is slightly more than 40 percent white, 40 percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of other races.

Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was derailed in her 1983 re-election bid when she and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> split the white vote, allowing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to take the Democratic nomination. The decisions by Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> not to run was a disappointment for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders.

 A police officer who survived a gunshot blast to the chest in 1986 and saved a man from an ax-wielding assailant in 1985 collapsed and died while jogging. <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Olvera </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 27, who received 19 commendations in less than five years in uniform, collapsed as he jogged Monday morning. `` It's a terrible loss to the city and everyone who knew him,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. `` We have lost a very fine young officer who will be difficult to replace.'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, said an aneurysm in the right side of the officer's brain burst. An aneurysm is a balloon-type swelling of a blood vessel, <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON> said. In December 1985, Olvera and another officer were forced to shoot a man who was attacking another man with an ax at a housing project. The attacker died and the officers were credited with saving the life of the intended victim. Only two months later, <PERSON> Olvera </PERSON> stopped a burglary suspect who had been fleeing from officers by ramming his patrol car into the suspect's car. In 1986, a man whom <PERSON> Olvera </PERSON> was frisking pulled out a gun and fired at Olvera's chest. The bullet was deflected by a bulletproof vest. Olvera's work earned him the title of 1986 Officer of the Year from a local club and 1986 Central Texas Law Officer of the Year from a law enforcement group. Olvera in 1987 joined the <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, a team of investigators who gained a reputation for solving tough crimes.

 Jury selection is underway in the trial of five of the 13 civil rights leaders arrested for trying to block a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting in June. More than 20 jurors were interviewed Monday as city prosecutors and defense lawyers tried to seat an eight-member panel in Municipal Court. The five ministers on trial are each charged with one count of obstructing official business. The charge is a second-degree misdemeanor, with a maximum sentence of three months in jail and a $ 750 fine. The five defendants are among 13 ministers and civil rights leaders who were arrested after they refused to leave <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> chambers during the protest of the city's handling of problems in its Community Development Department. One black Community Development Department official was fired, another resigned, one retired and one was reassigned because of alleged mismanagment of the city's housing programs. The civil rights leaders wanted to know why the men were reprimanded without being consulted about problems in the department. They also asked for a public hearing into the allegations. Their requests were rejected by city officials and that sparked months of protest by civil rights leaders, who claim there is a conspiracy against black officials in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. The other eight defendants are scheduled for trial next month.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> without a single passenger after a six-hour delay prompted ticket holders to switch to another flight, an airline spokesman said today. `` We have no control on the passengers.

The jumbo jet, capable of carrying 264 passengers, carried a 14-member crew and 34 tons of cargo. It cost the airline $ 54,000 to make the one-way flight to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahatre </PERSON> said. He did n't know how much of that was offset by the cargo. `` The plane's return flight is fully booked, so we do not look that bad,'' he said.

The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the clemency was approved at a special Cabinet session. Ministry officials said 281 prisoners would be released Wednesday, including <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Boo-shik </PERSON>, who were serving 20-year sentences for leading a raid on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Cultural Center in the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> in early 1982. Protesters set fire to the building to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the government of then-President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. One person was killed and three were wounded. Another 1,581 people already freed on parole will have their civil rights restored Wednesday, 92 prisoners will have their sentences reduced, and 61 people who were sought by police will be taken off the wanted list, authorities said. Among those who will be granted restoration of civil rights is prominent dissident <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun-tae </PERSON>, who was freed from prison in June, He received the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in April. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was sentenced to five years in prison in 1986 for inciting unrest, but supporters alleged he was forced to confess by police torture. Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> said in a statement that the leniency was a `` bold step intended to heal the depressing wounds of the past era and thus to promote democratization.'' He said the action was taken through consultations with all major political parties, as had been promised by President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> pledged on Nov. 26 to release many political prisoners and institute other reforms to dissociate himself from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, his predecessor. The main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> said the government amnesty was an important step toward democratization, but party officials said there were still 60 more political prisoners to be freed. The <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, another opposition group, welcomed the measure, but dissident groups charged that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> betrayed his promise for a total release of political prisoners by excluding about 300 political prisoners, mostly involved in movements for workers and depressed people. Government officials disagreed and claimed the figure was about 200 who were involved mostly in communist spy cases and other anti-state activities.

<HEAD>Ex-Recruit Executive Pleads Guilty to Attempted Bribery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former executive pleaded guilty today to attempted bribery in the only case to come to criminal trial so far in a widening scandal over transactions in his company's stock involving leading politicians and businessmen. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON>, former chief aide to the president of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, admitted trying to bribe an opposition lawmaker who was investigating his company's role in the scandal. `` I admit all charges. They are all factual,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> as telling the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` I deeply regret my action and decided to accept charges in order to make a new start in my life.'' He also reiterated his earlier statement that he was acting on his own and that <PERSON> Recruit-Cosmos </PERSON>, a real estate subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had no part in the attemted bribery. Recruit is an information service conglomerate. `` It was all done by myself and the money came from my own savings and loans from my friends,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> arrested <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> on Oct. 20 for allegedly trying to give a $ 40,320 bribe to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Yanosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>, the leading investigator of the scandal. <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>, of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, filed a complaint with prosecutors saying he had been offered the cash in exchange for toning down his investigations and questioning in Parliament. The prosecution charged today that <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> acted out of fear that <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>'s investigation might damage <PERSON> Recruit-Cosmos </PERSON> as well as people who bought unlisted shares and then profited when public trading of the stock began. The scandal has led to the resignation of several goverment officials and business leaders, including Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The transactions in the unlisted Recruit-Cosmos shares were legal under Japanese law, but questions of ethics were raised against politicians and public officials who took advantage of their influence to earn handsome profits. The case also highlighted a traditionally intimate link between politicians and business circles in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Public anger in the wake of the scandal led Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to set up a committee to study possible revision of laws regulating political fund-raising activities. Another controversy erupted over Narazaki allowing a television camera into his residence to record the bribery offer. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> broadcast the tape on an evening news program. Following <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>'s complaint, prosecutors confiscated the tape from <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> as evidence. The company fiercely protested the action, saying it interfered with freedom of the press. <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> could face up to three years in prison on the bribery charge.

<TEXT>
 There are two Quacks now but no <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. The mystery of the purloined duckling deepened on Monday when a bronze duck stolen from a children's sculpture in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> more than a year ago was left at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> for police to find. But it was the wrong duck. To restore the sculpture, thieves must return a different duckling that was swiped on Dec. 10th. `` We're delighted to have Quack back but <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> is still missing,'' said the sculptor, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schon </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. She pleaded with the culprit to return <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> the duck before Christmas. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and Quack are two of eight bronze ducklings shown waddling after their mother in a sculpture dramatizing <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s well-known children's story, `` Make Way for Ducklings. In the story, a family of ducks wanders around the <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood before a friendly policeman helps them find a home in the Public Garden. Quack, the eighth duckling in the line, was stolen from the Garden while the cement was still setting on the sculpture in September 1987, <PERSON> Schon </PERSON> said. She replaced it and the ducklings remained untouched for more than a year. But this Dec. 10, while walking in the Garden, <PERSON> Schon </PERSON> noticed that <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, the fourth duck in the line, had disappeared. It had been cut off at the feet, apparenty with a blow torch, leaving only a telltale trace of bronze on the cobblestone. The ducklings each weigh about 30 pounds and are worth about $ 3,000. On Monday morning, <PERSON> Schon </PERSON> got a call from a friend saying the duckling had been found. A caller led police to the duck, which was in a cardboard box. `` I was joyous,'' she said. `` But when I went down to the police station I discovered it was not <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> but Quack.''

 Seven-year-old <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wiped tears from his eyes and told jurors how he fell paralyzed on his grandmother's doorstep while trying to flee gunfire in a drug war last summer. `` I was running to my grandmom's house ... I got to my front door and I fell down on my stomach and I could n't feel anything,'' the boy said in response to gentle questioning by Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rayford </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>. The child was unable to identify the defendant, <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, 21, as the gunman in the July 12 shooting, which has become a rallying point for residents fighting to reclaim their neighborhoods from drug dealers. After testifying Monday, the child told Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Halbert </PERSON> he felt `` fine'' after months of rehabilitation. The judge then shook his hand and wished him a Merry Christmas, earning a smile and a `` thanks'' from <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>. Summers' lawyer acknowledged the testimony would hurt his case, even if the boy did n't know who shot him. `` It's just the emotion that's involved, the sympathy that's generated The jurors are human beings,'' attorney <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinari </PERSON> said. Summers, charged with aggravated assault and weapons violations, has been held in jail in lieu of $ 1 million bail. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 30 years. The little boy, a second-grade public school student, has become a symbol in the city's war against drug trafficking. More than $ 43,000 already has been contributed for his future education. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, who is paralyzed below the waist, came into the courtroom in a wheelchair. He stared at the jury and then at the defendant, and tears began to flow as the judge and opposing lawyers discussed privately whether his testimony would be relevant and competent. The judge left the bench and sat beside the child, holding a microphone, while the youngster answered preliminary questions. `` Do you know the difference between right and wrong?'' asked Means. `` Yes,'' the boy replied. `` What happens when you tell a lie?'' `` You get punished,'' he said. The judge then cut in, saying, `` I am perfectly satisfied with the competence of this witness.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> then told how he was playing with his 9-year-old sister <PERSON> Nashira </PERSON> and several children a few houses from his grandmother's home when the shooting began <PERSON> Nashira </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a fourth grader, testified that she tried to grab <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> and pull him into a neighbor's house but he broke loose. `` I heard the shots, pow, pow, pow ... they sounded like firecrackers, only louder,'' she said. Moments later, she said, she came outside and saw him lying on his stomach and screaming. <PERSON> Tinari </PERSON> acknowledged Summers might have been in the neighborhood when warring drug dealers exchanged gunfire, but he said <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> did not fire the shot that severed <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>'s spine and left him paralyzed below the waist.

 Soviet officials have received more foreign aid shipments than they can handle and donors should focus instead on sending money for rehabilitation of earthquake victims, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said. They called Monday for suspension of aid shipments to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> until further notice. There have been about 140 foreign relief flights. Two-thirds of 27,000 rail cars that carried relief material to the earthquake-stricken region have yet to be unloaded, said <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> societies. Another league official, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisselev </PERSON>, said that due to a lack of international coordination the donor response has been `` far too generous.'' `` I think there are more kidney dialysis machines per capita in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> than anywhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Kisselev </PERSON> said, citing news reports that said up to 75 machines were sent to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while only 20 were requested. They briefed reporters after returning from a two-day trip to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to check on the relief operations for victims from the Dec. 7 earthquake. `` We should n't send more supplies,'' <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said. `` And when I hear that dog teams were sent on Saturday or Sunday, I must protest.'' He said the Soviets will have to return some of the donations. International donations should focus on money for rehabilitation, particularly workshops to manufacture artificial limbs, <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said. Orthopedic centers are needed for 4,000 people who lost limbs, according to <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON>. Officials in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, however, are evaluating whether winter tents and additional transportation are still needed, he said. About 53,000 tents are in the area, according to Soviet figures quoted by the league. <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said he met with Soviet Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, and they agreed that stronger coordination between governments and private organizations is needed to ensure an efficient emergency program. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> also `` realized there is a need for rather thorough changes in the disaster response system in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said. `` Nobody has overall view of what has been sent off,'' <PERSON> Stenbaeck </PERSON> said of the global effort. `` It took a week to find out what has been stored in warehouses.'' The league, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, combines 147 national societies and musters worldwide relief in case of disasters. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> issued a list of construction material needed for rebuilding. The list included ceramic tiles, washstands and tubs for kitchens and bathrooms.

 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> fans still holding tickets for two 1977 concerts canceled because of his death can get refunds soon, the state director of unclaimed property said. Presley, who died on Aug. 16, 1977, at his home in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, was scheduled for hometown performances on Aug. 27 and 28. Many of the fans who bought tickets for those shows, for $ 12.50 to $ 15 each, have never gotten their money back and it has been held in a savings account, said <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, director of the Mid-South Coliseum. The unclaimed ticket money, which originally totaled $ 150,000, has grown with interest to some $ 411,000, May said.

 The release of a woman jailed for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her son was blocked when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> stayed a <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> order. Acting at the request of the state attorney general's office, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> stayed the appelate ruling Monday pending a response from <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s attorneys by noon Wednesday, said <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s highest court had ruled 5-2 earlier Monday that Circuit Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> violated Ms. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s constitutional protection against self-incrimination by sending her to jail <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> found Ms. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>, 21, guilty of contempt for refusing to tell social workers last April where they could find her 27-month-old son, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>. She has remained in jail sine then. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> put the child in foster care after he was admitted to a hospital on Jan. 23, 1987, at the age of three months with a broken leg and several partially healed fractures. The department returned the child to Ms. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> the following August when she agreed not to physically punish the boy and to undergo training in how to be a parent. Last April, the department filed a petition saying the child had not been seen since September 1987 and that Ms. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> had refused to disclose his whereabouts. The petition also said the boy's father had been shot to death and that Ms. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON> had a history of drug abuse. The appeals court's majority opinion by Chief Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> noted that prosecutors fear <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> is dead or has been abused. `` The state readily acknowledges that <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s risk of incriminating herself is a substantial one, encompassing, among other possible crimes, the felony of child abuse and even murder,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, adding that the court ca n't ignore her constitutional protection against self-incrimination. A dissenting opinion by judges <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodowsky </PERSON> rejected the notion that she would be incriminating herself by revealing her son's whereabouts. The state's brief in the case argued that the importance of protecting the child outweighed Ms. <PERSON> Bouknight </PERSON>'s right not to incriminate herself.

<HEAD>Report Says Palme's Widow Identified Suspect From Videotape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The widow of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, the only witness to her husband's assassination, identified the killer from a videotape last week, a newspaper reported today. The account by <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was the main evidence that persuaded a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> district court to order that <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 41, be held in custody Friday, said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Prosecutors, police and <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s defense attorney refused comment on the report. Prosecutor <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON> complained that publicity about the case could put Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s life in danger. Swedish television also reported Monday that Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> had identified the gunman, but it gave no details. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who was prime minister for 11 years, was gunned down on a downtown Stockholm street while walking home from a movie with his wife the night of Feb. 28, 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was grazed by a second bullet. <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> said two other witnesses identified <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as the man seen loitering outside the Grand Theater before the killing. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> pleaded innocent at his arraignment, but the court found the prosecution had shown `` reasonable grounds for suspicion'' he committed the murder. Defense attorney <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON> has indicated he will argue against the reliability of eyewitness accounts after a nearly three-year time lapse. Failure to find the murder weapon, a .357 magnum revolver, also could complicate the prosecution, news reports said. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who has a long record of violent crimes and a history of drug and alcohol abuse, was picked up Wednesday after nearly a three-year manhunt. <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was reluctant to go through with the identification and relive the shooting but was persuaded `` by people outside the investigation'' to see a videotape. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> has persistently refused to publicly discuss the hunt for her husband's killer.

<HEAD>Results Released In Campaign Against Corrupt Foreign Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese officials who deal with foreign countries are the target of a massive anti-corruption campaign to remove their fingers from the public till, the nation's leading newspaper reported today. In all, 7,200 officials, 56 of whom were described as high-ranking government officials, have been punished in the campaign, the People's Daily said. Of these, 1,100 officials have had their cases referred to the nation's courts for criminal prosecution, it said. In one case, an engineer in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION> gave a foreign business classified documents about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s technological needs. In return, he was able to send his children to study in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to the report. In another case, 71 workers at an aluminum factory took 14 trips to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to research a single deal. In all, they spent $ 216,000 of government money on the trips, the newspaper said. `` In reality it was pure jobbery, using public funds for a tourist trip,'' the paper said. On Sunday, the paper reported that 30,000 inspectors were working in 3,000 officies nationwide to fight Chinese corruption in dealing with foreign companies. In all, 1.7 million foreign trade contracts involving $ 150 billion have been examined by officials, the paper said. Since the campaign began in June 1987, investigators have opened 15,600 cases, of which 7,500 have been solved, the paper said. `` In its work concerning foreign trade, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has some major weak links and loopholes,'' the People's Daily said. `` There really do exist some corrupt officials doing international trade. Politically and economically, they create a very bad impression.'' Corruption is one of the major problems <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> faces as it attempts to open its economy to the West. Western companies wishing to do business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are often forced by corrupt officials to pay bribes or offer gifts just for the chance to do business with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Internal corruption in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has also been blamed for causing price rises. Illegal companies, often set up by sons and daughters of powerful officials, buy goods at wholesale rates and sell them for a profit, increasing the goods' price. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s inflation hovers at about 20 percent to 30 percent, the highest since the revolution in 1949.

<HEAD>Police Seek Possible Links Between Department Store Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fire destroyed a large downtown department store, and officials said today they were investigating possible links with arson attacks at four other department stores. No injuries were reported in any of the incidents, which occurred late Monday and early today in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Welsh city of <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION> and the southwestern town of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, about 200 miles from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility in any of the incidents, but the domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> noted that animal rights activists opposed to the sale of furs have planted incendiary devices in the past at some of the targeted stores. The fire at Dingles department store in the center of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> gutted the 150-foot-high building. A total of 140 firemen battled for six hours to put out the flames. The blaze broke out late Monday after the 450 employees had gone home, fire officials said. Walls of the building collapsed, piling tons of rubble on fire engines at the scene. `` We have no indication as to how it started yet. It is one of the worst fires I have ever seen in the city center,'' said the police department's chief investigator, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mechan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said incendiary devices started small fires at <ORGANIZATION> Harrods </ORGANIZATION> department store in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Knightsbridge </LOCATION> district and at Selfridges, another large <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> department store, shortly after midnight. In each case, the device had been hidden down the side of a sofa in the furniture department, investigators said. They said damage was limited to the sofas. Similar incidents occurred at both stores in April. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard bomb squad officers also defused an incendiary device found at the House of Fraser store on Oxford Street before it went off. In <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> late Monday, a fire broke out in the menswear department at the <ORGANIZATION> Howells </ORGANIZATION> department store, police said. The fire was quickly put out, according to a police statement. `` There is no indication as to the cause, but obviously it is being treated as suspicious,'' the statement said. It said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> police would be talking with police in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> to see if there was a link between the fires and discovery of incendiary devices.

<HEAD>Pope Names Berlin Cardinal To Cologne and Ends Standoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today appointed <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archdiocese of <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the most influential church posts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The appointment ended a 15-month standoff between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and clerics in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> was reportedly long backed by the pope but had been opposed by some clerics in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> who are given a say in the selection process under a 1929 agreement between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the state of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>. Reports from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said some <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> churchmen viewed <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> as too conservative. Several West German politicians also spoke out against the pope insisting on his man. However, last Friday the clerics of the 16-member Cologne chapter elected <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, clearing the way for Tuesday's <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announcement. <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, who will be 55 on Christmas, lives in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> but is bishop of both sides of the divided city. He has served as <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> bishop since April 1980 and was promoted to cardinal by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> three years later. The <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> archbishop's post has been vacant since Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeffner </PERSON> retired in September 1987. He died one month later. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announcement gave no hint of the controversy surrounding the nomination. It noted, however, that the appointment was made in conformity with the 1929 agreement. On Dec. 10, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> made a rare public statement about an archbishop's appointment, declaring that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> had the right to name the <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> prelate even if the local church was opposed to his choice. <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> is considered particularly influential because its archbishop has traditionally headed the West German bishops conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wields considerable influence at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and is the major financial contributor after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The company that owns the song `` Happy Birthday to You'' is being sold for $ 25 million to the largest music publisher in the world, according to a report published today. <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the birthday song, will soon be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chappell </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the rights to songs by <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> is a division of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was put up for sale in October, in part because the company said it did not have the resources to monitor and protect its copyrights as larger companies do, the Times said Technically, a royalty should be paid every time the birthday song is sung in public, but the company has never monitored that kind of use. `` Happy Birthday'' generates about $ 1 million a year in royalty fees. Royalties were paid, for example, when the song was used in the films `` 10,'' `` The <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santini </LOCATION>,'' `` Oh God'' and `` Fame.'' `` Happy Birthday to You'' was based on a melody composed in the 1890s by two kindergarten teachers in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky. The song's lyrics were written later and the song was not copyrighted until 1935 When the copyright expires in 2010, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> will no longer be entitled to royalties. <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700 are actively collecting royalty fees, the Times said.

<HEAD>UNICEF: Debt Crisis Responsible For Half A Million Child Deaths
Annually</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with report released, Grant quotes. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than half a million children died in 16 developing nations last year because their debt-burdened governments have had to cut back on social spending, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> said today in its annual report. <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> called for a world summit to save an estimated 3 million children who he said die each year from easily preventable diseases. Formally releasing the report during a worldwide telecast, he said leaders of industrialized and developing nations should participate in the summit. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said cuts in social spending have led to problems that overshadow substantial progress made by most developing nations in health and education in the past decade. `` Three million children died last year because they did n't have 50 cents worth of vaccine in them,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> told a televised news conference relayed to 40 countries. He said 1.5 million of these deaths occurred in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said he proposed the summit because the way to reach the victims is to first reach their leaders. In the <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> annual report, `` The State of the World's Children 1989,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> cited the debts incurred by developing nations and said: `` By far, the heaviest consequences are being borne by the children.'' Throughout most of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, average incomes have fallen by 10 percent to 25 percent in the 1980s, the report says. In the 37 poorest nations, per capita spending on health has dropped by 50 percent and on education by 25 percent over the last few years, it adds. `` Children are facing the worst of times and potentially the best of times. It is the worst of times because 35 years of progress is being threatened by falling commodity prices, mismanagement and the debt crisis,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> before releasing the report. `` A country can do incredible things with a small amount of money as long as the economy holds together. When a country's economy starts having trouble, the children are always the ones who will suffer the most,'' he said. Ten deeply indebted Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations and six in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have experienced a slowing down in the reduction of mortality in children under age 5 from 1980 to 1987, compared with the 1970s. `` For these 16 countries alone, the number of child deaths in the last 12 months is approximately 650,000 more than would have been the case if the 1970-80 rate of decline in under-five mortality had continued,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. He said the majority of these deaths are related to `` the slowing down or reversal of the development process during the 1980s, which is a result of unprecedented borrowing, rising interest rates, falling commodity prices, inadequate investment of borrowed funds, and the domestic and international management of the resulting debt crisis.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> report, `` the developing world is now transferring $ 20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it receives in new aid and loans.'' Developing nations owe an estimated $ 1.2 trillion to private banks, development funds, and other countries. At the beginning of the 1980s, less than 5 percent of the Third World's children were immunized and diseases such as whooping cough, measles and tetanus killed up to 5 million children annually, the report says. Now, more than half the developing world's children are immunized and vaccines save the lives of about 1.5 million of them each year, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> reports. A new <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> goal is the immunization of pregnant women against tetanus, which extends protection to their newborns. The report says just 25 percent of them are now immunized, and tetanus kills more than 800,000 infants annually. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> launched a campaign to reduce the death rate from dehydration caused by diarrhea, which then claimed the lives of 4 million children annually. By promoting the use of inexpensive Oral Rehydration Salts, a simple method for preventing almost all dehydration deaths, 112 nations now are saving the lives of up to 1 million children annually, the report says.

<HEAD>Official Says Ruble Exchange Rate Won't Go Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The top trade official in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government today denied the ruble will be devalued by 50 percent in 1990, as had been widely assumed in the West from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media reports in the past two weeks. The newspaper articles, starting with one in <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Industria </LOCATION>, or Soviet Industry, had said the ruble exchange rate would fall by 50 percent `` on trade deals'' starting Jan. 1, 1990. Western economists and businessmen assumed this meant a drop from the current government-decreed exchange rate of $ 1.60 per ruble to 80 cents per ruble. But that applies only to the ruble's value in domestic deals among Soviet enterprises, not to its value in trade with foreigners, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamentsev </PERSON>, Deputy Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> and head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told a press briefing. `` This should not be taken as a change in the ruble standard versus foreign currency,'' <PERSON> Kamentsev </PERSON> said. He said the 50 percent change applies only to exchanges of foreign currency between various Soviet businesses, government-owned and cooperative. A Western diplomat, who declined to be named, noted at the time of the original report that it did not say which exchange rate would drop, a critical distinction as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reputedly has 3,000 different exchange rates for different products and different trading partners. <PERSON> Kamentsev </PERSON> refused to clarify that question. <PERSON> Kamentsev </PERSON> said, however, that the current change is one step in the direction of a ruble that someday will be freely convertible to foreign currency. He declined to name a date for convertibility, but said it would come after a major price reform. Rubles now are virtually worthless outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviet government sells rubles to tourists and businessmen at a rate of $ 1.60 per ruble, but the black market rate is 25 to 30 cents per ruble. <PERSON> Kamentsev </PERSON> also said that starting next year, Soviet enterprises will be allowed to trade their foreign currency with other Soviet businesses in a thrice-yearly currency auction. However, he did not explain how the apparently open prices of an auction would co-exist with a set rate.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministers Hold Heated Talks on Territorial Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet and Japanese foreign ministers held heated talks today over a territorial dispute but made no progress, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rebuffed Soviet feelers on increased economic cooperation, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and his counterpart, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, were to give separate news conferences Wednesday before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> leaves for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and officials of the two countries were drafting a jiong communique. But it appeared unlikely that progress could be realized on the major issue blocking improved relations _ Soviet possession of the Kuril islands off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> insists should be returned. The only positive sign was a possibility that the two countries would agree to continue talks at the official level on the dispute, which dates back to World War II. `` Neither side has shown concessions, so the positions are still far apart,'' <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, a Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told reporters in a review of two days of talks between the two foreign ministers. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in a speech Tuesday night to a private group, called for an improvement in relations. `` We can open up a new chapter in the history of Soviet-Japanese relations, and then again they must be opened up,'' he said. `` If there are problems that can not be solved between us, we must search for the clue to a solution through talks, dialogue.'' A Japanese Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was likely to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for renewed talks in the first half of 1989. <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON> said the Soviets had suggested the two countries study measures to encourage economic cooperation, such as agreements to protect investments and set guidelines on economic relations. The Japanese replied that, in addition to problems in the Soviet investment climate, `` the overall situation of bilateral relations is not suitable for further promotion of investment,'' <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON> said. His report on the talks appeared to dash speculation that a Soviet need for Japanese investment to help develop the Soviet economy _ especially the vast and resource-rich Siberian region in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ would spur progress on the territorial issue. <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON> said the two foreign ministers' talks on the territorial issue were `` frank, serious and heated.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has consolidated its occupation of the Kurils, which guard <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s access to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, with 10,000 troops. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> maintains that it pioneered settlement of the islands _ 17,000 Japanese residents were ousted by invading Soviet troops in 1945 _ and has a historic claim to them. Earlier, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to give `` serious consideration'' to the territorial dispute, a Foreign Ministry official said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said resolution of the dispute `` would be the basis for permanent and stable relations.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with the Japanese prime minister to deliver a letter from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The contents of the letter were not made public. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on his political schedule and that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was welcome to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Japanese official said. No dates were mentioned. In a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint declaration, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> announced its willingness to return two of the islands upon conclusion of a peace treaty. But at the last Japan-Soviet summit in 1973, talks between then Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> broke down over the issue. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> refused to discuss it during his last visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1986.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, today discussed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s troubled region of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said his country will not interfere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal The Indian leader spent much of his second day in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sightseeing. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> explained <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> during a one-hour meeting at the Great Hall of the People <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, 81, who has held the largely ceremonial post of president since April, stressed that the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government provides assistance to the Tibetan region, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most backward areas. `` We respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the Tibetan people, and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s position that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is an autonomous region of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will not interfere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said The Tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the two countries because <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has provided refuge to the Tibetan religious leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, and his followers, who have demanded independence for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959 after he led a failed uprising against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military forces. At least one Tibetan monk was shot and killed by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security forces during a demonstration in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> on Dec. 10. It was the third outbreak of anti-Chinese violence in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> in the past 14 months. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are trying to restore friendly ties after a quarter century of soured relations, which hit bottom during a 21-day border war in 1962. The border question was the main topic during talks Monday between <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims 36,000 square miles of what <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says is part of its northeast state of <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> claims 14,500 square miles of land seized by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1962. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, however, vowed not to let the border problem interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is the first Indian leader to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since his grandfather, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Jawalharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, came in 1954. Accomapnied by his Italian-born wife, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> today traveled about 37 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to the Badaling section of the Great Wall, the 3,720-mile-long barrier built over a 2,000-year period to keep out invaders. The Indian leader also visited the Temple of Heaven, a 15th century structure where <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emperors once prayed for good harvests and performed sacrificial rituals. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is scheduled to meet 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thailand to Open Repatriation Camp for Burmese Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has announced it will open a transition camp for <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students who had fled the military crackdown in their country and now want to return home. The agreement to open the camp was reached in talks last week between the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leader, Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, and Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> army chief who was the first foreign dignitary to visit <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since the Sept. 18 coup. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON>, speaking on army-run Channel 5 television, said the camp would be opened Wednesday at the airport in the city of <LOCATION> Tak </LOCATION>, about 50 miles from the Burmese border. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> said last month it would send aircraft to transport the students who want to go home. `` The Thai government is worried about hardships on these students and has been assured by the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government of their safety when they return,'' he said. He said the students will receive medical examinations while they wait for repatriation at the camp administered by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> army and the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burmese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Students had been at the forefront of this year's pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, ruled by military autocracies for the past quarter century. Thousands of the protesters fled the cities after a bloody crackdown by the government. Thai officials said more than 7,000 Burmese students joined anti-government guerrilla groups based along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. The rebels have been waging a four-decade war for greater autonomy. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> said about 300 of the students had made their way from the border to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, 30 Burmese students met with <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and asked his help in arranging a meeting between them and <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> to discuss his request that they return. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Wednesday marked a break in the informal international agreement to refrain from any moves that might imply recognition of the Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> government. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Prapas </PERSON> <PERSON> Limpabandhu </PERSON>, told reporters today that he will visit <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> `` to tell them we want to see <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> develop democracy.'' No date has been set. Asked if his visit meant Thai recognition of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Prapas </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> remains open, and that means recognition.

<HEAD>Transit Authority Proposes No-Pockets Approach To Fighting Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City transit officials have come up with a simple solution they say will make it harder for employees to pocket bus fares _ eliminate employees' pockets. `` Opportunity makes the thief,'' <PERSON> Gordana </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> board, said Monday as she endorsed a plan to distribute pocketless uniforms to all workers who handle bus fares. Many workers who handle the money already wear such uniforms. For those who do n't, Ms. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> suggested sewing shut the pockets on their clothes until new uniforms can be provided. The workers who still have pockets remove fare boxes from buses with special keys and put the money in carts. The carts are then delivered to armored trucks, which take the cash to the transit authority's counting rooms. The new uniforms were one of several recommendations Transit Authority General Manager <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pegg </PERSON> made in response to an audit warning of `` casual pilferage and organized theft'' of fare-box revenue. Estimates of annual losses range from thousands to millions of dollars. Auditors said most of the losses occurred in the counting rooms, where they said they saw money lying loose on the floors. In addition, workers who count fares were allowed to leave the building without being checked by security guards, auditors said.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two main political blocs agreed to maintain their longstanding refusal to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in their new coalition government, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said today. The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were expected to initial their coalition pact today after negotiators agree on final details of foreign and economic policy. The formal signing is expected in a day or two. The agreement Monday to form another coalition resolved a seven-week stalemate after national elections Nov. 1 in which neither party received a clear mandate. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and Labor won 39. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who spoke to reporters after Labor ministers ratified the agreement, said the pact reiterates the guidelines of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s outgoing government `` that there will be no negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The ban was maintained despite a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision last week to open a `` substantive dialogue'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The decision stunned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The agreement also does not require the government to fulfill a demand by religious parties to pass a law that would narrow the definition of a Jew to exclude those converted by non-Orthodox rabbis. The ammendment to the so-called Law of Return, which fixes eligibility for Israeli citizenship, deeplu angered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews, most of whom are non-Orthodox. `` The government will work to keep the Jewish people united. This brings an end to a change in the Law of Return,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. The new Cabinet, to be headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to command a majority of up to 97 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, including several smaller religious parties expected to join. It will contain 24 or 25 ministers, 10 each for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor with the remainder going to the smaller parties. Most key posts will be held by the same officials as in the last government, with <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> remaining defense minister and <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> industry minister. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, will become finance minister. The party chose the post for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> so they would have a springboard for funneling money to the nation's ailing collective farms, or kibbutzim, many of which are aligned with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, and a string of industries owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. The Hadashot newspaper said the government's new program calls for a peace initiative `` aspiring for direct negotiations with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and a delegation of Palestinians made up of leaders from the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories.'' The program vows to `` act aggressively to restore security in the territories,'' and says all political peace initiatives would have to be approved in advance by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> each needed a crucial vote of approval from their parties' central committees before the agreement could be signed and a government installed. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> faced a stormy reception from his party's central committee. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has already come under criticism from party hardliners such as <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a former defense minister, who expressed concern that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s conciliatory stance would bring about an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Palestinians have been in revolt for a year. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today that because <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> favors a partial withdrawal from the occupied territories, a government with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> was `` liable to bring about establishment of a PLO-Palestinian state and a continued Arab onslaught on the rest of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He blamed `` daily attacks on Jews'' and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for the political deadlock between the two parties, which have governed jointly since 1984. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s decision to join forces with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night by saying he thought <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> should be defense minister instead of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, Israeli news media reported. He reportedly accused <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of failing to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> to `` take responsibility and rule.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reportedly replied by saying, `` if the defense portfolio were in <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s hands, we would have serious problems in the army.'' At least 332 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed in the Arab revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s highest court today ordered a new inquest into the deaths of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members shot by police six years ago. The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled that the three police officers who fired the shots can be forced to testify at the new hearing. No date has been set. But Sir <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, the chief justice, made it clear that the police officers _ who have been acquitted of murdering one of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members _ can refuse to testify on grounds of possible self-incrimination. The original inquest was adjourned in late November. The three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, the province's police force, were among five police officers involved in the ambush on <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Gervase </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Toman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The three men allegedly failed to stop their car at a police checkpoint in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> in November 1982. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerr </PERSON>, the widow of one of the victims, fought to have the courts order the police officers to testify and be cross-examined rather than submit written statements. Coroner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> had ruled he had no power to compel the police officers to appear in person. However, his original inquest has been scrapped and the jury discharged. Inquests also are to be held into the deaths of three other unarmed Roman Catholics _ two of them guerrillas and the third a teen-age civilian _ who died in two separate police ambushes in 1982. Police said all the deaths occurred in the normal course of anti-terrorist activity, but subsequent evidence suggested the killings might have been avoided and that police were operating under a `` shoot-to-kill'' policy. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to oust <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the majority <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

The radicals have denounced the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief's explicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements, made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week, led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open an official dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banned <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> contacts 13 years ago. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> today as part of his bid to gain international support for his peace initiative. Opposition to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s campaign, which is aimed at securing an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, appeared to be gathering momentum among Palestinians who believe he has made too many concessions. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has stressed it will break off talks if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> carries out terrorist attacks. While attacks by non-PLO factions may fall outside that condition, they could seriously undermine <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s initiative The factions meeting in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> included the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, led by former <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, the Fatah-Uprising of Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> and the small Saiqa group, the source said. He said the radicals had formed a committee to discuss ways of ousting <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his allies to install a militant leadership `` which will adhere firmly to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter and sponsor the armed struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as the only way to liberate the occupied territories.'' The committee, he claimed, includes some leaders of the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and `` various Palestinian personalities, most of whom held senior posts in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' He did not identify them further. On Monday, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body reflected a possible serious split in the organization's top ranks by calling <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal opinion.'' <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's statements last week were `` incompatible with the resolutions of the latest <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting.'' The council, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, met in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> last month to declare an independent Palestinian state. It indirectly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and condemned terrorism, but did not go far enough to gain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is an umbrella organization of eight different Palestinian guerrilla factions dominated by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims it is bent on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction. <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s statement could represent serious dissent because of his seat on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member executive commitee, which includes representatives of six Palestinian guerrilla groups as well as independents. Fatah has three seats. <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON> is the sole committee representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-backed Marxist group headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, who told <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting that his faction does not believe in moderation. It was not immediately known whether <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s statement, which was signed with <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>'s guerrilla name, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> The statement was delivered from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, to The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The office of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> confirmed the statement.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, vowing to halt ethnic violence on this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island, was elected president with slightly more than half the votes, the government said today. Earlier today, Sinhalese extremists hacked and shot to death nine supporters of <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a town east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. `` The politics of terror has no place in the temple of democracy,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said in a televised address immediately after the announcement. `` I will eradicate fear and suppresion. I will restore law and order.'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> received 50.4 percent of the vote in Monday's election, edging former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of the opposition <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to Commissioner of Elections <PERSON> Chandrananda </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has vowed to remove controversial Indian peacekeeping troops when he takes over <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s most powerful government post Jan. 2 for a six-year term. Ms. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> had no immediate comment on the balloting, and a man who answered the phone at her home said she was ill. But one of her close allies said she had described the results as `` unjust'' and would not accept them. The associate spoke on condition of anonymity and would not elaborate. As promised, outgoing President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> today dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and called new legislative elections for Feb. 15. He ordered an islandwide curfew to take effect after the official election results were announced. `` I particularly wish to ask, to appeal, to those who belong to the winning side, to treat your opponents who have lost with friendship, affection and love,'' he said. With all 182 polling districts counted, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> had 2,569,199 votes, or 50.4 percent, compared with 2,299,770, or 45 percent for Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, the election commissioner said. The remaining votes went to a leftist coalition candidate, <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonesekera </PERSON>. The turnout was 55 percent, well below the nationwide rate of 80 percent in the 1982 presidential election as a campaign of imitidation by extremists apparently kept many people at home. Officials have blamed Sinhalese extremists of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the recent campaign of terror The extremists had threatened to kill anyone who voted on Monday. The military reported five Indian troops were killed in an ambush by Tamil ethnic minority rebels Monday, bringing the reported election day death toll to at least 20. Today's attacks occurred in <LOCATION> Bandarawela </LOCATION>, about 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, local authorities said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They did not elaborate. The threats kept thousands from the polls. In the north, where militants of the Tamil minority are fighting for an independent state, many voting districts reported less than 10 percent turnout. And in the south, where Sinhalese extremists oppose government concessions to the Tamils, turnout ranged from 20 percent to 70 percent. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was the standard-bearer for the party of <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term. Under <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s rule, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> neared the brink of ruin because of ethnic violence that has killed nearly 10,000 people since 1983, when Tamils began an uprising against the Sinhalese. With the help of neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> _ the subcontinent's superpower and home to 60 million Tamils _ <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed a peace accord in July 1987 aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency The pact guaranteed some autonomy to the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people _ and invited <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to help end the uprising by sending troops, which now number about 47,000. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> vehemently opposed the pact and vowed to kill anyone who supported the government after it was signed. The front has been blamed for hundreds of slayings since. Both <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, who was prime minister in 1960-66 and 1970-77, opposed the Tamil accord. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has called for the phased or immediate withdrawal of Indian troops. But Indian High Commissioner J.N. <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> has indicated his country will not accept unilateral action. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> also campaigned as a champion of the poor and has promised a monthly $ 75 to the country's most impoverished families. He did not explain where the money would come from.

<TEXT>
 A witness in the trial of confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> testified today that a pistol used in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner may have been smuggled onto the plane inside a fish. <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Posiege </PERSON>, 31, a West German federal police investigator, also told the court that information gathered by Greek police indicated hand grenades on the plane may have been smuggled in with a bunch of fruit. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with air piracy and murder in the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage 17 days during the ordeal. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot and killed by the hijackers after the Athens-to-Rome flight was hijacked on June 14, 1985. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He has testified that his accomplice, identified in court records as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Posiege </PERSON> said she traveled to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> after the hijacking to ask <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> police about their arrest of another man who officials said planned to join the two other hijackers but failed to get on the flight. Ms. <PERSON> Posiege </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> police identified the arrested man as <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwa </PERSON>, who had been taken into custody `` because he was acting suspiciously.'' `` They would n't give any other details on why he was arrested,'' she told the court. Under questioning, she said, `` <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwa </PERSON> told them -LRB- <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> investigators -RRB- the pistol was smuggled aboard the hijacked plane in a fish, and the grenades were between some fruit,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Posiege </PERSON>. However, she said <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> police told her they did not believe <PERSON> Atwa </PERSON>'s story. `` They were convinced that their airport security measures were adequate, and that the weapons were placed on board the airliner in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, from where it had arrived earlier,'' Ms. <PERSON> Posiege </PERSON> said. During the hijacking ordeal, the plane was forced to land three times in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and twice in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed when the plane landed the second time in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot, the hijackers forced the airliner to return to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwa </PERSON> was flown there and released in exchange for all <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> passengers and the remaining women and children on the plane, court records indicate. Ms. <PERSON> Posiege </PERSON> identifed the Greek officials she talked with only as the heads of the anti-terror, security, and <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Also today, a written deposition from an American passenger aboard the hijacked plane was read into the court record. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucchi </PERSON>'s description of the ordeal, including beatings of passengers and the shooting of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, echoed those of dozens of other witnesses who have testified earlier at the trial, which began on July 5 in a high security courtroom in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said today the court would honor a defense request to try to obtain more detailed reports on the hijacking from international aviation organizations who may have monitored radio transmissions with the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner. Among those to be contacted were the U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>.

 Organizers of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural parade passed over what was judged one of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s best high school bands in favor of the school that serves <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summer home. It's `` a rotten, stinking deal,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, the head of the boosters' club for the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> band. The 77-member band, located in this western <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> town, submitted video and audio tapes of its performances to the inaugural committee. The committee had said selections would be based on merit, including past achievements, and the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> band believed its victory last month in the annual <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> competition would give it the edge. But <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> learned Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> band was rejected. Instead, the only <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> band picked to play in the parade was the one from <ORGANIZATION> Kennebunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which serves students from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> and other supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> band complained to members of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation that political considerations outweighed other factors in the band's selection. `` People are enraged,'' said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>. The leader of the <LOCATION> Kennebunk </LOCATION> band made no apologies. `` I ca n't help it if our band is from <LOCATION> Kennebunk </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewia </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure there were political connections. That's just the way the ball bounces.'' <PERSON> Lewia </PERSON>'s band has not competed in the state competition, but he said it has participated in regional competitions outside <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` We're not some scrub band,'' he said. `` We're a good band.''

<HEAD>U.S. Making Diplomatic Efforts To Stop Libyan Chemical Weapons
Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is making diplomatic efforts to dissuade other nations and private companies from selling <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> materials needed to start up its huge chemical weapons plant, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top counter-terrorism official said today. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Monday that the Libyan plant was `` on the verge of full-scale production,'' and <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, head of the department's counter-terrorism office, said official are concerned its products might get into the hands of terrorist groups around the world. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, interviewed today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' said there have been discussions with several countries in what he described as `` a major diplomatic effort to try to persuade companies and countries around the world not to sell the kind of precursors that are necessary for chemical weapons production to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has denied his country has developed the capability for chemical warfare. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview on Monday that <LOCATION> Lybia </LOCATION> has a `` long-standing, close relationship with some of the world's most murderous terrorist groups'' and has been willing to provide destructive weapons to those groups He said, however, there was no evidence the north African nation had distributed any chemical weapons to others. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials previously had acknowledged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern about a large chemical facility reportedly based in a mountain chain 35 miles from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast. `` We've been following the developments of this plant now for some time. It goes back even earlier than the first press reports about it in the fall,'' said <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think our objective now is to try to see if we ca n't persuade other people to stop providing the kind of chemical agents which are used in this kind of plant. That's the major objective now of our diplomacy,'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would use military action to prevent chemical weapons production in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to comment on what kind of military measures might be used.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has previously used military action against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, bombing <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in April 1986 in retaliation for the country's alleged role in terrorist acts. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> also urged progress toward a worldwide ban on chemical weapons at an international conference on disarmament scheduled to reconvene in February.

<HEAD>Report: Press Freedom Under Attack in Democracies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Press freedom came under attack in 1988 from some of its staunchest defenders _ democratic countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported. The plight of the media remained bleak under repressive regimes, but the trend in democrcies was the year's most worrisome development, the institute said in its annual `` World Press Freedom Review.'' `` One of the saddest truths facing the media around the world today is the growing trend toward government interference in democratic countries,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON>, the institute's director, wrote in the report's introduction. `` The hopes and encouragement of nations which are on their way towards more freedom and who rely on an example from countries with a democratic system, an open society and freedom, must not be crushed by governments in the free world,'' he said. The 32-page report cited `` significant improvements'' in press freedom in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and setbacks in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and other nations where journalism continues to be a sometimes dangerous and often difficult profession. While the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s policy of glasnost has meant `` heartening strides'' toward a more open press, restrictions on the reporting of subjects such as ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> have been a `` disgrace,'' the report said. The institute, which has offices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, is an independent body representing 2,000 publishers and editors in more than 60 countries. Its report this year detailed developments in 82 countries. In 1988, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration `` continued its efforts to limit public access to information held by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government,'' the report said. It cited as a `` blatant example'' of interference in the media the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s upholding of the conviction of a former intelligence analyst for giving satellite photographs of a Soviet ship to a British magazine. The analyst, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>, was sentenced to two years in prison. The report also criticized the new Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement for restricting Canadian journalists who can work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to those with a university degree and three years' experience `` Attempts to define qualifications for journalists ... pose a serious threat,'' it said, noting it was the first time the rule was `` enshrined in an international accord.'' In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the press scored a victory when Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government lost its court fight to prevent newspapers from publishing extracts from `` Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of former intelligence agent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. However, the report criticized <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ban on all radio and television interviews with 11 groups in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, including the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and its political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. The report called the ban `` the most drastic action taken against British broadcasters in peacetime.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was forced at the last minute to withdraw legislation that would have shifted the duty of proving defamation from plaintiffs to journalists, the report said. An Australian court ordered a journalist to reveal his sources, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s press had an `` appalling year,'' marked by three-month publication bans for two newspapers and a one-month ban on another, it said. Elsewhere, `` the media under dictatorships remained all too predictably under lock and key,'' the report noted. One of the worst years ever for the independent press in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was marked by violent assaults on 24 foreign and Chilean journalists. Five journalists were forced to leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> following the passage of an anti-terrorist law. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> cracked down on their press, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> continued to do so and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> soured a promising start by reasserting control and suppressing negative news, the report said. However, the South Korean press had a `` watershed year,'' with many visible and invisible restrictions lifted, and in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, economic and political liberalizations were extended to the media, the report said.

<HEAD>Life Sentence For Woman Involved In Burying Kidnap Victim Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman convicted in the kidnap-murder of businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, who suffocated when buried alive, was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. `` I just want to say I am not guilty of those charges, never was,'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michela </PERSON>. `` I am very sorry for what happened, for what I was associated with.'' The woman cried and hugged her mother after hearing the sentence. Small, a member of a prominent media family and great-grandson of a former <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> governor, was kidnapped Sept. 2, 1987. His body was unearthed two days later after his wife received a muffled telephone call seeking $ 1 million in ransom. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> was unable to understand the tape of her husband reading the ransom delivery instructions, and the money never was paid. `` There was not one grain of remorse, not one grain of salt in the tears of this woman for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> and his family,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON> told <PERSON> Michela </PERSON> before Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> was sentenced Monday. `` The crocodile tears we saw at the trial and those we see now are for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, not for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>.'' Prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, 26, joined with her boyfriend, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, in the plot. They said Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> lured Small from his home with a telephone call so he could be abducted by <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Small, 40, was taken to a remote area between <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> line, placed in a homemade wooden box with a breathing tube and buried. The ventilation system in the box failed and Small suffocated. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was convicted of murder and kidnapping in May and sentenced to die, but prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> was not eligible for the death penalty. Before her conviction Nov. 2, Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> claimed that witnesses against her had lied, and that she was the victim of mistaken identity. Small's late father was head of <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, whose properties included 11 radio stations, and his uncle was head of <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and editor and publisher of the The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>.

The move marks a change in course, since federal prosecutors had vowed to pursue the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> case regardless of the verdict in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The complex <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> case, which ended in a mistrial in May, included allegations of government infiltration of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> groups. A retrial is scheduled to begin Feb. 22. A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> jury on Friday found <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates guilty on all 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy for failing to repay $ 30 million in loans from supporters, including one woman who testified she lost $ 112,800 in life savings. `` The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> case is different,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, who also prosecuted the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> case. `` It charges different offenses and there is therefore no logical reason why it should not go forward. But an office-wide decision will have to be made after all appropriate people are consulted,'' he said Monday. The 66-year-old <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> faces up to 65 years in prison and $ 3.25 million in fines; sentencing in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is set for Jan. 27. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who has run for president four times, is known for his unconventional views, including supporting an AIDS quarantine and charging that former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and the Queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> have ties to drug trafficking. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five political organizations are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign raised more than $ 2 million through credit card and loan fraud. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> is charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with investigators. All the aides and organizations also are charged with conspiracy, and four of the groups are charged with fraud. Three more defendants are fugitives. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> called a mistrial after four jurors complained about the length and conduct of the case, which was repeatedly delayed by defense motions. The trial began a year ago. The new court date hinges on a federal appeals court ruling on whether the trial would violate defendants' protection against being tried twice on the same charges. Attorneys for both sides expect the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to support a new trial. Defense lawyers maintain the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> convictions make the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> case moot and that a retrial would waste government money. They long have charged that the case is politically motivated, an accusation prosecutors deny.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has taped a greeting for broadcast on Soviet television on New Year's Day and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to respond in kind, the White House said today. It would be the third time the two leaders have exchanged televised New Year's greetings. They began the practice in 1986 after their first summit meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In 1987, the Soviets declined to take part in such an exchange, saying U.S.-Soviet relations were not good enough to justify it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> taped a radio message that was broadcast over the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, but was jammed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The exchange was resumed in 1988. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president videotaped his message last week. He said the brief message `` does n't deal with policy issues.'' He said details are now being worked out with the Soviets and he anticipated that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks would be receiving a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tape for their consideration.

<HEAD>U.N. Conference Adopts Convention Against Illicit Drug Trafficking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference today an adopted an international convention against illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse that it hopes will deal an efficient blow to those who sell and use drugs. `` It's significant because it represents a commitment by over a hundred other nations to cooperate in fighting the problems of drug trafficking and drug abuse,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It's apparent that no one nation alone or within its own borders can deal with the multinational operations of the drug cartels,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The convention for the first time gives all signatory countries the right of extradition of suspected drug traffickers and the right to confiscate all their assets. The document, first conceived four years ago, was signed by 43 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at the close of the monthlong <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference. Sixty-three other nations participating in the closed-door gathering adopted the convention by consensus, according to <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuestenhage </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Information office. It may take several years for the new convention to become legally binding. To have legal force, it must be ratified by parliaments or other national bodies in the signatory countries, then given to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general for notification. Many conference delegates were optimistic. Asked how the new convention matched recent anti-drug legislation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` It's a very good fit.' The provisions on money laundering, confiscation of drug dealers' assets and cooperation in pursuing the traffickers are similar to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation signed last month, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would need only `` a minor adjustment'' to comply with Article 3 of the Convention, he added. That article deals with the identification, tracing, freezing and forfeiture of proceeds derived from drug trafficking. The article is seen as a major way to toughen two earlier international accords by cracking down on modern drug traffickers whose networks straddle the world and involve billions of dollars. The new document, known formally as the Convention Against Illicit Trafic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, complements the 1961 Convention on <ORGANIZATION> Narcotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> signed by 121 contries and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances so far ratified by 88 countries. Besides providing for asset forfeiture and extradition, the new document foresees mutual legal assistance and cooperation in training police and customs officers fighting drugs. It also stipulates how to monitor substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of drugs, to eradicate illicit plant cultivation and suppress traffic by sea, in free-trade zones and free ports. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have preferred stronger language on extradition, with those engaged in crimes linked to drug trafficking eligible for extradition `` irrespective of their nationality whenever they may be found.'' A special international commission will be charged with monitoring implementation, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Asked about the cooperation of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, with its strict laws on banking secrecy, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had experience with <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> which proved `` very positive ... with regard to waiving bank secrecy laws when criminal conduct is involved.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to prevent two federal agencies from duplicating each other's work in setting safety standards for cleanup of hazardous materials, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a meeting is scheduled on the issue this week and a decision `` should be forthcoming fairly soo.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the problem of duplication arose as <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> considered proposed regulations by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> governing safety of state and local emergency workers involved in cleanup operations. A similar standard is being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to cover state and local goverment workers who are not under the jurisdication of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said this rule is not expected to be ready for about 90 days. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that he had `` grave concerns'' about reports that the budget agency was intervening in the matter and that `` excluding state and local employees from the final standard would deny coverage to the very people <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to protect.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> regulation is before <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` It is going through normal processing. We do n't feel there is any abnormal delay. There is no real opposition to the regulations.'' `` There is a meeting scheduled for the next few days to consider the two regulations and try to eliminate duplication wherever possible,'' he said. `` It should be forthcoming fairly soon.''

<TEXT>
 A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in the chilly waters off <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> after failing to migrate south this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to reunite it with its brethren. The dolphin, nicknamed <PERSON> Rascal </PERSON>, was spotted in early October in <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, and residents around the bay began requesting that the government do something to save it. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agreed that the animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to save it. `` It's only done in extreme circumstances when the welfare of the animal is believed to be in danger,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, special agent with the service in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>, a diving instructor at the bay, said <PERSON> Rascal </PERSON> has slowed down and become thinner. `` That's probably due to the food source probably drying up out there,'' she said. Divers hope to go into the bay Wednesday, trap the aquatic mammal and then deliver him for a flight to warmer waters off the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Earlier this fall, the plight of three whales icebound off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> attracted worldwide attention. One of the whales died, but the other two made it to open water after a Soviet icebreaker carved a path for them. <PERSON> Rascal </PERSON>'s rescue is to be supervised by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stranding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brigantine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, because he has captured dolphins before, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> had opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in the net or take in water and develop pneumonia. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, associate director for research at the institute, said today that it will work with <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> on the rescue effort. <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> agreed that a rescue is risky. `` You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if nothing's done,'' he said. `` That animal would die in the area if we did n't do anything.'' The dolphin is the second to become stranded in the bay in three years. <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> oversaw that rescue three years ago and helped save dolphins off the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast several years ago. An attempted rescue of a dolphin in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> a few years ago failed when the animal died of a heart attack, he said. <PERSON> Rascal </PERSON> may fare better, he said, because apparently it is young. Residents have said the animal may not have joined other dolphins in migrating south because it was frightened of bridge construction in a narrow channel that links the bay and open water.

 A jury today deliberated for the second day charges against three polygamist clan members in the slaying of a law-enforcement officer, who was killed after a 13-day siege at the clan's rural compound. The second-degree murder case went to the jury Monday night after more than six hours of instructions and closing arguments and nine days of testimony. Jurors deliberated three hours, then were sent home for the night. In closing arguments, prosecutor <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said clan patriarch <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, his brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, and brother-in-law <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22, deliberately chose a course of confrontation that led to bloodshed. The three are charged in the Jan. 28 death of <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. House was killed and <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> seriously wounded when a shootout ended the standoff at the clan's <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> farm that began Jan. 16, when <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> bombed a Mormon chapel. Under <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> law, the maximum penalty for second-degree murder is life in prison. The three defendants and <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, wife of the late clan patriarch <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, who was killed by authorities in 1979, have been sentenced to prison terms for federal violations in the bombing and standoff. <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> is the mother of <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s two wives. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> was sentenced to 15 years, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> to 10 years and <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> to five years. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> told jurors that <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> `` basically declared war on the church, state and nation'' when he bombed the chapel. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> contended he was divinely inspired to commit the act on the ninth anniversary of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s death, but <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> dismissed the clan leader's claims. `` God did n't place those weapons in their hands,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s co-counsel, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, countered that just because clan members were well-armed did not mean they intended to use their weapons. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> told jurors <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> was trying to `` divert your attention from the real issue _ it's about what -LRB- Addam Swapp -RRB- did with the guns. He did n't use them offensively.'' Singer has acknowleged firing the fatal bullet from his bedroom window, but maintained he was aiming at police dogs. Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Metos </PERSON>, representing Singer, called <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death a `` tragic accident'' born of his client's panicked attempt to protect the Swapp brothers from the dogs. <PERSON> Metos </PERSON> urged the jury to find Singer guilty of the lesser charge of negligent homicide. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Spafford </PERSON>, said his client only fired his rifle to try to keep an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> team from shooting his wounded brother again. But prosecutor <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON> said Singer and the Swapp brothers had willfully and knowingly prolonged the confrontation and could have accepted a peaceful compromise at any time during the siege.

<TEXT>
 Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> today called on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to reinvigorate itself and be open to unconventional compromises with the opposition. In a speech opening two days of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> debate on the party's role, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> urged top-level personnel changes and said the party is determined to remove `` all remnants of Stalinism'' and embrace `` everything that is consistent with the spirit and realities of the time.'' `` We have to remove this damned wall that separates the party from the young generation,'' he said, speaking unusually bluntly for a party leader. However, he also said the communist <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is and will remain the key political force of socialist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> appeared to confirm that changes in the party leadership were in store. Diplomatic and party sources had said the meeting might result in the replacement of some older Politburo members with younger, vigorous party activists. `` Serious personnel reconstruction of the party leadership'' is needed for the `` great work ahead of us,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. `` The party functioning in a new, effective way will undoubtedly be a more dynamic promoter of ... national agreement. There are no taboo subjects. We are open for brave searchings and unconventional, compromise solutions.'' Earlier, government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> had said the plenum of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was to give `` important impulses in favor of reconciliation'' and help end the deadlock over launching formal talks with the opposition. Plans to hold the talks stalled after Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> demanded that the government clearly signal its willingness to legalize the trade union federation banned in 1982, a year after authorities imposed martial law. Urban told reporters today that `` prospects of the -LRB- talks -RRB- are not bad, since we are noting an improvement in the internal climate.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> formally organized a 128-member citizens committee, whose purpose is to act as a united voice for opposition views on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s social and political problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting brings together top party leaders to debate proposed reforms contained in the 30-page document prepared by the Politburo. `` We are ready to develop dialogue and look for new forms of agreement and cooperation with the opposition,'' the document says, adding the party can cooperate with any opposition group that `` respects the country's constitution and considers its supreme values the good of the nation and state.'' In a negative reference to Solidarity, the document says: `` We will always oppose attempts to use the trade union movement for political manipulations and to transform plants into battlegrounds.'' It appears to rule out the existence of new political parties or legalizing Solidarity, but it takes a generally conciliatory stance toward the opposition. The document endorses public ownership of much of the economy, maintaining <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s alliances within the Soviet bloc and preserving the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s `` leading role.''

 A former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor conspiracy charge stemming from a 1979 gunfight and brawl between Klansmen and black marchers. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who was `` exalted cyclops'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Cullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klavern </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, admitted conspiring with other Klansmen to disrupt the march in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> by blacks, who were protesting the arrest of a black man in the rapes of three white women. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> entered his guilty plea Monday in federal court in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. Prosecutors have not recommended a sentence; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> delayed sentencing until at least late January. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> faces up to one year in prison and a $ 1,000 fine. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> is the third former Klansman to plead guilty in the case. A federal jury convicted a fourth man; five others are scheduled to stand trial Jan. 9 in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. The clash came during one of several protests blacks staged after the arrest of <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, who was charged with raping the three white women in 1978. One march ended in a gunfight and brawl with Klansmen in downtown <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> in which several marchers and policemen were injured. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> was convicted of one of the rape counts and sent to prison. The <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> later ruled that he was mentally incompetent, and he was moved to a mental hospital. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spina </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, said the former Klansman pleaded guilty in part because <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> ruled last month that the conspiracy charge was a misdemeanor rather than a felony. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused last week to review several legal challenges to court rulings the Klan defendants had pursued, clearing the way for the January trial, <PERSON> Spina </PERSON> said.

 A man dressed in a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> suit and brandishing a revolver robbed an armored car of $ 695,000 today, then fled with an accomplice in a <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, police said.

 The federal jury deliberating charges against former <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> asked today to rehear some of the testimony from the prosecution's star witness. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and two others are charged with a divorce-fixing conspiracy. After 12 weeks of testimony, the jury began deliberating Monday and resumed today. In late morning the panel asked to re-hear testimony by <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> as well as the judge's instructions about direct and circumstantial evidence. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, who was Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1945; her lover, one-time city contractor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43; and former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 76, are charged with plotting to cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s temporary support payments to his estranged wife. All three are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and aiding the violation of state bribery laws. `` The gist of conspiracy is agreement,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> explained to jurors Monday during nearly three hours of instructions. It was n't necessary to find any illegal activity `` actually had been carried out'' for a conspiracy conviction, he said, adding that they simply `` must find there was a meeting of the minds of at least two of the defendants.'' Prosecutors contended that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, the city's former cultural affairs commissioner, bribed Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> by giving a $ 19,000-a-year city job to the judge's emotionally troubled and chronically unemployed daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>, 39. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> also faces an obstruction of justice count for an alleged attempt to influence the grand jury testimony of Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. The key witness on that count was Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, who conceded in her testimony that her version of the facts had changed in the past and might change again. She also said that electroshock treatment she underwent for clinical depression left her memory, at times, `` like Swiss cheese.'' None of the defendants testified in their own behalf and <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> told jurors it would be `` unfair, improper and indeed un-American'' to hold that against them. The prosecution's case consisted mainly of circumstantial evidence because there were no witnesses to the alleged bribe scheme. There were, however, two undisputed, facts: <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was hired as Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s personal assistant in late August 1983, and the judge slashed <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s interim support payments from $ 1,850 a week to $ 850 a week on Sept. 14, 1983. The defense contended that Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s hiring may have been unwise but was not illegal. The defense also offered legal and financial explanations for the lowering of <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s support payments. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and $ 513,000 in fines if convicted on all counts. Her two co-defendants face up to 25 years and $ 263,000 in fines. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, once a multimillionaire city sewage contractor, is serving a three-year prison term for income tax evasion.

<HEAD>Governing Party Names Garcia Rival to Key Post</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today named President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s chief rival to its top administrative post, effectively giving the rival control over the party. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was elected secretary-general of the center-left party by a majority of delegates at its 16th <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the party said in a statement. On Saturday, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> offered his resignation as party president after he recieved a bitter reception at the convention. Over the weekend, party leaders indicated they would reject the offer. But no rejection has been issued, and it appeared today that the post of party president would go vacant. Today's vote gives <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who is also the nation's current second vice president, control of the governing party. Analysts said <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> will likely use the power provided by his new post to force <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> to form a new Cabinet composed of mainstream party members. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has been <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s president since July 1985. His resignation from the party role did not affect his position as head of the country, but indicated a serious eroding of his supoport. His party opponents frequently accused him of ignoring the wishes of large sectors of the party in running the country, and his reputation has plummeted in the face of the worst financial crisis to hit <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> this century. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> served as prime minister and finance minister during the first two years of <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s five-year term but resigned in a power struggle stemming over differences with <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> on economic policy, analysts say. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Negreiros </PERSON>, incumbent secretary general and <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> ally, for the post in voting that concluded around dawn today. Since resigning from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has been campaigning for secretary-general, considered a springboard to the party candidacy for the nation's presidency.

 A record 6.83 million Japanese traveled abroad in 1987, taking advantage of the yen's continued strengthening against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, the government said Tuesday. The number was up 23.8 percent from the previous record of 5.52 million in 1986, according to an annual report. `` We believe we'll be able to see 10 million people -LRB- a year -RRB- going abroad within five years,'' said <PERSON> Yasushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Babasaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Research and Planning Division. In 1987, the Japanese government launched a program to double the number of Japanese travelers abroad in a five-year period to help give this nation of 120 million a more international outlook. The number of foreign visitors to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year rose 4.5 percent to 2.16 million, but still was below the 1985 figure of 2.33 million visitors, the paper said. The yen's value against the dollar has nearly doubled since September 1985, making foreign visits cheaper for Japanese and visits to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> more expensive for foreigners.

<TEXT>
 An English professor at <ORGANIZATION> Darthmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who is also a syndicated newspaper columnist testified today that the administration at the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school engaged in a pattern of trying to repress a conservative off-campus student newspaper. Professor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, whose son was among the newspaper's founders in 1980, testified that the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> establishment was antagonized by the Review's espousal of a return to a core curriculum based on the great works of Western civilization `` The counter-culture and New Left people of the 60s and 70s ... are now in positions of power'' and are shifting emphasis at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> and other schools away from the great works in favor of such courses as women's, black and native American studies, he said. The new campus leaders, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` select particular groups as oppressed and lead them toward liberation'' through a `` grievance-generating mechanism.'' Earlier, a <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> lawyer rejected charges that the college tried to stifle the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, and alleged that two former editors who were suspended deliberately provoked a professor in a grab for headlines. `` What you wanted to do is provoke Professor -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- Cole so you would get something newsworthy, right?'' lawyer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> asked former <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> on Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> denied the charge and accused <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> of denying him and colleague <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> a fair disciplinary hearing and unduly punishing them over a classroom encounter with <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> in February. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, seek reinstatement before their suspensions expire in September 1989. Their cause has drawn support from several prominent conservatives, including <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> rebuffed attempts by the students' lawyers to argue that the sanctions will chill free speech on campuses nationwide. `` I do not believe that the testimony along those lines is relevant'' to the reinstatement request, <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> and a third student, who are white, were suspended in March for the encounter with <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who is black. The confrontation came after the paper called one of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s courses `` one of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s most academically deficient'' and denounced him for `` racist rantings.'' The students denied racist intent, but the incident sparked renewed racial unrest at the <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> campus. The third student's suspension has ended; a fourth Review staffer involved in the confrontation served probation The three students and the review also have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> alleging they were targeted for their outspoken conservative views, such as opposing affirmative action and women's studies courses at the school. Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, as well as <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, have supported the students The staffers of the off-campus paper allege that a <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary panel was packed with administrators, teachers and students who disliked the Review and were mindful of college President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s public denunciations of the publication's actions <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> also charged that he and his colleagues were denied due process. `` These students were disciplined and the extent of the discipline was because of their exercise or attempt to exercise freedom of expression ... and the newspaper is suffering as a result,'' Review lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruegger </PERSON> argued. But <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> defended the disciplinary hearing process and said `` there has been no effort whatsoever by <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to stifle the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>.'' The lawyer added that <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> _ who, like <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, is expected to testify in the hearing later this week _ `` has scrupulously acknowledged the right of the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> to express its views.'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> urged the court to respect the private school's internal disciplinary authority He also defended the severity of the punishment as befitting an `` incursion'' into the classroom that he said could be the most severe case of such misconduct ever at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> also dismissed charges that the Review's treatment of Cole was racist. Cole listened quietly in the courtroom gallery. Review staffers said they tried to obtain comment from Cole by telephone on the critical article, but he declined, calling them racist. The staffers said that on advice of the paper's lawyer, they then went to <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s classroom to give him a written statement offering him a chance to respond. The students said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> cursed and threatened them. <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> should have been punished, not the students.

The film will cost between $ 20 million and $ 30 million, and will include a cast of 30,000 to 50,000 extras, including two divisions of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Filming is to begin next fall, with a release date of late 1990, <PERSON> Luu </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps we'll be up for an Oscar in 1990,'' he said. `` The Last Emperor,'' the <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci-directed </PERSON> film of the life of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, the child emperor when the Qing Dynasty crumbled in 1911, won nine Oscars and was one of the most celebrated films about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ever made. <PERSON> Luu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lumina </PERSON>, an independent company making its first major production, began working on the project four years ago, and was not influenced by the success of the <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> film. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side will put up 90 percent of the investment and the Chinese partner will put up 10 percent, he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will receive 10 percent of profits and all earnings from the market in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, director of `` Gandhi,'' has been approached about directing the film, and the main actors will be Americans of Oriental descent, <PERSON> Luu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruolin </PERSON>, vice minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Movie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chin </ORGANIZATION> _ also known as <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> _ `` was a great man in Chinese history.

<HEAD>Report Points To Sewers And Landfills As Source Of Beach Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH EDWARDSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The washed-up medical waste and other debris that spoiled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-area </LOCATION> beaches last summer came from several sources, including a landfill, sewer overflows, garbage transfer stations and storm water outlets, state officials say. `` We have not found any evidence of a single culprit discharging the medical waste,'' Environmental Conservation Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> said as he released a report on an investigation into the waste. Several of the state's most popular beaches had to be closed temporarily during the area's hottest summer in decades when debris _ including syringes and blood vials _ came ashore. Waste washups also resulted in beach closings in other Eastern states, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, as well as along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The report blamed the washups primarily on inadequate garbage handling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and on the weather. Medical waste accounted for only 1 percent to 10 percent of the washed up debris. <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> said Monday the highly publicized beach closings pointed to the need for more stringent controls on all garbage, including medical waste. The report highlights the need for change in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s sewage and landfill systems, said a spokesman for a national environmental organization `` While an army of state, federal and local people have been looking for midnight dumpers, the real villain here may actually be the city sewer system and the city's landfills,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Izeman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. While much of the beach waste probably was disposed of legally, environmental officials still believe the vials of blood that washed ashore could have been the result of illegal dumping, said <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON>. The vials, at least one of which contained blood contaminated by the AIDS virus, are the subject of a criminal investigation, he said. The state and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have strengthened garbage policies and improved facilities since the beach closings, said <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON>.

 Members of a pro-military student group, dressed as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> and two elves, appeared at a White House gate Tuesday to hand out candy canes along with letters asking President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to pardon former national security aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The foursome also visited the offices of several news organizations and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys, and delivered a stocking full of coal to independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who is prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON> for his role in the Iran-contra affair. Their petition from `` Santa'' said that `` Only you, Mr. President, can give <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> the gift that I, and tens of millions of Americans, would like to see him have for Christmas this year _ a full and unconditional pardon.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, has said he does not believe it would be fair to North to pardon him before he has a chance to vindicate himself in court. North's trial is likely to begin in late January, after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has left office. The costumed students were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a campus wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, which supports President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s strategic defense initiative and other Pentagon programs.

 The prosecution in the trial of a former lawyer accused of fatally beating his 6-year-old adopted daughter rested its case today after an expert on child abuse testified that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was a battered child. Besides the medical expert, the prosecution called a neighbor who told jurors she heard sounds of violence coming from the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment the night before the child was found dead. The defense was to begin its case later today in the 9-week-old trial. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with murder in the November 1987 death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, who he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed teen-ager and raised as his own. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was removed unconscious from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s apartment the morning of Nov. 2, and taken to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she died of a head injury three days later. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> denies that he hit the child, but his longtime companion, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, has testified that he told her the night the child was injured that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> died after choking on vegetables and her own vomit. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse. Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> testified today that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was a battered child based on medical, pediatric and autopsy reports and color photographs taken at the hospital and at <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment. She said that multiple bruises, the child's poor hygiene and the brain hemorrhage <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> suffered were consistent with child abuse. Neighbor <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonano </PERSON> testified Monday that she heard slaps and screams from the apartment before the night <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> is accused of beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> to death. Ms. <PERSON> Bonano </PERSON> said she called police three or four times after hearing the sounds from the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment, two floors above her. Ms. <PERSON> Bonano </PERSON> also testified that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> appeared increasingly `` battered'' in the years before the child died, and that by November 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was limping.

<HEAD>Newspapers Jump To Defense of Duchess' Fashion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tabloids, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Daily Mirror and other <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> tabloids have risen to the defense of the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, criticizing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> designer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> for having `` the barefaced cheek'' to put her on his worst-dressed list. The Mirror said Tuesday that <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> was `` so sensitive about his own precious looks that he's had them rearranged four times.'' <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> had hit out at the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> in a preview of his list of the world's 10 worst-dressed women, saying she has none of the style of her sister-in-law Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, that she looks `` as if she makes beds in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> or milks cows,'' and that she `` walks like a duck with a bad leg.'' Until recently, the tabloids have not been great fans of the duchess' wardrobe, saying it runs to frumpy, outrageous and ill-fitting. But the 29-year-old commoner, who married Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> in 1986, has worked hard to retrieve her svelte figure following the birth of their daughter, Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, and her stylish, well-cut new wardrobe has won plaudits from the tabloids. For the popular press, which has a near-obsession with royal watching and prints the minutest pieces of trivia, the attack on the duchess was over the top, and below-the-belt ripostes about facelifts were only to be expected. `` What A Jerk,'' bannered the Sun, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest selling daily, on Monday. It quoted American model <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Helvin </PERSON> as saying nobody `` takes a blind bit of notice'' of <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amies </PERSON>, a favorite designer of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was quoted as calling him `` a complete ignoramus.'' The rival <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, under the headline `` He's At It Again!,'' accused <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> of `` talking through his hat.'' The Daily Mirror noted that <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>'s attack came `` just as the new, slim-line <PERSON> Fergie </PERSON> is winning over fashion critics here ... in well-cut outfits which suit her figure.'' The newspaper Today said the duchess' new look had come `` just too late to spare her another blasting'' from <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>. A Mirror cartoon showed <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> strung up to a Christmas tree, the duchess standing on the floor dressed as a milkmaid, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> saying: `` Now then, Mr. <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, what was it you said about my wife?''

<TEXT>
 A newspaper executive's stepson was found guilty today of attempted, willful, premeditated, first-degree murder by a jury that also found he inflicted great bodily harm on the girlfriend he tried to kill. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, 24, sat stone still as the jury's verdict was announced in a packed courtroom. His stepfather, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridder </PERSON>, sat in a front row of the courtroom and remained grim-faced as the jury read the verdict. The jury, which reached its decision late Monday and kept it sealed overnight, issued three separate verdicts _ one finding <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> guilty of attempted murder, the second finding that he used a firearm illegally and the third saying he intentionally inflicted great bodily injury. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of life in prison with the possibility for parole. Neither the victim, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>, nor her family was in court when the verdict was read. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> pleaded innocent to attempted first-degree murder, saying he was in a Valium-induced stupor June 8 when he shot Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> with a single bullet to the back, paralyzing her below the waist. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, who had taken more than 20 pills, then shot himself in the chest, inflicting a wound from which he later recovered. Prosecutors alleged that <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, stepson of the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Press-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, fabricated the blackout defense to avoid taking responsibility for shooting Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>, 23, in her parents' home. The defense urged the jury to return a verdict, at most, of assault with a deadly weapon, which carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> as a selfish, irresponsible man who fired the .38 - caliber revolver with too much precision to be suffering from a drug-induced But defense attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s actions on the diazepam that he purportedly took to kill himself. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> was in a state of depression partly caused by a $ 30,000 gambling debt and his failure to fulfill his early promise as a tennis player. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> testified that on the night of the shootings he only remembered going to Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>'s home and laying out the contents of his wallet on a bed. He said he did n't remember bringing the gun. Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>, who attended the trial in her wheelchair, testified that she awoke as the bullet pierced her spine, then dragged herself to the telephone to call for help.

 Farmers have contracted with the government to take an additional 2.6 million acres of highly erodible cropland from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON>, an official of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the last contracts were accepted from more than 3.4 million acres offered during the program's seventh signup period held July 18 through Aug. 31. The total now under <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION>, as the program is called, is more than 28.2 million acres. <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON> said the eighth signup for the program has been scheduled for Feb. 6-24. Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers who are accepted get annual rental payments from the government and one-time assistance to pay for half the cost of planting trees, shrubs and grass to guard against erosion. <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON> said the bids accepted for annual payments in the latest round averaged $ 49.71 per acre. The average for the first six signups was $ 48.38 per acre, he said.

 A federal grand jury indicted a chemist and six other people in the distribution of the synthetic narcotic <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION>, which has been blamed for 13 deaths in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON>, 48, of suburban <PERSON> Aspinwall </PERSON> was charged in the 33-count indictment handed up Monday of manufacturing 3-methylfentanyl in his basement and distributing it to two men who died of overdoses in May and July. Schaefers is accused of producing the drug in several batches from late 1987 to September or October of this year. After police raided his house Dec. 1, they determined that about six ounces of the drug, which is similar to heroin, had reached the street, mostly in October and November. Police believe as much as an additional 24 ounces of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White from the batches _ enough for thousands of individual doses _ remains unaccounted for. Schaefers, who was arrested when his house was raided, is being held on bond. The other six were indicted on distribution charges. Federal narcotics law provides a mandatory minimum 20-year prison term and a maximum of life in prison for those convicted of producing or distributing a controlled substance that causes a death.

 City transit officials have decided the best solution to employees who pocket fare money is to get rid of the pockets. `` Opportunity makes the thief,'' said <PERSON> Gordana </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> board. She endorsed a plan Monday to immediately distribute pocketless uniforms to all workers who handle bus fares. Money counters for the regional public bus system handle about $ 130 million in cash per year, and officials hope that overalls without pockets and other security measures will put the brakes on fare box thievery. An audit completed in May showed the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> could be losing millions of dollars each year to casual pilferage or organized theft. `` In the counting rooms, workers have had uniforms without pockets for years,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibilsky </PERSON>, a Transit District spokesman. `` The personnel who are going to be getting uniforms are the maintenance people who handle the vaults.''

 AIDS in a few years is likely to become the fifth leading killer of Americans from birth to age 24 if present trends continue, say federal health officials. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report says President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Domestic Policy Council got in the way of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials' attempts at launching an anti-AIDS education program in the spring of 1987. The report is also critical of television networks for declining to run many anti-AIDS public service spots when they did become available, particularly those dealing with condoms as a way to prevent spread of the deadly virus. The report, issued last week, said further that ther were problems with getting a national AIDS hotline operating at full speed, although it said those lapses had been mostly corrected by last summer. Meanwhile, Dr. <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> on Monday that AIDS is already the ninth leading cause of death among children 1 to 4 years old and the seventh leading cause of deaths among young people age 15 to 24. If present trends continue, she said, the disease soon will move up to No. 5. The five leading causes of death among people age 15 to 24 in 1985, the last year for which figures are available, were accidents, suicide, homicide, cancer and heart disease. For people age 5 to 14, the top five in 1985 were accidents, cancer, birth defects, homicide and heart disease. For children from 1 to 4, the top four were accidents, birth defects, cancer, and heart disease. For infants under 1, the leading causes were complications at birth, birth defects, `` ill-defined conditions,'' accidents and pneumonia and flu. As of Dec. 12, 1,291 cases of AIDS had been reported among infants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the 13-to-19-year group. Of those, 717 who were under 13 at the time of their diagnosis have already died, along with 174 who were adolescents when diagnosed. `` The official figures include only those children whose condition was reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a report from a task force headed by <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>. `` Probably for every child who meets the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> definition of AIDS, another two to 10 are infected with HIV. It is estimated that by 1991 there will be at least 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and health officials are growing increasingly concerned that a large majority of those infected eventually will develop AIDS and die. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, requested by Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., said that even though the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS education budget increased from about $ 17 million in fiscal 1985 to nearly $ 210 million in 1988, `` its efforts to focus national attention on AIDS prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key activities aimed at the general public. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> decided in May 1987 to designate the following October as `` AIDS Awareness and Prevention Month,'' but was unable to get clearance from the White House Domestic Policy Council _ a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> group _ for its plans to conduct a national AIDS information mailing to all households. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had made clear it thought such a mailing should be done, but had not explicitly required it. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made a mailing mandatory the following year and the pamphlet `` Understanding AIDS'' went out to more than 100 million households last June. In conjunction with `` AIDS Awareness and Prevention Month'' in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> contracted for production of 38 public service announcements on AIDS and distributed them to the major television networks on Sept. 30, 1987, the report said. However, it said there was only one airing by a network during the following month and only six the following months. When ads did air, they were not likely to be seen by many people. Between December 1987 and February 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reported, nearly 90 percent of all network-aired AIDS public service announcements were shown during non-primetime viewing hours. Nearly 60 percent were shown between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>GNP Rises Moderately, But Fed Still Expected To Hike Interest Rates</HEAD>

 The economy expanded at a moderate 2.5 percent pace during the July-September quarter, the government reported Tuesday, but analysts said growth was rebounding and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> probably will nudge interest rates higher as a result. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said growth of the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed during the third quarter from 3.0 percent in the 2nd quarter and 3.4 percent in the first three months of the year. The GNP, after adjusting for inflation, rose $ 24.2 billion to an annual rate of $ 4.01 trillion in the third quarter. The GNP figure for the third quarter, the slowest expansion pace since the final quarter of 1986, was a slight downward revision from a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent issued a month ago. Most economists had been looking for a slight upward adjustment. The trend should be good news for <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy makers who want to curb economic growth to a range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent, which they believe is sustainable without increasing inflation. However, the government said the temporary effects of the summer drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures, are masking the true strength of the economy in the final nine months of the year. Drought losses of $ 12.3 billion reduced the GNP growth rate by 0.9 percentage points in the second quarter, 0.5 percentage points in the third and will knock more than 1.0 percent off of fourth quarter rate. The growth rate in the final three months of this year, excluding the effects of the drought, will top 3 percent, most economists believe. In the first half of next year, assuming a return to normal farm production, the economy will be expanding at a rate between 3 percent and 4 percent, they say. `` What you're left with is an economy that is growing too fast to be acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> members fear that a GNP growth rate higher than the target range will strain factory capacity, leading to shortages and resulting price increases. Also, by boosting employment, the growth encourages employers to bid up wages. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s `` cure'' is higher interest rates designed to make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to spend. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began nudging interest rates higher in late March, capping a series of tightening moves in August with a rise in the discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to member banks. When economic statistics for October and November made it clear that growth remained robust, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> responded last week by bumping up the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 8 | percent to 8 ~ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the next tightening move likely will come in the first two weeks of next month, with another quarter point rise in the federal funds rate. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will have to lean somewhat against those -LRB- strong growth -RRB- winds with a series of modest tightening steps,'' but it will delay raising the discount rate. `` If anything, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is in danger of underreacting.'' However, other economists, noting that consumer prices are rising at a 4.4 percent annual rate in 1988, the same as last year, say inflation fears are overstated. `` What we're afraid of is the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will get carried away next year and raise interest rates too high and keep them too high too long,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` We might end up with a recession in late 1989 or early 1990.'' But <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> noted that a GNP price index, which measures price increases in what Americans are producing as opposed to what they are buying, shot up at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the third quarter, the biggest jump in six years. That was up from a 5.0 percent rate in the second quarter. In an accompanying report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said corporate profits after taxes advanced 3.9 percent in the third quarter after soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. An earlier estimate, which did not take into account profits by overseas subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, had said third quarter profits rose only a slight 0.2 percent.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was declared winner Tuesday of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s presidential election, and he appealed for an end to the killing that has crippled this tropical island nation. `` The ballots of the people have triumphed over the bullets of brutality,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said. `` The politics of terror has no place in the temple of democracy,'' he said. `` I will eradicate fear and suppression. I will restore law and order.'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s victory with slightly more than half of the votes ended a campaign marked by hundreds of slayings, which the government blames on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese extremist group that opposed the balloting. Police said members of the group hacked and shot to death nine supporters of <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s party Tuesday in <LOCATION> Bandarawela </LOCATION>, 76 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. A 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was imposed on the nation of 16 million to prevent violence after the results were announced. `` I have an appeal to make to those who have still to join the democratic process,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said in a nationally televised address. `` Your participation will enable us to eradicate fear and poverty with greater speed.'' He also stretched a conciliatory hand to the two losing candidates, although an adviser to the runner-up, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, said she was not accepting the final results. The intimidation campaign by the Sinhalese extremists kept many people from the polls Monday. Only 55 percent of 9.3 million eligible voters turned out to vote compared with 80 percent in the last presidential election six years ago. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> received 50.4 percent of the vote, followed by Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 44.9 percent, according to election Commissioner <PERSON> Chandrananda </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. He said no balloting took place in parts of eastern <LOCATION> Moneragala </LOCATION> district because no polling officers had arrived, but he added that the three candidates agreed not to make an issue out of it. Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> had no immediate comment. But <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponnambalam </PERSON>, a spokesman for the five-party <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>' Alliance that backed her, said the candidate sent a letter to the Elections Commissioner `` requesting him not to announce results since she is not accepting the final count. When <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> takes over <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s most powerful government post Jan. 2, he will be working with a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which was dissolved Tuesday by outgoing President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> has ruled for 11 years and was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for Feb. 15. The president serves for six years and appoints the prime minister and other ministers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said `` we look forward to working closely with President-elect <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> to strengthen further the warm relationship we have enjoyed with <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>.'' `` The people and the leadership of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> have displayed laudable courage and determination in holding presidential elections in defiance of terrorist threats,'' the department said in a brief statement. The current cycle of violence in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, an island once famed as an idyllic tourist resort, dates from 1983, when the Tamil ethnic minority began its uprising against the majority <PERSON> Sinalhese </PERSON>. Nearly 10,000 people have been killed since then. With the help of neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the subcontinent's superpower and home to 60 million Tamils, <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed a peace accord in July 1987 aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> opposed the plan despite being a top government official and boycotted the signing ceremony. The pact guaranteed some autonomy to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, and invited <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to help end the uprising by sending troops, which now total 47,000. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> vehemently opposes the pact, saying the government should not compromise with the Tamils. The <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> rebels seeking an independent state also oppose the accord, and are fighting Indian soldiers in the northeast. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has called for the phased or immediate withdrawal of Indian troops, but dealing with the huge neighbor could prove difficult. Indian High Commissioner J.N. <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> has indicated his country wo n't accept unilateral action. `` The peace pact was a bilateral one and the unilateral abrogation by one side will create an unprecedented situation,'' he said recently. `` As far as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is concerned, we are firmly committed to the accord.'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> also stressed his determination to fight poverty in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where the annual per capital income is $ 360. He has proposed giving $ 75 a month to the poorest families, but has not explained how to pay for the program.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> today blamed improperly loaded cargo for the crash of a commuter plane in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> last year that killed 18 people. The board said the <ORGANIZATION> Ryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> flight crew failed to properly oversee the loading of the craft and that so much of the cargo was loaded in the rear that the pilot lost control of the plane. `` The real responsibility rested with the crew, which is responsible for supervising the loading of the aircraft,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. `` For reasons I guess we'll never know, they failed in that function.'' The twin-engine turboprop crashed on approach to Homer Airport in Homer, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, on Nov. 23, 1987. Eighteen of the 21 people on board were killed. Investigators had believed that ice on the aircraft might have contributed to the accident, but the board said the ice `` did not cause but may have exacerbated the loss of control.'' The crash was <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON>'s 10th in eight years, and the company had been fined 10 months before the crash for record-keeping violations. While the board did not explicitly clear <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> for any blame in the accident, it adopted no conclusions that the commuter airline was at fault. The staff report was adopted on a 4-1 vote, with board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> voting no because he first wanted to see changes in wording that were agreed to in the board's meeting.

 The tale of a priest who was forced to sell two prized lithographs to pay overdue bills at his jobs center generated sympathy and money, but questions have arisen about the man's past. One potential donor said he canceled plans to raise at least $ 10,000 for the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glassport </LOCATION>. And the bank handling contributions, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glassport </LOCATION>, decided to close the account Tuesday because of skepticism about DaeCheck, said manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Katona </PERSON>. <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> opened the account Monday with $ 500. <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> acknowledged he has had some brushes with authorities, including an investigation by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regarding a publishing company he owned that filed for bankruptcy. But Glassport Police Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihoces </PERSON> defends DaeCheck. `` What he has done outside is n't important,'' the chief said. `` He does help people.'' Some of the center's clients, workers displaced by the decline of the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s steel industry, said last week that <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> had helped them obtain retraining and submit resumes. <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> said he founded the non-profit jobs center seven months ago in part to make up for past mistakes and has only the center's welfare at heart `` We've been here for seven months doing good work. Hopefully I'll be here another seven months doing good work or until it's needed,'' he said To get money for the center's phone bill, DaeCheck last week sold two 19th-century French lithographs, one a Daumier, for $ 500 to a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> businessman, who also donated an additional $ 800 to the center. Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> agreed to continue phone service because of assurances the bill of more than $ 300 would be paid. DaeCheck's advertisements offering the bargain-priced lithos attracted attention, and he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week that he was pastor of an independent Russian Orthodox Church called St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. He said the jobs center was a mission of the church. But after questions arose, <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> said he does not have a congregation or conduct services. He explained Monday that <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is actually <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> All-Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, founded by the Revs. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Harringtons </ORGANIZATION> said they ordained DaeCheck and hundreds of people based on the applicant's knowledge of the Bible and belief in God. <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> said he briefly attended but did not graduate from Savanarolo Theological Seminary in <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> also said he was ordained in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in 1981 by Bishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. That church, he said, was based in <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and is distinct from the bettern-known <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But the rector of the Savanarolo seminary, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzostowski </PERSON>, said Monday he had no records of DaeCheck's attendance. <PERSON> Brzostowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyrill </PERSON> of the western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> diocese of the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said they never heard of <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Directory assistance in <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, also had no listing for the church or <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is n't around ... there's not much I can do for you,'' <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> said. `` My orders come from the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> started the publishing company in 1974. He said he went out of business in 1982 after publishing about 150 books on a cooperative basis with the authors. `` A lot of people are probably very bitter that I went bankrupt,'' he said. `` I went through a terrible time.'' <PERSON> Caren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON>, deputy state attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> failed to publish manuscripts, make refunds on time or register the business with the state. In June 1985, <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> agreed to reimburse seven authors a total of $ 5,354. The postal service investigated <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON> but never charged him with any crime, said Postal Inspector <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutzman </PERSON>. <PERSON> DaeCheck </PERSON>'s background was enough to make <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, owner of Allied Security of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, cancel plans to organize business people interested in giving $ 10,000 to the center. `` I think I'm going to back off,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said Monday.

The strike call for Dec. 24 and Jan. 6 follows a dispute between authorities and local <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> officials over whether Christmas celebrations would be held this year in the biblical city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> during the Arab uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. The army, meanwhile, reported it demolished three houses and sealed a fourth Tuesday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, saying the houses belonged to members of a gang who attacked an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian and a policeman. Three Palestinians were wounded during clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital sources said. The call for general strikes was issued in a leaflet distributed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and signed by the PLO-backed leaders of the yearlong Palestinian uprising. The leaflet called for strikes `` as a rejection of the occupation and a rejection of any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> participation in the Christmas celebration.'' It urged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stores, which have been open only from 9 a.m. to noon during much of the uprising, to remain open all day on Dec. 23 and Jan. 5 `` so our Christian brothers can buy what they need.'' Distribution of the leaflet came as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials disputed statements by <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> that Christmas celebrations would be curtailed this year because of the `` intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising. Israeli tourism officials put out statements saying that the usual choir concert would be held in <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, adjacent to the Church of the Nativity, which contains the grotto where <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was born. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers put up decorative Christmas lights and a sign saying `` Merry Xmas and Happy New Year'' on the road to <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and were constructing a stage for the concert in Manger Square. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, a Christian Palestinian, had announced that no lighted Christmas tree would be displayed in the square this year and boy scouts would not take part in the traditional parade with church leaders. He said this was because many <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents did not feel like celebrating after the yearlong uprising in which more than 330 Palestinians have been killed, nine of them from the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> area. Thirteen Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, once a small town populated mostly by Palestinian Christians, now has a population of about 35,000, many of them Moslems displaced by the founding of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1948. The leaflet also called for two other general strikes in late December and early January. It praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for announcing last week it would open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move `` a victory for the intefadeh.'' The leaflet also urged carrying on with the uprising `` as a national duty.'' `` We must double our efforts ... so we can strike against the occupation army,'' it said. An army announcement Tuesday said soldiers demolished three houses and sealed one in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and the nearby village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Qad </LOCATION> after uncovering a gang of 14 members who carried out attacks on Israelis. The houses belonged to four members of the gang who played a major role in violence, which included the stabbing of an Israeli civilian and an attack on a policeman, the army said. An army spokesman said he did not know if all the members of the gang had been arrested or if any of them had been charged with crimes or tried. Israeli troops also raided at least four villages in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, forcing residents to paint over anti-Israeli graffiti, destroying olive groves and conducting searches for suspects, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. An army spokesman said troops carried out some raids on Palestinian villages Tuesday, but he could not give the number or exact location. He said no arrests were made. The spokesman confirmed a youth was shot by troops who fired on stone-throwers in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. He said he was checking the reports of other injuries. Hospital officials said a 15-year-old was suffered a bullet wound in the buttocks in a clash with soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arik </ORGANIZATION> and another youth was shot in the Shati refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The clash in <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arik </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, erupted after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops brought in bulldozers to destroy groves of olive and lemon trees that youths used as cover to throw stones at passing Israeli buses, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said.

 Christmas should be a hopping good time for Quasimodo, who'll make the leap from pet store prodigy to house pet for some lucky youngster. The rare red-eyed, albino bullfrog has lived at <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s shop for 18 months, greeting customers and entertaining hundreds of children. But this Christmas, Quasimodo is being adopted for the princely price of $ 59.97. At first, viewers may mistake Quasimodo for a plastic toy, because of his out-of-the-ordinary yellow color and his practice of sitting motionless for long periods. But underneath, he's all frog. Quasimodo's unusual color is due to a lack of sufficient pigmentation to make him the run-of-the-mill-pond brownish green. He was a highly unusual find for <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, who bought Quasimodo from a wholesale dealer. `` It was unusual that he was found before he was eaten,'' he said. `` Most albino frogs stand out so much they are gobbled up by other predators. Somehow he survived long enough to get captured.'' The nearly 2-year-old frog is still growing, and in the security of his new family, he can be expected to live eight to 10 years, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said.

 Iron is discoloring the water in <LOCATION> Waterford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, and hairdressers say they're not the only ones who know for sure. Residents of the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community who shampoo with the rusty public water supply complain that it's turning their hair yellow, orange and even green, an undesireable shade even in this holiday season. `` What -LRB- the iron -RRB- is doing is depositing on blond hair or any type of hair and it builds up,'' said beauty salon owner <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` I've had cases where the hair turns green.'' Some of the township's public wells contain iron levels six times higher than <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> guidelines, state and county officials said. The iron does n't pose any known health threats, but it makes the water taste bitter, smell bad, stain laundry and clog pipes. The township could end the problem by tying into <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s water network, according to a report issued last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Waterford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 The failures of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program over the past 30 years are highlighted in an unusual exhibit. The exhibit at the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cosmosphere </LOCATION> and Space Center features the remains of the Mercury-Atlas I, the ill-fated, unmanned rocket that exploded less than one minute after liftoff on July 29, 1960. The remains were retrieved from the floor of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> more than 20 years ago and previously were housed in a museum in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The exhibit, which opened Monday, also includes a backup unit for <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the Soviet Sputnik. <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>, launched Dec. 6, 1957, rose six inches and collapsed. But the display is not only about failures. `` This shows the difficulties we faced in getting man, and rockets, into space,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Ary </PERSON>, executive director of the space museum. There is a wall-sized mural of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. An old RCA television sitting in a recreation of a 30-year-old livingroom plays <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which he proposed the Apollo moon-landing program. `` I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before the decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. A brief video called `` 39 Percent Success Rate'' provides a light look at some of the 80 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unmanned satellite launches, 49 of which ended in failure. A block house blast window _ a 250-pound chunk of glass that shielded the launch crew at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> _ sits in the middle of the exhibit.

 A pirate rock' n' roll ship operating off the coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ca n't continue broadcasting without a license from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a judge has ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNaught </PERSON> issued a summary judgment Dec. 13 against <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, former owner of the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> and one of four defendants, who contended the radio ship had a constitutional right to broadcast without an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> license on `` open and unused frequencies.'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer, had argued that the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was a foreign-registered ship in international waters and did n't come under the scope of the FCC. He also maintained that since the station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, was broadcasting on an unassigned AM frequency, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> was violating First Amendment rights to free speech. <PERSON> McNaught </PERSON> rejected those arguments, noting that the government said numerous stations could be subject to interference if the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> broadcast. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> has said he launched the pirate station to protest what he called conformity in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> radio programming. The <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> has broadcast only twice. In July 1987, it broadcast of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, for about four days and then agents of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boarded the ship and stopped broadcasts. The <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was towed to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> promised a federal court in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> he would cease operations. `` Everybody in the project is absolutely frustrated,'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We could go on the air and not harm or create one single problem. It's just that we've got a hysterical FCC.'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> maintained that the <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> is an international ship because it is registered in <ORGANIZATION> Sealand </ORGANIZATION>, a self-proclaimed principality in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the coast of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. Prosecutors argued that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not recognize <ORGANIZATION> Sealand </ORGANIZATION> and recently extended its territorial limit to include the unofficial country. The judge said the defendants `` could not look to the First Amendment for authority to broadcast on an unoccupied frequency in violation of both federal and international law. The First Amendment does not grant anyone the right to broadcast by radio.''

 The inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, billed as the most open inaugural celebration ever, is now open to contributors who want to give less than $ 100,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has dropped a $ 100,000 minimum requirement covering private donations for inaugural activities ranging from galas to children's festivals. `` The committee simply never anticipated the number of people or corporations that would want to participate ... at various levels. We've been overwhelmed,'' said committee spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>. Organizers of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inaugural have said it will have more free events and include more of the public than any previous inauguration, reflecting the wishes and style of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family. Time pressure prompted the initial decision to limit donations to $ 100,000 or more, <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> said. He said accepting smaller amounts would have been too complex from an administrative standpoint. At this stage, he said, `` preparations are well under way and initial financing has been secured; our goal is to enable as many other individuals and corporations to participate as possible.'' The $ 100,000 minimum on private contributions had been criticized as giving wealthy corporations a way to curry favor with the incoming administration. The private donations are not tax-deductible. There is no disclosure requirement for private donations, and inaugural officials have said they do not plan to release detailed lists of contributors. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> declined to say how many corporations and individuals were seeking to contribute less than $ 100,000 or what the lowest offer had been. Contributions must be linked to specific inaugural activities and events. In a related matter, <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> said the committee has reached its goal of $ 20 million in guaranteed loans. Two hundred corporations and individuals have put up $ 100,000 apiece under that program, which is designed to secure up-front operating money for the committee. The interest-free loans will be repaid after the inauguration from private donations and proceeds from the sale of souvenirs and tickets to balls, dinners and other activities.

He said the fire was contained by a system that pumped carbon dioxide into the engine rooms to starve the flames of oxygen.

 The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday ruled it has the authority to deal with a Nicaraguan complaint that neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is supporting rebels fighting <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government The ruling was the latest step in a dispute between the two Central American nations that has been before the court since 1986. A final decision is not expected before 1990. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is actively supporting the Contra insurgents and is seeking a court-ordered halt to the alleged assistance. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, however, has been contending the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has no jurisdiction in the case. It says it limited its acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction one month before <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> filed the complaint in July 1986. The Sandinista complaint came one month after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> won a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> condemnation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration support for the Contras. Tuesday's ruling means the court, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, can examine the merits of the Nicaragua-Honduran dispute. The 15-judge forum is the judicial arm of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

 CBS got a `` A Very Brady Christmas'' gift when the reunion movie featuring the 1970s sitcom family was No. 2 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> television ratings, giving <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> its first week out of third place this season. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> firmly won the week anyway, and `` The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1 show last week. As of Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was still in third place in the Nielsens, but Sunday's `` A Very Brady Christmas'' was the highest-rated made-for-TV movie so far this season, with a rating of 25.1 and a 39 share, and boosted <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> into second place. The sitcom `` The Brady Bunch'' ran on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> from 1969-1974 and has a cult following in reruns. `` The Cosby Show'' had a rating of 25.9 and a 42 share. The rest of the top 10 were: `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, tied with `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS. Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week ending Dec. 18 with an average prime-time rating of 15.4. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 13.1 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> an 11.8. `` ABC World News Tonight'' was the top-rated news show last week, with an average rating of 11.0 and a 20 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 20, edging the `` CBS Evening News,'' which had a 10.7 and 19.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its 17-member staff in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday after the workers received death threats. The Swiss delegates left Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for the Christian eastern sector, then boarded a ferry for <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said police in the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They will fly to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the all-Swiss organization said it had suspended its humanitarian operations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after hearing Monday `` that serious threats had been made against its delegates on mission in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, placing their lives in acute danger.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> therefore feels compelled to suspend its entire humanitarian operation there and to repatriate all its expatriate staff immediately,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Tuesday's action by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> marked the first time in the more than 100-year history of the organization that delegates were withdrawn because of threats on their lives. A committee spokesman, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauverd </PERSON>, declined to say how the death threats were received and what group was believed behind them. The decision came four days after kidnappers released the chief <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, who was held hostage for nearly a month. The kidnapping Nov. 16 prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to scale down its presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after 20 years of operations in the strife-torn country. Ten of the organization's 27 delegates left, but 17 remained. Upon <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s release, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said the staff would soon be increased again and regular activities resumed. The communique said the committee was ready to resume its operations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as soon as the threats `` are clearly and unequivocally withdrawn.'' A rumor circulated in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that the threats had been phoned to the Swedish ambassador in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauffin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gauffin </PERSON> was an intermediary in the contacts that preceded <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s release. In those contacts, his kidnappers identified themselves as members of a group called the `` Organization of Socialist Revolution.'' Swiss authorities said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s captors tried to tie his release to a lenient sentence for a Shiite Lebanese hijacker, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, who is to go on trial at the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Feb. 20. Swiss Foreign Minuister <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> had refused any concessions. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> hijacked an Air Afrique jetliner to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> July 14, 1987 and killed a French passenger before he was overpowered and arrested. He faces up to life imprisonment. The Swiss made up the largest Western community remaining in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after waves of kidnappings, assassinations and civil war violence forced tens of thousands of foreigners to flee <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the last 13 years. Police said the new exodus left less than 24 Westerners living in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Fifteen foreign hostages are now being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They include nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegates operate in about 80 countries worldwide, visiting prisoners and detainees and providing food and medical relief to civilian victims of armed conflict. Their work is primarily based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the protection of prisoners and civilians in time of war.

The postal workers contributed $ 375 for its upkeep. A grocery store chipped in for Christmas dinner. And there were presents for <PERSON> John </PERSON> too. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> said: `` The wheelchair is the best of all.'' After the 1981 accident, Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> was left with herniated discs in her lower back. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who attends a public school for disabled children, was partially brain damaged and still suffers seizures and memory lapses. He also suffers from juvenile arthritis. `` He's been through a lot,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> said. `` My husband left me in 1984 and we stayed at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for three weeks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They gave us a bus ticket out here. But by the time we got here we had only $ 2 to our name. All we had to eat was cereal for the first month.'' Because Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> could afford no presents on her disability pension check this year, <PERSON> John </PERSON> wrapped several empty boxes and put them under the family's Christmas tree. Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> said her son has always been selfless. `` We went to the mall the other day with a friend. -LRB- I -RRB- gave <PERSON> John </PERSON> $ 10 to buy something for himself. He went into a store and came out with a pair of earrings for me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> said. `` When I asked him why he did n't buy a toy for himself, he said, ` You told me I could do anything I want with the money.''' `` It's been hard for him to believe in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> said. `` But I keep telling him he has to believe.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> said he did not expect an answer to his letter. `` I thought I was the last person who would get something from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been shaken by internal turmoil in recent months, raising concerns about the powerful pro-Israeli lobby's relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its ability to protect the Jewish state from the fallout of strained relations with the administration. The latest setback to befall <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> is last week's resignation of its legislative director, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON>, the organization's respected and popular liaison with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> It follows several unfavorable news reports about the generally low-profile group, based partly on documents supplied by disgruntled <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> employees. Included among the allegations were that <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> violated its mandate by supporting candidates in the recent congressional elections and that it mapped out a campaign to smear the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Observers and insiders differ on whether <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s problems are a result of personality clashes or a reflection of fundamental policy differences within the organization, which is viewed as possessing almost mythical clout in this power-conscious city. But all agree it could not have come at a worse time for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the American Jewish community. The paternalistic alliance between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is being strained by last week's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to launch talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The decision, taken after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> declared he recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, is viewed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leadership as betraying a promise given 13 years ago not to deal with its arch-enemy. U.S.-Israel ties will be put to a further test in the months ahead by requests from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for millions of dollars worth of arms sales. There are indications the administration of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be more inclined to acquiesce to those requests, which were turned down under congressional pressure in recent years. Jewish leaders also are concerned that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ancestry, may be less committed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and especially in comparison with outgoing Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` It's now more important than ever that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remain committed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who works closely with <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> and strongly supports the $ 3 billion annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> and others in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who work closely with <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> say they perceive a shift from the organization's emphasis on lobbying the legislative branch to lobbying the executive branch. Others charge <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership, especially Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, with a pro-Republican bias that damns them in the eyes of the Democratic majority on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` The partisanship that is perceived as creeping into <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision-making will hurt them in the long run,'' said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, who has been instrumental in opposing arms sales to the Arabs `` They have to understand that the real bedrock of support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Administrations come and go. We're pretty constant and reliable,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The perception of <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s partisan leanings appears due in part to an eight-year Republican administration which has been warmly supportive of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. For example, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders say they were reluctant to criticize <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s decision to reverse the ban on talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because of his traditionally staunch support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The perception is further highlighted because it contrasts sharply with American Jews' traditional support for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Jews voted 2-to-1 in favor of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the November elections. Especially disturbing to <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was its reaction to the administration's request last summer for 40 F-18 jet fighters worth $ 1.8 billion for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>, following <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s lead, contended that the sale to the moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nation did not threaten <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who led the fight against the sale and counted on <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s backing, was angry `` They lost sight of the fact that in the long run this will be harmful to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There's a legitimate debate about whether we're selling weapons to the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> as a bribe or whether we have a coherent policy toward them. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Amitay </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer who was <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director from 1974 to 1980, cautioned the lobby's leadership about bypassing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and trying to influence the administration directly. `` It's not very sophisticated of them,'' he said. `` Anyone who knows how this city works knows it's wrong.'' <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> leaders declined to be interviewed, saying the organization's low profile is essential for its behind-the-scenes effectiveness. But privately officials said the organization was n't moving away from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, noting that it is adding one congressional lobbyist to its list of five. They also denied any Republican leanings, noting that some of their senior board members are known Democrats.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> became the fifth Democrat to enter the race for national party chairman on Tuesday, saying he represents none of the party's factions and could unify it for the 1992 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, entered the race acknowledging he trails some of the other candidates. `` I believe I can revitalize the party structure and bring all Democrats under the same roof,'' he said at a news conference. `` I am uniquely qualified to do this because I am not the candidate of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or the candidate of the Northeast, or the candidate of the right or the left.'' The nearly 400 voting members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will select a new national chairman when they meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Feb. 9-10. Already in the race are <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former aide to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state party chairman; former Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and former Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> has the backing of former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> does not have a vote on the committee. He is backed by his state's two Democratic senators, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, but his <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> party leaders have endorsed <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> said he expected to compete with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for organized labor's votes on the committee, and he called <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> `` obviously the insider'' in the race. He said he would concentrate on party building and fund raising as chairman. He dismissed <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' proposals for building a permanent staff of campaign professionals to be folded into the eventual presidential nominee's campaign, and said he had no plans for changing delegate selection rules. `` There are many people who want to tinker with the machinery of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. I'm not one of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> is a former <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> city council president who served three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before losing the 1976 Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary to <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Princess Beatrice Gives Short Cry At Baptism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> was bapitized Tuesday by the archbishop of York with water from the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and she let out just one quick cry as her parents, the <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, watched in delight. The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made her a member of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about 100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION>' Palace after the christening to pose briefly for photographers The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked directly into the cameras. She did n't let out a peep as she rested in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band. Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, fifth in line to the throne and the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on Aug. 8, 1988, at 8:18 p.m., considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers. Poet Laureate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the `` blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of `` poisoned glut'' and `` poisoned seas.'' The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of duty in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and second-ranking prelate in the church rather than Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of `` personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York title. The Chapel Royal, the main surviving part of the Tudor Palace built by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said. Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> were married in the chapel in 1840 and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there. The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the parents, `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, Good Above All Other,'' `` All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, `` Away In A Manger.'' The choir also sang `` Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s Anthem,'' composed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Popplewell </PERSON>, organist and choir master of the queen's <ORGANIZATION> Chapels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, with words by the late Lord <PERSON> Gorell </PERSON>, a literary magazine editor. <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of flowing cream <LOCATION> Honiton </LOCATION> lace, first worn by Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s eldest son in 1842. She was baptized at the silver gilt Lily Font, made for the christening in 1840 of Princess <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s eldest child, and used to baptize <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s four children. Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s five were reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil and to follow Christ. Her godparents are <PERSON> Viscount </PERSON> <PERSON> Linley </PERSON>, son of the queen's sister Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>; property developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>; Mrs. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotterell </PERSON>, who formerly shared an apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of <LOCATION> Roxburghe </LOCATION>, at whose Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>; and Mrs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenall </PERSON>, a friend of the duchess. Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son and heir to the throne, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, his wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> and their two children, Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, 4. Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also there. After the ceremony, the guests went to Buckingham Palace for a tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took the official family photographs of the christening party.

<TEXT>
 Former Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, selected by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday for the high-level commission studying the deficit problem, is a Democrat who has been friends with the president-elect since they were classmates at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> long ago. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, 65, was a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> for 26 years before his defeat in <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 landslide. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, whose nickname is `` Lud'' from his middle name of <PERSON> Ludlow </PERSON>, is now president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group which represents the country's largest banks. He is considered one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oldest and closest friends. At <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, they were members of the secret society, Skull and Bones. Asked once to describe his friend, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said, `` He has spent a lifetime thinking in conventional terms, never reaching beyond them, never even wanting to.'' In announcing <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he expected to benefit from <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s `` counsel and his candor'' on the commission. `` I have had the privilege of knowing <PERSON> Lud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> for over 40 years,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement. `` He understands the full range of national issues _ from housing, to energy, to the problems of our cities.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to put his long-time friend on the panel gave supporters of the commssion hope that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may take its recommendations more seriously. During the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> derided the commission as a stalking horse for tax increases. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, considered a liberal Democrat while in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, served as ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and was also considered an expert on energy problems. Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> fought in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> during World War II and then entered <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> to resume his education. He received his undergraduate degree in 1948 and then earned a law degree by attending night classes at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> law school. He practiced law with his father and brother in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> before joining the staff of Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1952, where he served as assistant director for special projects for two years. He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1954, serving in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where his great-grandfather, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, had served during the Civil War.

<HEAD>China Says It Will Stop Aid To Insurgents If Vietnam Withdraws</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Tuesday announced it would stop aiding the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance forces as soon as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The statement, which appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, was a further indication that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s policy toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has softened. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s premier, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, made the statement at a news conference Monday with journalists from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> covering Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s visit. According to the report, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said `` if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, all parties, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, should stop aiding elements in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' In addition, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, `` in order to calm the fears of the international community, as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws, we will decrease our military assistance to the resistance forces.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 and unseated the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who had ruled the country from 1975. More than a million people are believed to have died during their bloody reign. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the capitalist countries of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the West support a three-party resitance coalition comprised of forces loyal to Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, a Western-leanding politician. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 and will turn the war over to the government of <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>, which it installed in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> in 1979. But the Cambodian forces are weak and there are widespread fears the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will return to power after <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> pulls out its forces. On Monday, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> announced another troop withdrawal. The troops were among the 50,000 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says are being sent home this year in its seventh annual partial pullout. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says the current withdrawal will leave 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has been evolving over the last few months as its relationship with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s main backer, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, improves Initially, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> demanded <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraw completely from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would even consider ceasing military aid. It also had expressed close support of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Over the summer, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> moved noticeably away from the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and began backing a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. In November, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said once the Vietnamese produced a timetable for the withdrawal, `` then the military assistance to all the four parties in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> must and also can be graduwlly reduced and even totally stopped.'' Tuesday's announcement marked a further revising of the Chinese position because it dropped the demand for a timetable.

<HEAD>US Skeptical on Vietnam's Withdrawal Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed skepticism Tuesday that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will fulfill its pledge to withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> before the end of the year. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> contends that its commitment is being met with the withdrawal of 18,000 troops this week. But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials insisted that even if the Vietnamese estimate of the size of the ongoing pullback is accurate, it would only bring the total for the year to between 28,000 and 33,000 troops. While welcoming this week's troop withdrawal, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said, `` We remain skeptical that the 50,000 pledge will be met.'' She estimated the current Vietnamese troop commitment to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> at between 90,000 and 100,000, down from about 120,000 at the start of the year. `` Since we believe <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s illegal occupation is the root cause of the conflict, we continue to urge <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to issue a precise timetable for the withdrawal of its remaining troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during 1989 and to allow for the verification of their withdrawal,'' she said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has indicated all its troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will be withdrawn by 1990. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said once all Vietnamese forces are withdrawn and there is an acceptable political settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be prepared to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Some previous administration statements had conditioned the establishment of normal ties with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s cooperation in accounting for the estimated 1,700 American servicemen listed as missing from the Vietnam War, but there was no such link included in Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>'s statement Tuesday. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday the MIA issue was being dealt with separately, and he cited statements by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other senior officials suggesting there was no explicit link between the MIA issue and normal relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But last July, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> linked diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> both to a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> settlement and to `` a resolution of the POW-MIA issue which, if left unsettled, will continue to divide our peoples.'' Asked whether the POW-MIA condition had been dropped, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said, `` We have been stressing that it is the complete withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces in the context of an acceptable settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> which will be the determining factor.'' <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s political future following the Vietnamese withdrawal is highly uncertain. The pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> has been fighting against three rebel groups, two of which are backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The third is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which is widely accused of having engaged in mass genocide when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> between 1975 and 1978. An alternate approach to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was outlined in a report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group. The report recommended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> take `` graduated'' diplomatic steps toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> if its troops are withdrawn from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> prior to a <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> settlement. These steps should include the establishment of small diplomatic missions in each other's capital and adjustments in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the report said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is one of a handful of countries with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not maintain diplomatic relations.

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Tuesday fired the lone non-white member of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> following completion of an inquiry into corruption in the Indian chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amichand </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON> was ousted by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> from his seat on the Cabinet, where he served without a portfolio, and also from his post as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. The only other non-white ever to serve on the Cabinet, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, was forced to resign last year after a dispute with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> over the future of residential segregation laws. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> is leader of the mixed-race house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is dominated by the white chamber and excludes the country's black majority. <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON>'s ouster came a week after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> received the official report on a two-month inquiry into alleged irregularities and corruption in the House of Delegates. <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON> had been suspended from the Cabinet pending the outcome of the hearings, which were conducted in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> by a former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. The report has not been made public, and it is not known whether any criminal charges might be filed as a result of the investigation. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> did not specify his reasons for firing <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON>, saying merely that the action was taken `` in view of the findings'' of the inquiry commission. Among the allegations made during the inquiry were that contracts for providing school textbooks went to booksellers who donated money to <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON>'s party, that <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON> was involved in improper allocations of business permits, and that he improperly interfered in civil service appointments. <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON>, 46, became a fulltime politician in 1980. He worked previously as a sports administrator, soccer referee, teacher, and spokesman for the dairy industry. He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 from a district near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> after adoption of a new constitution which created the Indian and mixed-race parliamentary chambers. Anti-apartheid activists of all races opposed the constitution because it excluded blacks, and there was a widespread boycott of the elections.

<TEXT>
 About 120 people stormed the parliament building Tuesday during a hearing on a 1980 civil uprising that was put down by the military, and they demanded the truth be told about the bloody incident. The protesters, identifying themselves as relatives of victims of the uprising, clashed with scores of guards in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building as they tried to enter the hearing room. The uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> was the worst in modern South Korean history. By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than 800 others injured or wounded when the army moved in. The opposition charges the incident was set up as part of a plot by army generals to seize power in the chaotic days that followed the assassination of the late president <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-hee </PERSON> in late 1979. `` Reveal the truth of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>,'' the protesters shouted today as they moved up and down a corridor of the assembly building, breaking two porcelain decorations. Opposition lawmakers persuaded the protesters into a room, where they staged a sit-down for four hours. After the sit-down, the protesters drove in three buses to the presidential mansion, but were stopped 700 yards away. Police took them to nearby police stations. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kye-ryang </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group, told police the group was protesting what he called a lackluster effort by the assembly to get at the facts of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> rejected a government offer of financial compensation before all the facts of the incident are fully divulged. He demanded that he and other protesters be allowed to testify at the hearing.

Members of a ranger unit commanded by <PERSON> Tatham </PERSON> opened fire on two suspected poachers, killing the one who appeared to be raising his rifle, said defense attorneys, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said rhinoceros horn was found at the scene of the shooting. Since 1984, more than 400 black rhinoceroses have been killed by poachers and rangers have killed more than 47 alleged poachers. A rhino horn can fetch up to $ 25,000 on the black market.

<HEAD>Drought-Reduced Grain Stockpiles Likely To Grow in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The searing 1988 drought cut deeply into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and global grain stockpiles, but the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that normal weather could improve things significantly by this time next year. Drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> lowered world crop production by more than 6 percent, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Crop prices will continue to reflect these smaller supplies early in 1989,'' the agency said in a new outlook report. `` But expanded output is likely in the second half, stopping the drawdown in stocks.'' Meanwhile, world supplies of animal products will remain large enough to dampen increases in livestock prices. However, the demand for both crop and animal products is expected to be bolstered by continued world economic expansion and population growth. The agency stuck to an earlier estimate that the net cash income of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers in 1989 is likely to be in the range of $ 48 billion to $ 52 billion, down from this year's record-tying estimate of $ 57 billion. `` Firm prices for most commodities and larger production will mean total farm receipts slightly above the 1988 record,'' the report said. `` Cash expenses are expected to rise moderately with expanded acreage and costlier inputs -LRB- production items -RRB-. Direct government payments to farmers are likely to fall one-fifth.'' As used by the agency, net cash income is the amount of money farmers have to spend during a calendar year and is the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales of grain stored from harvests in earlier years are counted as part of the current gross. In another method of bookkeeping, the agency measures `` net farm income'' for the year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system involved in `` net cash income.'' This method includes changes in the value of farm inventories, and allowances are made for `` non-money'' items such as depreciation, the family consumption of farm-grown food and the net rental value of dwellings. Net farm income for 1989 is forecast at $ 44 billion to $ 48 billion, compared with the estimate of $ 39 billion this year.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 750,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. It was the second consecutive day of large corn sales to the Soviets, with 750,000 tons announced on Monday. However, the department also announced the cancellation of 200,000 tons of soybean meal that had been scheduled for delivery to the Soviets in 1988-89. No explanation was given, but officials say conflicts in shipping schedules or price disagreements have been behind such cancellations in the past. The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets to more than 7.03 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of corn would be about 29.5 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.58 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 76 million. Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and 635,000 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Nov. 28 signed an extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run through Dec. 31, 1990. Under terms of the agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain annually, including a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent.

 Corporations reported a 3.9 percent rise in after-tax profits for the third quarter, down from an 8.9 percent surge in the previous quarter but substantially above the preliminary estimate last month, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said profits rose $ 6.4 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 169.1 billion for the third quarter. That's much better than the slight 0.2 percent rise reported a month ago, but the department noted that almost all of the improvement came from profits earned by overseas subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. The second quarter rise in profits had been the best in nearly five years. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, said the domestic operations of many companies are being caught in a profit squeeze. They are paying higher wages and higher interest rates, but have been unable to pass on price increases to consumers because of stiff competition both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and from overseas. `` We're going to see some pressure on prices because profits are becoming harder to earn, but companies are probably limited by competitive pressures. ... It will be hard for companies to reverse the kind of profit squeeze we're starting to see,'' he said. Corporate profits before taxes rose 2.6 percent in the third quarter to $ 313.9 billion, following a 6.9 percent increase in the previous three-month period. Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.5 percent to $ 105.7 billion in the third quarter, up from a 1.8 percent gain in the second quarter. Corporate cash flows, a measure intended to show the funds corporations have available for investment, rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter, following a 1.4 percent rise in the April-June period. Investment spending by manufacturing companies enjoying a boom in export sales has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. Reduced growth in corporate cash flows could eventually cut into capital spending expansion.

 The number of Americans behind in their mortgage payments fell in the July-September quarter to the lowest levels in a year, an organization of lenders said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said 4.73 percent of the payments on the 10.8 million mortgages surveyed in the third quarter were at least 30 days late. It was the lowest rate since the third quarter of 1987, when 4.71 percent of the mortgage payers were behind. The rate a year ago was the lowest in eight years. In the second quarter, the delinquency rate was 4.90 percent. The foreclosure rate edged down to 0.26 percent in the third quarter, compared with 0.27 percent in the second quarter. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the association, said he was `` very heartened'' by the decline, but the report noted a mixed pattern regionally. In North Central states, the delinquency rate was 4.88 percent, down from 5.30 percent a year ago. The rate in the Northeast was unchanged from a year ago at 4.12 percent, the lowest of four regions. However, the rate in the South rose from 5.25 percent last year to 5.29 percent. The rate in the West was 4.28 percent in the third quarter, up from 4.10 percent a year ago. A high employment level in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> generally has helped keep delinquencies low. The South has had a relatively high rate because <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other Southwestern states are struggling with a depressed oil industry. Two offsetting trends will affect delinquencies next year. Interest rates are rising, increasing the monthly payments on adjustable-rate mortgages. However, the economy is expected to remain strong, at least through mid-year, keeping the unemployment rate low.

 Seven instructors at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>'s airborne school were fined and demoted for socializing with students at the base in violation of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s fraternization policy Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, battalion commander, said several female students alleged that they had sex with instructors, but <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> only found evidence that instructors were dating students and of `` improper senior-subordinate relationships.'' Airborne instructors in three of the four companies in the 1st Battalion of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment have been or are being investigated for socializing, dating or sexually harassing female airborne students, post officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ledger-Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>. Seven were punished, appealed and had their appeals denied. All were demoted in rank and fined the equivalent of one month's pay. The demotions of four were suspended for six months, which means their ranks will be restored if no further infractions are charged against them during that time. The students were not punished, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, because he wanted them to continue to give information about the instructors' conduct. They also were not punished, he said, because instructors are in supervisory positions and know the fraternization policy, but students _ even though they are given briefings on it _ are not as familiar with the policy. The investigations began when a student was questioned about an unrelated incident and told brigade officers that instructors were dating students, a violation of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s fraternization policy. The instructors are non-commissioned officers who teach and supervise students in a three-week airborne course. The course is one of the few at the post with students of both sexes. Col. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Teel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> commander, said the incidents were not that significant considering 25,000 students go through the course each year. The School Brigade oversees the airborne school. `` I'm really rather surprised we do n't get more -LRB- sexual harassment -RRB- allegations than we do,'' he said. `` The investigation found that it was not very widespread at all.'' In an attempt to help solve the problem, <PERSON> Teel </PERSON> has hired a female instructor and is asking for other qualified women to volunteer for instructors' positions.

 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Tuesday asked for compromise in the ethnic dispute between the republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and accused nationalists of using <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s devastating earthquake to sow strife in the region In a report that kept up a media attack on activists on both sides of the ethnic dispute, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda said officials arrested nine people on suspicion of inciting unrest in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> met with members of Armenian artists' unions in the capital <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He had been in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> almost two weeks to oversee relief efforts following the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 55,000 people and left more than 500,000 people homeless. The quake came after three weeks of unrest between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in which at least 31 people were killed and more than 180,000 fled to escape the violence. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> attacked `` adventurists who jointly with corrupt and hooligan elements hamper the effort to overcome the aftermath of the natural disaster even when the resources of the people are taxed to the utmost, try to sow ethnic strife, provoke illegal actions, and in the long run, undermine the spiritual health of the nation.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials have expressed frustration that the earthquake has not eased strains between the two southern Soviet republics. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> wants to annex the predominantly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and central authorities have rejected annexation. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> and the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutunyan </PERSON>, called for a compromise solution. They spoke at a televised news conference. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> directive in July rejecting <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s annexation demand had not solved the problem <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gathered Armenian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> following a session of the Supreme Soviet parliament at the end of last month. On the basis of that meeting, <PERSON> Arutunyan </PERSON> said, local officials were working to meet a deadline for a compromise solution within 12 days. However, he said the earthquake interrupted the work on the seventh day. In a report from <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, where some of the worst ethnic violence took place last month, Pravda said three Armenians _ <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muradyan </PERSON>, <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisyan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulgazaryan </PERSON> _ were held for investigation for allegedly inciting ethnic unrest among Armenians living in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. It said the three flew to the <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION> region several times in a helicopter to organize meetings. Pravda said a fourth person, former Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> worker L.G. <PERSON> Mirzoyan </PERSON>, was arrested for interference in agricultural work. The report said in a report from the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, that five people were arrested on suspicion of taking bribes totaling about $ 160,000. It accused the five, workers in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, of helping organize unsanctioned meetings and demonstrations and of causing Armenians, Russians and Jews to be fired from their jobs.

 Federal officials on Tuesday approved evacuation plans for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities near the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant despite Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contention that residents could not get away safely in an emergency. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which sends its findings to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to help the commissioners determine whether to issue a commercial operating license, also approved plans submitted by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> for its 17 municipalities that fall within the reactor's 10-mile emergency zone. The conclusions could help <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> eventually receive a full-power license, although plant officials still have not secured a 5 percent power permit to test <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s 1,150-megawatt reactor. The evacuation planning process for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has taken an extraordinary course since <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which has six towns within the 10-mile zone, refused to submit emergency plans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> argued that it would be impossible to evacuate the seacoast area safely, especially in the summer months when the region's narrow roads are congested with beach traffic. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s chief owner, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, submitted plans on behalf of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> municipalities last year after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> voted to change its rule to allow the utility-drafted plans in cases in which state and local officials refuse to participate. The 1987 rules change, which was met with cries of foul from lawmakers, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials, residents and anti-nuclear advocates, was upheld in September by a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials reviewed the utility-drafted <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plans under the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines, which include the `` realism doctrine.'' That agency policy assumes that state and local public safety officials would follow the utility-drafted evacuation blueprints. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, associate director of <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s state and local programs division, said in a letter accompanying the reports that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plan `` will be adequate to protect the health and safety'' of local residents after the company installs its emergency alert system. That system consists of 16 siren-equipped vans, plus several backup vans and a siren-equipped helicopter, that would alert <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents in case of an atomic emergency. Stationary sirens had been installed in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities, but <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials were forced to take them down by state and local opponents, who won their case in court. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> prepared to vote Wednesday on the final regulatory obstacles that have blocked <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s low-power testing license. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> has said he will move immediately to block the license in federal court. Both remaining issues surrounding the low-power permit involve the financial stability of <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s owners. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection reorganization in January. And in June, the fourth-largest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, withdrew from the project and halted its $ 2 million-a-month payments.

 A police official testified Tuesday that officers on the scene, not the governor, decided that 14 black lawmakers would be arrested during a demonstration against the Confederate battle flag atop the state Capitol. Testimony in the oft-delayed trial of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and 13 co-defendants ended Tuesday, but the judge hearing the case said he would not issue a verdict immediately. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, then a member of the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, and 13 other black lawmakers were arrested during their protest Feb. 2 and charged with trespassing. They say the Dixie battle flag atop the Capitol is a symbol of racial oppression. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was arrested after he grabbed the fence around the Capitol building, which is closed for renovation, and attempted to climb it. The other 13 defendants followed suit, with many simply placing their hands on the links in a symbolic protest. The only witness to testify Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, said it was left to him and state troopers to determine whether a violation of the law occurred. He said he had discussed security arrangements for the protest in advance with Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s staff, but that the governor was not at the scene and did not directly order the arrests. The defense rested after <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> testified. None of the defendants took the stand. District Judge <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, presiding over the non-jury case, said he would not issue a verdict until after reading written testimony by <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who was questioned by defense attorneys in his office Monday. The dispute over whether <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> would testify in person had been one reason the trial dragged on over seven weeks even though only eight hours of testimony was actually heard, spread over three days. Courtroom action came to a halt in mid-November when the defense called <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> as its first witness. Attorneys for the governor argued he should not have to appear, and the judge eventually agreed with them and let the governor testify by giving a deposition in his office. That delay was only one of several in the trial, which first had been set to begin March 11. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was removed from his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month after being sentenced to four years in federal prison on an unrelated extortion conviction. All 14 legislators were charged with second-degree trespassing, which carries a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment and a $ 500 fine upon conviction. The defendants claim they were protected by legislative immunity during the protest and that no trespass on state property occurred since they never got over the fence. The prosecution contended trespassing occurred when their hands gripped the fence.

<HEAD>Court Orders New Inquest into IRA Shootings; Journalists Challenge
IRA Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s highest court on Tuesday ordered a new inquest into the deaths of three unarmed guerrillas, refueling the controversy over whether police shoot <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects on sight. The Court of Appeals also overturned rulings by a coroner and a lower court, announcing that three policemen who fired the fatal shots at the disputed 1982 ambush can be compelled to testify. The High Court had upheld coroner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>'s ruling that the officers could not be forced to give evidence. But Lord Chief Justice Sir <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said, `` The fact that they are suspected of causing the deaths of the three deceased is not a reason in law why they should not be compelled to go into the witness box.'' But he added that the unidentified lawmen can refuse to give self-incriminating testimony. The policemen already have been acquitted of murdering one of the members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. They were among five officers who ambushed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Gervase </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Toman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The three allegedly failed to stop their car at a police checkpoint in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. The original inquest was adjourned in late November while <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerr </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Gervase </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerr </PERSON>, fought to have the courts order the policemen to testify and be cross-examined rather than submit written statements. The original inquest has been scrapped. Inquests still are pending into the deaths of three more unarmed Roman Catholics _ two guerrillas and a civilian teen-ager _ who died in two police ambushes in the same region. Police said the deaths, which occurred over a three-week period, came in the normal course of anti-terrorist activity. But subsequent evidence suggested the killings were deliberate and avoidable. They have opened a fresh chapter in a 6-year-old controversy over whether police conduct illegal campaigns to shoot <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects on sight instead of arresting them. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to oust British rule from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic. In a separate development, six British journalists announced a court challenge to the government's Oct. 18 ban on radio and television interviews with members of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, its legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, and its sympathizers. Financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, their High Court appeal argues the order is illegal, contravenes the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and conflicts with the principle of editorial independence. The measure aimed at silencing <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> propaganda applies to radio and TV interviews with the publicly funded <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and independent commercial networks, but not to newspapers or foreign media.

<TEXT>
 The government announced Tuesday it has picked a domestic company over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm to develop a new generation of battle tanks for the British army. But Officials said the new British tank would be required to meet stringent standards over a 21-month development period. If it fails, they reserved the right to choose the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> model or even a West German tank. Announcing the decision in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said the government would give the British company, <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 164 million grant to develop prototypes of its Challenger 2 Mark II tank by September 1990. In the final weeks, the choice appeared to have narrowed to the Challenger and the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> M1-A1, a tank made by the U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has used the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> M1-A1 for years. British government officials said they would stay in contact with the foreign companies in case the domestic tank fell short of expectations. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will have to hit these -LRB- development -RRB- targets and hit them well and proper if we are to proceed,'' <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government agonized over the decision, fearful of repeating the fiasco that ended in 1986 when it wrote off a dud British spy plane called the Nimrod. The Nimrod cost nearly $ 2 billion, but the government instead purchased the Airborne Warning and Control System planes from the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The final contract for the new piece of hardware will call for about 500 tanks to replace aging Chieftain tanks. The contract will be worth about $ 2.5 billion. Vickers Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Plastow </PERSON> discounted any similarities between the new tank and the Nimrod. `` There is no real parallel with <PERSON> Nimrod </PERSON>, no new state of the art hardware is involved,'' he said. General Dynamics Land Systems Division, based in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said it was disappointed but would wait on the sidelines in case the British tank falters. `` Should their development efforts not meet those standards, we would be prepared to re-enter discussions with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials concerning purchase of the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank to meet their <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> requirements,'' company officials said in a statement read Tuesday by spokesman <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Oskoian </PERSON>. Younger denied published reports that British army chiefs had pushed for the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> M1-A1: `` While it is nice to feel that the best possible tank will be British, it is not the driving force.'' <PERSON> Plastow </PERSON> had argued if the British government turned down its model, no other country would buy it. He said potential export orders to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other Middle and <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries totaling about $ 22 billion would be lost.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, named by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the commission looking for a solution to the deficit, is a longtime confidant of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and one whose own presidential hopes fell short for want of money. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> retired from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, giving up a likely safe seat from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. But more than a senator, he was a close friend and ally of the president, a man <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> described as like a brother. Their friendship dates to their days as governors of their adjoining states. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> was also general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and managed three <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidential campaigns. After giving up his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> sought to become heir to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative legacy and win the presidential nomination. But he found the going difficult, and he ended his presidential bid in mid-1987, more than a year before the election. He said it was the lack of money _ he had raised about $ 1 million, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was over the $ 9 million mark at that point. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a fast-moving town,'' he once remarked. `` You are a memory very quickly.'' His appointment by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may move him back into the spotlight a bit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and a Democrat, former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, as his representatives on the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The bipartisan commission is to recommend ways to close the federal budget deficit to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose `` read my lips'' campaign vow of no tax increases would seem to foreclose one option before the panel. The panel was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year after the stock market plunge. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> is the son of a Basque immigrant sheepherder, and still enjoys spending time at his family's remote, 120-acre camp in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevadas </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. He ran a casino in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, where he grew up and served as governor. More recently, <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> was embroiled in a $ 250 million libel suit against <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, over a story that said the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had evidence of skimming at his family's casino Both sides claimed victory in the suit's dismissal. He held no official position in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership, no committee chairmanship, and he rarely debated issues on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. Yet he had a hand in virtually every major decision of the first six years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, his power deriving from his closeness to the president.

 Immigration Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> has asked Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to wipe out a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unit that has supported Central Americans and others seeking asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an internal memo shows. At issue is the <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, which has prodded the department to override a number of <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> denials of asylum. One point `` we would like to raise with you is the validity of the <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s Dec. 13 memo to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, which was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` APRU has cost <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> appropriations $ 750,000 since inception. ... The entire purpose of APRU and its continued existence should now be reviewed by your staff.'' <ORGANIZATION> APRU </ORGANIZATION> reviews of asylum rejections by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> are `` just plain financially wasteful,'' said the memo. <ORGANIZATION> APRU </ORGANIZATION> has persuaded <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider denials in 35 cases and has referred another 35 cases to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who then directed reversals, said department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> APRU </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1987 to monitor <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> asylum operations following a 1985 incident in which a Soviet seaman who jumped ship on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was returned to his Soviet vessel on orders of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol. The border patrol is part of INS. `` The establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unit was a positive development in that it recognized that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> was incapable of handling the asylum function,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. His group favors removing <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> from the asylum process altogether. `` This office serves a vital purpose'' and its staff is dedicated to ensuring that `` the purposes of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asylum policy are carried out,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, the unit's director, who declined to respond directly to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s memo. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> is urging the change in connection with proposed regulations, first discussed three years ago, which would implement the Refugee Act of 1980. That law established the standard of granting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> haven to refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution in their homelands. The proposed regulations are finally being shaped at a time when Nicaraguans and other Central Americans are pouring across the border illegally and then seeking asylum, saying they have been persecuted in their home country. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s memo asks <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to review the regulatory proposals and to issue a final regulation by the end of the year. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until later this week and has not yet conducted discussions on the proposed regulations. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> declined to comment on the memo, saying that `` we do n't want to set a precedent'' in which `` each memo gets publicly discussed before it gets decided.'' Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> obtained internal <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> documents outlining a program under which Nicaraguans and other Central Americans seeking asylum would no longer be granted work permits while their applications are pending. INS is assigning additional personnel to handle the applications in an attempt to shorten the decision time on the applications to 30 days or less, a process which could ultimately result in deportations for those whose claims are rejected. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s memo also asked <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to modify a regulatory proposal that would set up a centralized system of skilled officers who consider asylum applications and who would receive training from <ORGANIZATION> APRU </ORGANIZATION>. The commissioner instead wants the asylum officers placed under the control of district immigration directors around the country. Under that decentralized approach, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> examiners last year granted asylum requests from 110 Salvadorans and rejected 3,822 other Salvadoran requests for asylum; granted asylum requests from 2,786 Nicaraguans and denied 2,455 others; and granted requests from 24 Guatamalans while denying 447 others. `` Asylum applications have almost tripled in the past year due primarily to the more permissive approach to work authorization,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s memo. `` We need to take the necessary steps to prevent the existing situation and avoid the proliferation of this situation.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was referring to a July 1987 statement by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> which directed <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to encourage applications for work authorizations from Nicaraguans seeking asylum. Some 60,700 people applied for asylum in fiscal 1988, up from 26,100 the previous year.

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, accused of murdering his illegally adopted daughter, opened their defense Tuesday with an assault on the credibility and character of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s chief accuser and former live-in companion. Police Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Andry </PERSON> testified he had found a woman who looked just like <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> drinking a beer and smoking in a stranger's car while <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the 6-year-old girl the couple raised, was unconscious in the family apartment nearby. He said he was convinced it was, indeed, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. In seven days of graphic testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that she never left the house after <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> fell unconscious, sometime around 7 p.m. on Nov. 1, 1987. The prosecution maintains <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was unconscious because <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had struck her before going out to dinner with a friend. `` The focus of this trial has shifted from <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> to <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyer, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said outside the courtroom. He said there were unexplained bruises on <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s body, and implied that the defense will suggest Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was responsible. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree murder in the child's death. He denies that he hit the child, but Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that he told her he had struck <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andry </PERSON> said that he found Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> sitting, slumped down, in a car near the couple's <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment around 8:40 p.m. on Nov. 1, 1987. He said he asked the woman if the car was hers. She said no, and he told her to get out. She did. `` Her nose was distorted like it was messed up somehow. Her eyes looked like they were dazed,'' he said. The officer's description of the woman fit the description of Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a former children's book author and editor, at the time of her arrest Nov. 2, 1987. Charges against her were later dropped after prosecutors concluded she was too severely battered by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to have prevented <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death. `` Is there any question as you sit here today that the woman you saw sitting in the car on West 10th Street was <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>?'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> asked. `` There's no question about it,'' the officer replied. Earlier in the day, the prosecution rested after presenting 39 witnesses since the trial began more than eight weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> denied a defense request to throw out all charges against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. He did say he was inclined to drop one charge against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, endangering the welfare of the 16-month-old boy police found in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s apartment the morning they took the unconscious <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> to a hospital The boy was illegally adopted, just as <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was. He has since been returned to his biological mother. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> also said he would also instruct the jury to consider two lesser homicide counts not included in the indictment against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. They are second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> is also charged with second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a minor with respect to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. The prosecution's last witness, Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was a victim of child abuse. She based her opinion on medical and autopsy reports and color photographs taken of the child. She said that findings of multiple bruises, the child's poor hygiene and the brain hemorrhage <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> suffered were consistent with child abuse.

 About 300 people marched to the presidential palace Tuesday, the anniversary of the world's worst peacetime ship disaster, and declared a curse on the government and the shipping line. Protesters burned two papier mache models of ships to commemorate the Dec. 20, 1987, collision of the inter-island ferry <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> and the oil tanker Vector off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. More than 3,000 people were killed. Two men slits the throats of two chickens and spattered the models with blood. The marchers stopped and held their rally after police blocked them at a bridge leading to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s office. `` In the name of all our loved ones, wherever they are, we swear that all those responsible shall be made to pay for the deaths and injustices they caused,'' members of the crowd chanted in unison. `` We will not lose hope until all those responsible are punished.'' A presidential commission said at least 3,563 people were aboard the two ships, but only 26 survived. Survivors and relatives say the government and the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>'s owners, <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, should provide more compensation to victims' families and take more steps to prevent future maritime disasters. Tuesday's protesters lit candles to set fire to the papier mache models. As the flames set off firecrackers inside the models, hundreds wailed and began reciting a curse traditional among people of the central <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> islands, which was home to most of the victims. `` We vow to be more active in the attainment of justice for our loved ones and all other victims of oppression,'' the crowd recited. During the rally, one survivor of the disaster, <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galang </PERSON>, told the crowd the <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> had offered him money to testify that the oil tanker was at fault in the collision, but he said he refused. `` They think they can buy lives with their money,'' he said. He also laid blame on `` this uncaring government.'' Relatives of some victims say the government has tried to pressure them into accepting compensation offered by the ship owners. <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Popes </PERSON>, who said she lost her mother and 11 other relatives aboard the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, said she did not receive any financial assistance from the government. She said <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> gave her $ 1,500. <PERSON> Nazzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Cajolo </PERSON>, who reported losing five brothers in the disaster, said the shipping line offered a $ 7,500 settlement. He said his family rejected it. Cajolo is one of about 300 people who have filed a class-action lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Philippine domestic shipping company. The suit was rejected by a lower court, but an appeal is pending. Sulpicio Lines suffered another blow last Oct. 24 when its passenger ship <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, sank in Typhoon Ruby. About 300 people were killed.

 Bogus steam valve parts have been found at a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, marking the third type of counterfeit equipment uncovered in the industry in the last two years, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was told Tuesday. The commission staff issued a special notice to nuclear utilities last week asking them to be on the lookout for counterfeit valve parts of all kinds, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> of the commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. Failure of the valves could not cause a nuclear accident, he said. Instances of counterfeit bolts and fasteners were found two years ago. Earlier this year, counterfeit circuit breakers were found at plants in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Industry-wide inspections, ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> last month, turned up a second type of bogus breaker, this one at the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Quad Cities plant in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said. He reported also that in late October, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unwittingly bought a number of counterfeit valve parts for its <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said a failure of such parts could lead to an automatic shutdown of the reactor Consumers Power discovered the faulty parts when a repaired valve leaked, <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said. `` Some of the parts they had procured turned out to be misrepresented and counterfeit,'' and an investigation by the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Masoneilan-Dresser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, concluded `` there appeared to be a counterfeit market,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff does not yet know how extensive the counterfeit market is. It is worried because `` valves are quite frequently refurbished'' and new stems, gates and other parts are being bought all the time, <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, Consumers spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopick </PERSON> said a company consultant discovered suspect parts during a major valve renovation project. Some parts were discarded on the spot as obviously no good, some were thrown out after special tests showed they did not meet specifications and some were installed after the tests showed they could be used, he said. <PERSON> Knopick </PERSON> said he was unable to agree with <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> that the parts had been misrepresented by the seller: `` It's too early to conclude that. That's still under investigation.'' Palisades was closed for refueling a month early in August when a steam generator developed a leak, and the valve project was undertaken during the downtime. It was restarted Dec. 1 and ran for six days before being shut down again because of another steam generator leak, and <PERSON> Knopick </PERSON> said Consumers hopes to restart it before the end of the year. The counterfeiting, according to the staff notice to utilities, `` may extend to other manufacturers.'' A large nuclear plant may have as many as 40,000 valves of all kinds, 10 times as many as a coal plant of the same power rating. A counterfeit valve found earlier at the Diablo Canyon plant of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` appears to be an isolated case,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>, chief of the vendor inspection branch. The Quad Cities circuit breaker was of a large-capacity, metal-cased design that can be refurbished. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> breakers were totally enclosed in plastic and designed to be replaced, not repaired or refurbished, <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said. The Illinois component had been put through a `` substandard refurbishment'' in which parts were used that were `` non-genuine and non-conforming dimensionally,'' he said. `` A number of activities are under way to identify the source of the refurbishment,'' he said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, executive director for operations, told the commission the staff soon would propose a tightening of regulations on inspection of parts on arrival from vendors. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> of the Office of Investigations said the staff was pursuing 20 investigations of counterfeit parts.

 The government named institutions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Tuesday to serve as the first three regional centers to help funnel scientific advancements to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses so they can better compete against Japanese and other trade rivals. `` We've been winning the Nobel prizes and the Japanese have been winning the profits,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a sponsor of the legislation which established the program. He spoke at a news conference organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to announce the choice of the three non-profit centers, from among 36 applicants. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said there will be additional centers, but he was uncertain whether three or five more will be sought in the next federal budget. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has authorized 12 centers altogether, but provided money only for the first three: $ 12 million for the year ending next Sept. 30, to be matched by money from indidividual states and the institutions concerned. The first centers will be at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` The centers will help smaller firms take advantage of some of the recent and dramatic advances in manufacturing technology,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. The centers will inform firms in their areas about new technology, help them evaluate their needs, support training for their work forces and share their experiences with others. <PERSON> Rensselaer </PERSON> will concentrate on businesses producing parts for the auto, consumer appliance and electronics industries. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> will concentrate on metal fabrication. The Cleveland group will deal largely with manufacturing. The program is being administered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, a new body succeeding the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> and established by the trade law President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed last August.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Tuesday picked <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON>, his chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counsel, to be his chief of staff. <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON>, 60, also had expressed an interest in returning to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration as associate solicitor for legislation he helped draft the 1970 Occupational Health and Safety Act establishing <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. An 18-year Capitol Hill veteran in various staff positions, <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON> will oversee a vice presidential staff of 90 once Qualye assumes office Jan. 20. `` This is the first offer I got and it's the best offer I'm going to get so I took it,'' <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s announcement. `` It took me between three and seven seconds.'' <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON> was named by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his chief counsel last year after Democrats assumed control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> following the 1986 election. From 1981 through 1984 he was the chief counsel on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on employment and productivity that was chaired by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.

<HEAD>UNICEF: Debt Crisis Killing Children in Developing World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A half-million children died last year because their Third World countries slashed social welfare spending when faced with unprecedented debt, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in its annual report. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> executive director, urged leaders of industrialized and developing nations to convene a summit to deal with the crisis. He made the appeal in <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report, `` The State of the World's Children,'' which he formally released at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> news conference telecast live to 40 nations. The 500,000 children he mentioned represented only a fraction of the child deaths in 1987 recorded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund. `` Three million children died last year because they did n't have 50 cents worth of vaccine in them,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. Half these deaths occurred in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Among a few bright spots he highlighted were vaccination programs in two war-torn countries. `` In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in the midst of war, they have been able to stop the war long enough to immunize their children,'' he said. Failure to vaccinate children results not only from the debt crises but from war, ignorance, lack of health workers and rugged terrains isolating people from medical care. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said that for children these were the best and worst of times. `` They are the worst of times because after 35 years of progress, a significant percentage of mankind _ 900 million people _ is now sliding backward into poverty,'' he said. `` It's the best of times, because low-cost ways -LRB- of preventing children's deaths -RRB- are becoming increasingly available.'' These methods include vaccination against diseases such as measles, tetanus and whooping cough. Others are oral rehydration programs, using inexpensive salt solutions that combat diarrhea, chief killer of small children in many impoverished nations. One of the most alarming trends he noted was that 16 nations made less progress against child mortality last year than they were making a decade ago because their debt-burdened governments have had to cut back on social spending. `` By far the heaviest consequences are being borne by the children,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. `` For these 16 countries alone, the number of child deaths in the last 12 months is approximately 650,000 more than would have been the case if the 1970-80 rate of decline in under-five mortality had continued.'' The 16 nations cited by <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> report said `` the developing world is now transferring $ 20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it receives in new aid and loans.'' Developing nations owe $ 1.2 trillion to foreign governments, private banks and development funds. `` It's clear that in the'80s, private contributions for development have doubled while government assistance has declined,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` The governments should increase their aid, but there is also the question of public opinion insisting that they do so.'' Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, in a pre-recorded preface to <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s telecast, said: `` Not only are the present needs of children neglected but in our greedy growth to development, we are threateing to mortgage their future.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen whose Canadian forebears served as doctors and medical missionaries in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, called for a world summit to focus attention and seek solutions to the problems of children. `` Why should n't political leaders of both developing and developed countries have a world summit on children?'' he asked. `` To reach the unreached, our conclusion is that one must first reach the unreached's leaders.''

 A spelunker who wrote a manual on how to find people lost in caves finally took part in his first rescue, leading a team that found two teen-agers just as searchers were beginning to fear the boys were in serious trouble. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON>, who has been a cave explorer for 20 years, and the team he formed nine years ago found two 16-year-old boys who had been stranded in a cave for about seven hours Sunday. `` For what they had been through, they were in extremely good condition,'' said <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON>. `` The good thing was, they were very calm.'' The Stone County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused to release the names of the two boys, saying they could face trespassing charges in juvenile court. The cave was on private property near here, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said he did not even know the boys' names. The two were reported missing after they failed to return from a Sunday afternoon outing at Salt Peter Cave. They became stranded after their two flashlights and a lantern went out, and waited in the cool, damp cave for more than seven hours before rescuers reached them, <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON>, who manages two other caves near here that are in an amusement park, was contacted by the local sheriff's department. `` Cave search and rescue is totally different from any other type of search and rescue,'' said <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON>, whose manual gives tips on cave rescues. `` It's important that an expert caver is leading the team on the initial assault,'' he said. Searchers should be `` very, very familiar and comfortable in the surroundings. If you've got the least little bit of anxiety about where you are, that distracts from the 10,000 other things that should be on your mind.'' <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> and three other experienced spelunkers entered the cave after 11 p.m. Sunday and crawled along an underground stream for 45 minutes without success. In most cave rescues, the victims are found within that time, <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said. Worried, he sent one of the initial team back to form another search team and set up an aid station within the cave. But soon after he took those steps, the boys were found waiting calmly for help at a point where the fairly simple passage became more complicated, <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said. `` They went an incredibly long distance, much further than we expected,'' <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said. `` The intrigue and interest in the cave has a way of luring people on beyond what their common sense should allow them.'' <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> estimated that the two had crawled four miles into the cave, but said he could not be sure. `` It's hard to tell how far you've gone when you're crawling on your belly through mud,'' he said. <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said he began exploring caves as a child, and became interested in cave rescues when four cave explorers died after becoming stranded in another southern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> cave 11 years ago. When he learned later that most of the members of the first rescue team had left the area, he turned to fellow explorers and formed his own team. `` Luckily, we're not needed very often,'' he said. `` We prepared ourselves long ago, and it's just not the kind of thing you forget.'' <PERSON> Herschend </PERSON> said he has been called on in the past when people have been believed lost in caves. But until Sunday, authorities either found the victims by themselves or it was discovered that the missing people were not in the cave after all.

<TEXT>
 Press freedom was undermined in 1988 by governments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other democracies, which should set examples of tolerance, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Tuesday. It called the development the `` most worrying aspect'' of its annual `` World Press Freedom Review,'' which surveyed the press in 82 countries on six continents. `` The hopes and encouragement of nations which are on their way toward more freedom and who rely on an example from countries with a democratic system, an open society and freedom, must not be crushed by governments in the free world,'' director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON> wrote in an introduction to the report. The institute, which has offices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, is an independent body representing 2,000 publishers and editors in more than 60 countries. Its report cited these examples of official interference: _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` continued its efforts to limit public access to information held by the American government. _ The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the conviction of a former intelligence analyst for giving satellite photographs of a Soviet ship to a British magazine <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> is serving two years in prison. _ Under the new Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement restricts Canadian journalists working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to those with university degrees and three years experience It was the first time the rule, already part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, was `` enshrined in an international accord.'' _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s British government tried to ban publication of extracts from the `` Spycatcher'' memoirs of former intelligence agent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> Newspapers defeated the government in court. _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> barred radio or television interviews with 11 groups involved in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in the `` most drastic action taken against British broadcasters in peacetime. _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the world's most populous democracy, agreed only at the last minute to withdraw legislation shifting the onus of proof of defamation from plaintiff to journalist _ A court court in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> ordered a journalist to reveal his sources _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> suspended three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> newspapers for up to 45 days and shut down the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, `` a prime source of information for the foreign press. Elsewhere, the report found, `` the media under dictatorships remained all too predictably under lock and key.'' In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> there were violent assaults on 24 foreign and Chilean journalists while five journalists in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> were forced to leave the country following passage of an anti-terrorist law, it said. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> cracked down on their press, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> continued to pressure the media and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reasserted control on open discussion and suppressed negative news. South Africa closed two church newspapers for three months and the country's most outspoken anti-apartheid paper, the Weekly Mail, was suspended for four weeks. On the other hand, the report said, many visible and invisible restrictions were lifted on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s press, and in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> economic and political liberalizations extended to the media. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the report declared, `` it seems that anything goes'' these days. `` No cow, it is tempting to believe, is too sacred to slaughter. In fact, however, matters are not as simple as that. ... We should never forget that glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB- began as, and remains, a policy guided from above.''

 Some government scientists working on the nuclear waste repository project in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> are unhappy about the `` quality assurance'' paperwork they must do, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said a recent tour he made of the proposed <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> site `` indicates that's a bit of a problem.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commented during a briefing by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radioactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, on recent waste activities. The commission will have to decide whether to issue a license, currently scheduled for 1995, to the department for operation of a permanent depot planned for <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. It will store for 10,000 years the highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel from the nation's reactors that is now building up at each reactor site It is the first operation of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to be subjected to the kind of scrutiny the commission has always given civilian nuclear power plants. The department's weapons-building activities are exempt from commission rules. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> agreed the waste depot project means `` some change in philosophy and culture,'' and assured <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> that `` field personnel will be trained'' in quality assurance. Though often confused with quality control, quality assurance is distinct: It is the proof of quality control, documentation that the work has been done correctly. An example might be a weld in a pipe in a nuclear power plant: An X-ray kept on file of the completed weld showing no flaws would be the assurance that the weld had been done correctly. In the civilian nuclear power industry, the commission insists on documentation of every step of work, and failure to conform has led some plants into costly reconstruction before completion. The waste project `` is imposing a regulatory process on scientists who have not operated in this mode in the past ... geologists, hydrologists,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. The dismay, he said, surfaced among `` people who were on the tour with me, some -LRB- of them -RRB- government people'' who `` expressed a little concern about this.'' In his presentation, <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> noted that the scheduled beginning of the first investigative drilling into <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> had been delayed five months to November 1989 `` to ensure that all necessary quality assurance plans and procedures and other necessary documentation and analyses are in place.'' Responding to <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` Quality assurance is an area we feel quite strongly about,'' as shown by the formation of a quality assurance unit several months ago in the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.

 Foreign diplomats must forget tradition and `` play the American game'' if they want to be effective in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the retiring <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> ambassador said Tuesday. Ambassador <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotlieb </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> audience that `` In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a foreign government is a special interest and not a very special one at that.'' `` If you want to be a successful diplomat in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, forget what you have ever learned about traditional diplomacy,'' said <PERSON> Gotlieb </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seven years ago. `` Get up, get out on the field, and play the American game.'' He likened the political scene to a large magnetic field crowded with thousands of electrically charged players, ranging from politicians to lobbyists and reporters, who sometimes form harmonious patterns but often repel each other. `` Political action committees, dressed as trainers, dispense the steroids of modern politics _ money _ to the players on all sides,'' he said. `` There are no referees.'' On the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political scene, `` every country is famous for 15 minutes,'' he said, adding that Americans mainly were interested in the recent Canadian election because it affected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agenda. He was asked about an incident several years ago, in which his wife <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> slapped the face of the embassy's social secretary at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dinner for Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gotlieb </PERSON> said his effectiveness as a diplomat was not harmed by what he termed `` a spontaneous and unfortunate incident.'' <PERSON> Gotlieb </PERSON>, who is retiring from public service after 30 years, becomes chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 1 and will be a visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, for the spring term before settling in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A short circuit in Christmas tree ornaments apparently sparked a fire Tuesday that destroyed a single-story home, killing four young children and critically burning two other people. The dead children ranged in age from 1 to 5 years old. Two, a 4-year-old boy and his 1-year-old sister, were dead at the scene, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Two brothers, ages 5 and 1, died at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. `` The preliminary investigation indicates the fire was caused by a short circuit in the ornaments on the Christmas tree in the living room,'' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 22, the uncle of two of the dead children, said he was sleeping in that room when the fire began about 3 a.m. He warned the families and was credited with saving three occupants. `` By the time I ran to the rooms to get the children out, the flames were on me,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. `` I did n't even know I was burned, I was trying so hard to get everyone else out.'' Firefighters found the single-story home almost completely engulfed in flames when they arrived, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. He identified the dead youngsters as <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ealy </PERSON>, 4, and his sister <PERSON> Marnecia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ealy </PERSON>, 1, and brothers <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Cedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 1. The boys' older sister, <PERSON> Lekeisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 15, was in critical condition at <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with burns and respiratory injuries, pending transfer to the Shriners' Hospital in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>.

 Some members of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of betraying them in recent talks with anti-government rebels, Western diplomats said Tuesday.

 Researchers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have isolated the AIDS virus and its African cousin from the same patient, showing both can infect the same individual, scientists report. Previous studies had suggested the two viruses could infect the same person, but the new study confirms it by isolating the viruses themselves, researchers said. In a tatement from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, researchers said the finding indicates that individuals infected with one strain should continue to take precautions against becoming infected by the second.

The work appears in the Dec. 17 issue of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lancet </LOCATION>, a British medical journal.

 Kremlin officials ended their direct supervision of earthquake relief efforts Tuesday, and attention turned to rebuilding <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s wrecked cities to withstand future quakes. The return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of the Politburo commission led by Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, which went to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> the day after the Dec. 7 earthquake, indicated rescue operations were coming to an end and a long period of reconstruction was beginning. For the first time since the first days after the quake, news from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was bumped from the lead item on the evening TV news program `` Vremya.'' It was replaced by a report on a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> conference of educators. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said more than 500 children had been reunited with parents or relatives in recent days. A leading Soviet seismologist, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Laverov </PERSON>, told the agency tremors continued but their pattern indicated they would fade. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, in a news conference broadcast on nationwide television Tuesday, criticized what he said was the `` very low quality of construction'' of multistory apartment buildings destroyed by the earthquake. The official media said plans were being set to reconstruct cities such as <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> to prevent a repeat of the disaster. `` A decision was made to use a method of construction where low buildings are erected abutting one another. This will help create a kind of stone belt which will become a protective hoop in case of an earthquake,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The cities will be rebuilt with low stone houses as well as more standard concrete and reinforced concrete buildings, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The earthquake that devastated northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> killed an estimated 55,000 people. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said 514,000 people were left homeless. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a group of architects, seismologists, geologists and other experts were working in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to develop plans for rebuilding the cities. It promised that all plans would be offered to the public for debate. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported that sketches had been prepared for construction of about 3,000 single-family houses with yards. It said that in the near future, a special store would be opened where individuals building their own homes can buy the materials they need. A government commission has been formed to study why five - and nine-story prefabricated concrete apartment houses built in the last 20 years crumbled in the earthquake, while many older buildings remained standing despite damage <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said preliminary findings indicated that the new buildings could not withstand sharp lengthwise shifts in the ground. The earthquake, centered about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. In an interview with Soviet television, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the first stage of the relief operation _ that of rescuing survivors _ would end in `` several days,'' echoing reports in the official media. The last rescue of an earthquake survivor was reported to have occurred Saturday. In a meeting with reporters on Dec. 12, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said he, Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and fellow Politburo member <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON> would remain in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to oversee the relief efforts until they were certain work was going well and `` the necessary rhythm of work is guaranteed.'' He said in an interview with Soviet TV that the commission would return in January. Asked about the danger of epidemic in the earthquake areas, where thousands of bodies still have not been recovered, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told his interviewer there was no such danger in the large cities. He said a danger had existed in villages because of the presence of thousands of dead animals, but that special teams had the problem under control. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who arrived in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last week and visited <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` I will soon return here together with my sister nuns to extend aid to the sufferers.'' `` We have been stunned by the scale of the disaster,'' she was quoted as saying. There was no further word on whether she and Soviet officials had reached a firm agreement for <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> to work in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where charity work by religious organizations is prohibited by law. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Monday. Since a visit last year, she has been trying to open the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to her missionaries.

 Winter started a day early out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and snowfall of up to 10 inches was reported in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> basked in record-breaking warmth. High winds were a factor in at least three deaths in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. A strong cold front off the coast of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> started to spread wintry weather across much of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states. Winter arrives at 10:28 a.m. EST Wednesday. Light rain fell at midday along the northern and central <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and snow fell in inland portions of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. As the storm system moved farther inland, snow was expected to increase and become more widespread, especially in mountain areas, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. A winter storm warning was posted for the northern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> range of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as well as higher elevations of the western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> mountains and the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> basin. Between 1 and 2 feet of snow was expected in parts of the region. Another winter storm warning remained in effect for the Cascade and <PERSON> Siskyou </PERSON> mountains of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Winter storm watches and snow advisories were posted for other parts of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, snow fell overnight and into Tuesday morning in the northern mountains, with accumulations up to 6 inches reported in the higher canyon areas. Elsewhere, a low pressure area moving through the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> spread rain, freezing rain and drizzle over northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> as well as central and eastern <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Heavy snow fell in western <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with Ironwood receiving 7 inches of new snow and Ontonagan 8 to 10 inches. Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 0.48 inch at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; 0.38 inch at <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; and 0.24 inch at <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. During the same six hours, an inch of snow fell at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Winds gusted to 70 mph in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, 60 mph in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and 53 mph at South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. Wind gusts were so strong in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> that a wall under construction collapsed, killing a construction worker. Wind gusts of 35 mph were blamed for fanning a rapidly spreading blaze that killed a teen-age girl and her 21-year-old brother at their home in <LOCATION> Gifford </LOCATION>, Ill. Temperatures early Tuesday afternoon were in the single digits and teens in northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. But record warm weather was reported in parts of the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states to the Great Lakes, including 49 at <LOCATION> Alpena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; 63 in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; 57 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; 43 in <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; and 63 in <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8 degrees at International Falls, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to 82 degrees at <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The early-morning low for the nation Tuesday was 4 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Cutbank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The forecast for Wedneday called for a cold front to move across the Appalachians, producing showers and thunderstorms from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The weather system that moved into the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Tuesday was expected to spread rain across all of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and snow over much of the <LOCATION> Intermountain </LOCATION> region between the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and the mountains of eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, as well as the northern and central Rockies.

<TEXT>
 Regional and linguistic antagonisms that have threatened unity throughout <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s history are reviving because Quebec will not comply with a ruling that it allow the posting of signs in English. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said last week the predominantly French-speaking province is justified in making sure French predominates on signs but can not prevent the use of other languages. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, the provincial premier, angered both English speakers and militants from the majority with his compromise last Sunday: French must remain the only language on outdoor signs but other languages can be used indoors so long as French predominates. Environment Minister <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, one of four English speakers in <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s Cabinet, resigned Tuesday and said: `` In my beliefs, rights are rights are rights. There are no partial rights. There are no indoor-outdoor rights.'' Two of the other English speakers _ Public Security Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and Communications Minister <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> _ quit later Tuesday. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> based his decision on a clause put into the constitution by Western provinces as a protection against federal power, which allows provinces or the national government to override a court decision. The resumption of divisiveness in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> followed four years of general calm that made possible the 1987 <LOCATION> Meech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> constitutional agreement recognizing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as a `` distinct society.'' Only eight of the 10 provinces have ratified the accord, named for the place in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> where it was signed. Premier <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Filmon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> said Monday he no longer would push for legislative approval in his Western province because of <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s action. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, is the other province yet to ratify the agreement. <PERSON> Filmon </PERSON> described the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> decision as a `` national tragedy'' and called for a national conference of provincial leaders to persuade the French-speaking province to accept the court decision. Which language can be used on signs is a volatile and symbolic issue <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s French speakers _ 81 percent of the population _ consider essential to preserving their linguistic and cultural heritage. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s plan prohibits languages other than French on signs both outdoors and in such places as shopping malls and interiors of public transportation facilities. An editorial Tuesday in The Globe and Mail of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> said: `` What now? Almost certainly a hardening of hearts, a less generous attitude, an unwillingness to spend precious political capital on bilingualism and francophones, tougher questioning of the primordiality granted to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s concerns; in sum, a quiet, unspectacular but undeniable backlash that will do us all no good.'' La Presse, a widely read <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> daily, said <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> chose `` the best compromise under the circumstances.'' It said either continuing the ban on any language other than French or allowing bilingual signs everywhere `` would have been to scorn Quebec reality, both historic and present.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> campaigned for election on a platform that included easing language restrictions on signs. Critics say he could have avoided angering militants if he had acted soon after the election instead of responding to a court ruling three years later. A crowd of 10,000 or more attended a rally Sunday in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> demanding no changes in the language law, which was passed in 1977 by the separatist Parti Quebecois gpverment. Power in the province shifted from the English-speaking minority to the French speakers in the 1970s. Separatist sentiment abated after the language law was passed and Quebec's voters rejected a sovereignty in a 1980 referendum.

He compared his income to that of <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. `` His year-to-date salary was $ 103,000 and change,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. `` I got $ 71,000 and some change, including the bonus.'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Panichi </PERSON>, treasurer for the <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> campaign, did n't dispute <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' math but said the $ 103,000 probably reflected money <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> earned from pre-1988 campaign work as well as for his work in 1988 `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> worked for 18 months for $ 103,000. I do n't think that's outrageous,'' <PERSON> Panichi </PERSON> said `` Of course he was worth it,'' said <PERSON> Panichi </PERSON>, who was calling from a car phone and was unable to verify immediately the amounts and dates in campaign records. <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> records show no bonuses. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who has returned to his pre-campaign job of running <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff, said `` Did I deserve $ 71,000? The answer is yes. People across the country said it was one of the two or three best-run campaigns in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was an $ 8.5 million venture.'' He said the money partly reimbursed him for what he would have earned had he remained on the senator's government payroll as administrative assistant, and partly reflected the going rate for managing large campaigns. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlopak </PERSON>, the former executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said big-state campaign managers are paid `` anywhere from $ 60,000 - $ 70,000 on the low end to $ 100,000-plus on the high end The sky's the limit.'' `` Add $ 50,000 to that for the Republican side,'' he said. In all, <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> spent about $ 8 million in his unsuccessful bid to unseat <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, who spent about $ 8.5 million.

 Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums Tuesday and police said at least one person was killed. Six people were reported wounded. Shopkeepers in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> slums lowered their shutters and pedestrians and motorists took cover when the Shiites began shooting at each other with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. Police said they did not know what started the battle shortly after 6 p.m. between Amal, a mainstream militia backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The two militias compete for the leadership of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the nation's largest sect.

 The White House said Tuesday that $ 150 million of unspent <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> funds `` can be used immediately to begin whatever work is necessary to improve the safety conditions'' at plants producing nuclear weapons. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked about a Dec. 9 letter by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> saying that some plants might have to close because of a $ 360 million shortfall in funds needed for safety improvements. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> disagreed with <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s assessment in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program Sunday, saying the necessary money had been found in unobligated funds of the department. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the issue had been resolved in the budget for the 1990 fiscal year, beginning next Oct. 1, that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9. The budget will include $ 900 million in new money for safety, environmental cleanup and building of new facilities as it relates to nuclear processing plants, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked for a supplemental appropriation of $ 360 million for the current fiscal year, `` and it was our judgment that that would be basically too little too late in the sense that we do n't have any plans for a supplemental at this point.'' `` Even if we did, it would be September or October, and therefore, what we suggested was that money be transferred out of $ 900 million in unobligated balances that exist from fiscal'89,'' he said. `` And so that will be $ 150 million that can be used immediately to begin whatever work is necessary to improve the safety conditions at these plants.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said, `` I repeat the president's statement that no plant will be operated until it's safe, and that's why we thought it was crucial to get this money on the project early, and the supplemental is not a good way to go.''

 The government is taking steps to free more than 100 Nicaraguan soldiers and civilians held prisoner in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by Nicaraguan rebels, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said the prisoners are being held by the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of forces fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said the prisoners, <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> loyalists, are being detained in camps at <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, a small town about 230 miles east of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border. The government's moves come as its support fades for Nicaraguan rebels based on Honduran territory. The rebels, known as Contras, in turn have been weakened by the cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in February. Rebel military operations have subsided. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to help release the prisoners. `` The authorities will proceed to rescue 104 of these prisoners,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday. `` The existence of such Nicaraguan Resistance camps violates our laws and sovereignty. We will continue efforts to release all the prisoners in <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> hands.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said he would risk hampering the rescue operation if he released details of it.

<TEXT>
 Rebels attacked air force headquarters on Tuesday with truck bombs and explosives lobbed by catapults, but did not penetrate the base. Two soldiers and two civilians were reported wounded. A fourth mayor in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> province resigned after receiving death threats from the leftist rebels, who accuse the officials of participating in a U.S.-backed plans against the guerrilla movement in their communities. The attack on <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> air base was the first in nearly seven years and the second this month on a major military installation in the capital. Witnesses said it began at about 10:45 a.m. with nearly simultaneous explosions of two pickup trucks parked outside the wall 150 yards apart. Military sources said the rebels lobbed homemade bombs with makeshift catapults but most exploded against the outer wall of the base in eastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Witnesses said an ice cream vendor and another civilian passer-by were wounded, and the military sources said two paratroopers were wounded inside the base. Witnesses and sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said three vehicles laden with explosives detonated outside the base, but witnesses and reporters saw the smoking wreckage of only two. A pilot at the base said: `` The security is efficient. This is the only kind of attack they can mount on us.'' A soldier told reporters: `` The guerrillas do n't have the courage to try to penetrate. They place a bomb, then run.'' Rebels set off explosives during an attack on the base in January 1982 that killed nine soldiers and destroyed 12 aircraft. An assault on National Guard headquarters on the capital's northern edge last Nov. 1 killed four guardsmen and wounded 34 people, including civilians. Homemade bombs flung by catapult are a favorite weapon of the rebels, who have fought U.S.-supported governments for nine years. An estimated 65,500 people have been killed. Mayor <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Erasmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Transito </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, told reporters he received a death threat from the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of five rebel groups. Similar letters to the mayors of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jorge </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rafael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriente </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chinameca </LOCATION> caused them to resign last week. All four belong to the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. Eight mayors have been killed since taking office after nationwide municipal elections in May. About 1,000 students rallied outside the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to protest the killing of a professor and demand that December salaries be paid to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> teachers and workers. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON>, director of the university law department, was killed Friday in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> after leading a similar protest march in the western city. No one was arrested in the killing.

 Jurors deliberated for a second day Tuesday in the murder trial of three members of a polygamist clan charged in the fatal shooting of a law officer during a raid on the group's compound. The Jan. 28 assault by officers at the rural homestead ended a 13-day standoff between authorities and members of the clan, accused in the bombing of an empty Mormon chapel. Clan patriarch <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27; his brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, and brother-in-law <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 22, are charged with second-degree murder in the death of Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, gunned down as he directed attack dogs toward the Swapp brothers during the raid. In the ensuing firefight, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> also was seriously wounded. The eight-member jury, which is being allowed by the judge to set its own schedule, spent three hours in deliberations Monday. On Tuesday, jurors put in 8 -LCB- hours more before breaking off for the night without a verdict. The siege by 100 FBI-led police officers began Jan. 16, hours after <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> bombed the chapel in nearby <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>. Both sides agree that Singer fired the fatal bullet, but Singer maintains he was firing at the dogs, not House. In addition to the second-degree murder charges, jurors were instructed they could consider convicting the three on lesser charges including manslaughter and negligent homicide. Under <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> law, the maximum penalty for second-degree murder is five years to life in prison. For manslaughter, the maximum term is zero to five years, and for negligent homicide one year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine. In connection with the case, 3rd Circuit Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> scheduled a Jan. 10 trial for <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, described by police as an acquaintance of the clan. She pleaded innocent to a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said she was on her way to the trial and asked a court clerk what to do about the small-caliber handgun she carried in her purse. The clerk told her to ask courthouse security officers, she said. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said when she did, she was detained, arrested and charged.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will negotiate with the state to reach a legally binding agreement to clean up a federally owned uranium processing plant, a spokesman said Tuesday. The decision was made late Tuesday, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON>, a spokesman for the department in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A day earlier, he had said federal officials were still considering whether the agreement should be in the form of a consent decree that would be enforceable through federal courts. News reports indicating that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was backing away from a consent decree had prompted state Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> to insist that <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> had a commitment that federal officials should honor. When state officials announced a $ 50 million federal agreement on Nov. 22 to clean up the <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> they said it could serve as a model for dealing with contamination at nuclear weapons plants around the country. <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> said the department reached its decision after discussions with <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials and consultations with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations office in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` This decision was based on the same factors that influenced our decision on two earlier consent decrees in regard to <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> litigation,'' <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> read from a prepared statement. He was referring to the announcement earlier this month of a court-approved agreement that gave <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> authority to regulate the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup of the Feed Materials Production Center, a weapons-grade uranium processing plant in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` We analyze the specific facts of each case and litigation risks involved, and the overriding consideration in all these cases was the attractive settlement proposals which were fair to both sides and made pursuing litigation unwise,'' <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> were not immediately available Tuesday night to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Earlier, <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> had expressed dissatisfaction with what seemed to be a federal reversal of its promise to negotiate toward a legally binding agreement. `` This is not atypical of the federal government. But we have a commitment from them, and we expect them to keep it,'' he said. `` I will accept nothing less than a consent decree.'' <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON> said the decision Tuesday does not mean the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will pursue similar agreements with other states that claim its nuclear facilities have polluted the environment. He also would not discuss details of any proposals put forth by the state. The <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial nuclear power reactors. It generates toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, solvents and metals, as well as radioactive materials. <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> site manager <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee, said some of the cleanup work that is included in the agreement began Dec. 1, and plans for further action have been submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which is to supervise the cleanup of about 6 million pounds of waste.

 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc's delegates narrowly approved a coalition agreement with the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> early Wednesday, another step toward formation of the next Israeli government, Israeli radio said. The agreement still needs approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,200-member central committee, which planned to meet for a vote Wednesday afternoon If Labor approves, the national unity government could be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, on Thursday. Guidelines of the new government ban talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, setting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a collision course with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The new government will be remarkably similar to the outgoing national unity government, except that Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leader, will be prime minister throughout the four-year term. In the previous term, Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the current foreign minister, was premier for the first two years. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> delegates voted in a secret ballot Tuesday night, after a stormy meeting in which opponents led by <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s former defense minister, fought a last ditch effort to overturn it Israeli radio said 796 delegates, or 55 percent, voted for the agreement, and 642 delegates, or 44.4 percent, voted against. The final tally was reported just after 3 a.m. Wednesday -LRB- 8 p.m. EST Tuesday -RRB-. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told the delegates who met in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> that Labor was an unfit partner because it favored withdrawal from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and some of its members approved of talking to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the delegates that if the party did not approve the agreement at the meeting he would go to President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> and give up the mandate he was given to form a new government. Such a move would throw <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s political system into a state of confusion. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, whose party slightly edged out Labor in Nov. 1 elections, until Dec. 26 to form a new government. Labor Cabinet ministers, meanwhile, approved the coalition pact Tuesday. The agreement will be submitted Wednesday to the party's 1,000-member central committee <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said formation of the new coalition would spell defeat for the proposed `` Who is a Jew'' legislation that was vehemently opposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews. That prospect touched off wrangling between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the four religious parties, who originally demanded the legislation and now threaten to stay out of the coalition. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> hopes to include the religious parties to make it more difficult for Labor to bring down the government should an impasse occur. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> of the Ultra-Orthodox Shas party accused <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of breaking his pledges. `` He promised us and signed an agreement to help change the Law of Return,'' he said. The Law of Return grants automatic Israeli citizenship to all Jews, and the amendment would require Orthodox approval of all conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews feel the legislation will divide the Jewish community. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> were united in standing up to the `` common danger'' _ Arab demands for creation of an independent Palestinan state. `` There is a common danger to all of us, the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. Both Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> see it as a danger, and the government will deal with it in a unified effort,'' he said. Although fear of too much influence by the religious parties had already sparked public support for another unity government, the latest agreement also was spurred by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision last week to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aides said they wanted to present a unified front against the move by their greatest ally. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters the new government guidelines mean `` there will be no negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The decision to ban talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> puts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> increasingly out of step with the rest of the international community, and could strain relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which provides $ 3 billion a year in economic and military aid to the Jewish state. Israeli officials said the new government would give top priority in the next two months to devising a peace formula that will be an acceptable alternative to dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the guidelines call for talks based on the 1978 Camp David accords which envision limited autonomy for Palestinians and the participation of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the peace process. There will be few new faces in the new government. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> will each control 10 seats in the Cabinet, which will have a total of 24 or 25 members. Key policy decisions, however, will be made by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, a close <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ally and former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> will become finance minister, a post <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> officials urged him to take in order to help debt-ridden party institutions such as the Histradrut trade union federation and the kibbutz movement of communal farms. The institutions form the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and are crucial to its support.

 A robber in a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> hat and beard snatched more than $ 700,000 from two armored car guards Tuesday in this fashionable suburb's third large heist in a little more than five years. Police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said the man, who wielded a silver-colored revolver, took two sacks of cash from <ORGANIZATION> Dunbar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> guards outside a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch shortly after 9 a.m. `` This is not a joke. Get up against the wall. Give me the bags of money,'' the robber told the guards, according to police Capt. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. No shots were fired and neither guard was injured, police said. The robber hopped into a car with an accomplice and they drove off on a nearby highway, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. Authorities suspect that the robbers tailed the armored car to the bank, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumard </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. He said the two bags held more than $ 700,000 in cash. `` Santa'' did n't have a red suit to match his hat and false beard, officials said: He was dressed in a gray trenchcoat. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the guards were engaged in `` routine'' business at the bank, but he did n't have any further information. <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, a receptionist at the armored car company, said officials would have no comment. Employees and the two or three customers inside the bank at the time were unaware the theft was taking place, said teller <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neveu </PERSON>. It was the second armored car heist in two years in the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> suburb and the third big theft since 1983. On March 4, 1987, three men stole $ 1 million in cash from a <ORGANIZATION> Loomis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> truck parked outside a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. No suspects were ever apprehended. The town's most notorious heist occurred on Sept. 12, 1983, when $ 7.1 million was taken from a <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> depot. The government contends that a security guard, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON>, pulled the robbery to help finance a Puerto Rican independence movement. Sixteen people were charged in connection with that robbery. So far, two pleaded guilty and five are on trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. Federal authorities say they think that <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosensweig </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> police detective, said that although the number of large heists in the town of 60,000 is unusual, there is no evidence they are related.

 The stepson of a newspaper executive was found guilty Tuesday of trying to murder his girlfriend after she rebuffed his marriage proposal. The shooting left her paralyzed for life. Jurors rejected <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s defense that he was crazed by drugs and intent only on suicide when he shot 23-year-old <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>, whom he had dated for nearly 10 months, as she lay sleeping in her parents' home June 8. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, 24, then turned the gun on himself, but he recovered from his wounds. The tragedy involved families who lived across the street from each other and youngsters raised in a world of wealth and privilege. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> is the stepson of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridder </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> is the daughter of a prominent orthopedic surgeon. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> showed no emotion as the verdict was read in a packed courtroom. <PERSON> Ridder </PERSON>, who sat in a front-row seat, was grim-faced as it was announced and rushed from the courtroom without comment. Jurors found <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> guilty of willful, premeditated attempted first-degree murder. They further found that he used a gun illegally and intentionally inflicted great bodily harm on Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>, who testified from a wheelchair. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he considered <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> a suicide risk and ordered him held in the hospital section of the county jail. Sentencing was set for Feb. 6. The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, said the only sentence possible on <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s attempted murder conviction is life in prison with the possibility of parole. An additional five-year sentence is possible on the two gun-related charges, he said. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> had spurned <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s marriage proposal just hours before the shooting. `` There can never be justice for me,'' Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> after learning of the verdict. `` I'm going to be in a wheelchair the rest of my life ... battling complications. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> may be out ... in 10 years.'' `` It was clearly a justified verdict,'' said Lamb. `` No matter what happens to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, his sentence to <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> was death and, failing that, he sentenced her to life in a wheelchair.'' But <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, said the verdict was decided emotionally, not on the facts. `` This was an extremely emotional jury,'' he said. `` The courtroom was charged with emotion when the ` little girl' -LRB- Miss Alban -RRB- came in to testify. They could n't focus on the facts.'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> claimed he was in a Valium-induced stupor when he shot Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> with a single bullet to the back, paralyzing her below the waist. His lawyer argued that the young man had taken 30 pills in an attempt to kill himself out of depression over a $ 30,000 gambling debt and his failure to fulfill his early promise as a tennis player. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> testified he did not remember shooting Miss <PERSON> Alban </PERSON>. She testified that she was awakened by a bullet ripping into her spine, then dragged herself to a telephone and called for help. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> told jurors that <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s precision in firing the .38 - caliber revolver showed he was not suffering from a Valium He portrayed <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> as a rejected suitor, a selfish, irresponsible man who invented the blackout defense to escape responsibility for his action.

<TEXT>
 `` Happy Birthday To You'' is not just a tune to warble on the appropriate occasions, it's a solid investment with good profit potential, says an official of the company that's buying it. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, Tuesday confirmed a report that the giant entertainment company was buying the birthday song and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> publishing company that owns it. But he would n't confirm the reported price, $ 25 million. `` This is a business deal,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` We're approaching this whole thing in that it's a very attractive deal to them and to us. If it was n't economical, we certainly would n't do it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, will pay $ 25 million for <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>. The newspaper cited an unidentified executive familiar with the negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> also confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chappell </ORGANIZATION>, which is the world's largest music publisher, was buying the family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> But, like <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, she would n't confirm the reported price tag. `` It's agreed to, but it's not closed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said. `` The song should be <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s by the end of the year.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> would not say what the return on `` Happy Birthday'' has been, but it is believed to be about $ 1 million a year. The company plans to boost revenues from the song by increasing marketing, he said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the company likes the idea of owning a classic, but he stressed that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is not buying the song for prestige or sentimental reasons. `` We think there are a lot of opportunities to further exploit the song,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` We think we can further enhance the song's royalties.'' The birthday staple and the company were put on the block in October because <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> lacked the resources to monitor and protect copyrights, said <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sengstack </PERSON>, whose family owns the company. A copyright issued on the song in 1935 expires in 2010. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> has a large operation to protect copyrights _ that is, make sure people who use the songs for profit pay royalties _ and would be able to reduce costs of protecting `` Happy Birthday'' and other <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> songs, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chappell </ORGANIZATION> already owns the rights to songs by <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, among others. Altogether, <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700 are actively collecting royalty fees. Spokesmen said that, compared with `` Happy Birthday To You,'' the other titles are obscure. The song began as a classroom greeting in 1893 penned by two schoolteacher sisters from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. The birthday lyrics were added later. Since then, it has become one of the three most frequently sung songs in the English language, along with `` <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> <PERSON> Syne </PERSON>'' and `` For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World Records. <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> also owns the <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methods </ORGANIZATION>, an instrumental instruction method for violin, cell and viola. `` Happy Birthday'' and <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> are to be only the latest of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s expanding music publishing business. Last year it spent about $ 275 million to by <ORGANIZATION> Chappell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which was privately owned.

 Anti-abortion groups, many already suspicious of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to their cause, have bombarded the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp with objections to the possible appointment of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as secretary of health and human services. A report quoting the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> educator's sentiments on abortion created a furor among conservatives, and anxiety about what one group called `` a slap in the face to the millions of anti-abortion voters.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an interview last week that if appointed he would support the president-elect's anti-abortion campaign positions, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. But concern flared anew, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> chief of the Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, when the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Constitution quoted him Sunday as saying he supported a women's right to abortion though he opposed federal funding Transition sources have said for many days that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was the front-runner for the health and human services post but that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not formally offered him the job. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was still under consideration. `` Our discussions with Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> have been ... very encouraging,'' transition team leader <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` We feel he is a very strong candidate. I think we'd like to go forward with him and I think we're pretty close to that.'' A statement from <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s group said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s appointment would be a `` slap in the face'' to conservatives and would continue `` the obstructionist tactics pro-abortion <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bown </PERSON> has employed against anti-abortionists.'' `` Generally among the various conservative and right-to-life groups in town there is confusion and thus concern about his possible appointment,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, who was former White House domestic policy adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and now heads the private <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said such an appointment would be `` politically stupid,'' because it would alienate a constituency that supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the campaign. He said his group and others have told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition officials of their `` great discomfort'' at the thought of having <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in the Cabinet. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., said abortion was the one issue about which he was `` distrustful'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before he decided to endorse the vice president's presidential candidacy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> satisfied <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> that his position was in line with the conservative stance, but <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will rue the day he picks'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life. He supports a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal, and opposes federal funding for abortion. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> echoed those positions in a Dec. 18 letter that was being circulated to conservative groups and was published in Wednesday's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. The letter said, `` I am writing to clarify my position on abortion. I am opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is threatened ... My position on abortion is entirely consistent with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> did not return reporters' calls. Transition officials denied suggestions that the Sullivan-abortion issue caused the sudden cancellation of Cabinet announcements Tuesday. Transition personnel director <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> told reporters the abortion issue is important and that `` I am confident that whoever is the nominee is certain to conform.'' The conservatives fear another secretary like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, who they say has supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-abortion views in word only. `` We need an advocate for the pre-born, not a yes man who undermines everything from behind the scenes,'' said <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s statement lining up with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions did not satisfy the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which last week wrote to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> objecting to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. The group's president, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON>, said in a statement that even though <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> may pledge to carry out the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agenda, `` only a person who shares president-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pro-life ethic and convictions can make genuinely pro-life decisions on the hundreds of day-to-day matters which can not all be referred to the president.'' Another aspect of the abortion issue that conservatives consider anathema is the use of fetal tissue for research. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as supporting that practice and saying, `` We have a number of medical advances that have occurred as a result of research with fetal tissue that have benefited the lives of many people.'' Transition spokesman <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said he did not know <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position on that issue

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides scrambled Tuesday to contain a sudden outburst over the abortion views of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> educator who is the leading contender for health and human services secretary. The president-elect did announce two other appointments _ former <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ but did so in writing and did n't face reporters' questions about <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. He canceled a session to name additional Cabinet choices. Pro-choice abortion remarks attributed to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, brought protests from anti-abortion groups and threw up an obstacle to his selection as <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition and congressional sources said. Transition officials, stressing privately that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not formally offered <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> the post, denied publicly that his remarks over the weekend in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Constitution had caused any delay in announcing new Cabinet chiefs. The officials said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> remains the top candidate for health and human services. `` Our discussions with Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> have been ... very encouraging,'' transition leader <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` We feel he is a very strong candidate. I think we'd like to go forward with him and I think we're pretty close to that.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> also told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` He's met with the vice president, he's explained his views, and Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I believe, see eye-to-eye on the question of abortion.'' In the interview, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion, while opposing the use of federal funds to pay for it. That appeared to be at odds with a statement issued last week by transition officials, after a meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, suggesting the medical school official had assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he shared the vice president's anti-abortion views. If appointed, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> would be the first black named to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself took no questions during a picture-taking session at a meeting with business leaders at which he promised anew not to raise taxes. In a statement appointing <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, a Republican, and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a Democrat, to the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised both as having `` long and distinguished careers.'' The panel, named by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the aftermath of the October 1987 stock market plunge, is striving to find a bipartisan way to eliminate the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> is a former governor of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, close friend of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, former senior Democrat on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is a longtime friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and a former college classmate at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. As for Cabinet appointments, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, said, `` There's no connection between lack of an announcement and the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> situation.'' She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had discussed abortion and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> `` indicated that if he were nominated he would support the vice president's position.'' In any event, the delay meant yet another trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> transit official <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s apparent choice for transportation secretary. To announce <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s appointment alone might have subjected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to questioning on the abortion controversy, an issue he did not want to get into while the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> appointment was still up in the air, the sources said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, was summoned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week by transition officials for an expected announcment that was then postponed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for the weekend, then was summoned back on Monday, then told by transition officials his appointment would come on Tuesday. Sources earlier said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had planned to announce <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s appointment as transportation secretary on Monday and would likely couple it with the selection of the first black in his Cabinet _ either <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a three-star retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general reportedly in line for secretary of veterans affairs The Atlanta Constitution reported Tuesday that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had said Monday evening he was having trouble getting calls to the White House returned. `` I have simply concluded that, as a result of my not receiving a call back, the things have been put off, and hopefully it's not anything worse than that.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the newspaper his pro-choice stand on abortion is a private view and he does not intend to disagree publicly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-abortion views He said he believes `` there should be that right -LRB- to abortions -RRB-. ... At the same time, I am aware of the fact that the president-elect feels that that should not be the case, and I would have to, as secretary, should I be appointed, carry out his policies.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s congressional supporters on Tuesday were circulating among anti-abortion leaders a letter in which he said, `` I am opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is threatened. ... My position on abortion is entirely consistent with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s postion.'' The letter also was published in Wednesday's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. However, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser and now heads the private <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the possibility of a Sullivan appointment had caused `` great discomfort'' among conservatives, and they have made that known to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition officials. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> referred all calls Tuesday to the vice president's office. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, the transition personnel director, asked if abortion views were a `` litmus test'' for the appointee, said, `` It's quite important. ... I am confident that whoever is the nominee is certain to conform with the president's philosophy.'' He commented at a briefing by transition officials, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration source said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to be fast emerging as the No. 1 contender for the post of labor secretary. Ms. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, has wide support among top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition officials, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to name a woman to a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post, although he has selected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> to be his chief trade negotiator _ a job that has Cabinet-level status.

 Maoist rebels cut transportation to a trickle Tuesday and shut down nearly all schools and offices in this important highland city in a general strike which they threatened to enforce with weapons. Scores of police and soldiers patrolled <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>'s nearly empty streets, but no reports emerged of violence or other guerrilla activity. It was the second so-called `` armed strike'' declared by the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in recent weeks. They paralyzed <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, their stronghold about 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, for a week in late November with a similar strike. The rebels called the three-day strike in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, on Monday. The state government was quoted as saying Tuesday's strike had no impact. <PERSON> Abilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the chief administrative officer of <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION> state, said activity was normal throughout the state, according to a dispatch by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION>. However, reporters for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other media said nearly everyone stayed indoors, apparently in fear of guerrilla reprisals. The strike came a day after <PERSON> Favio </PERSON> <PERSON> Llerena </PERSON>, deputy to <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, said dozens of small-town mayors and farming hamlet officials across the state resigned after receiving death threats by the rebel group. For two years, <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION> and the surrounding <LOCATION> Mantaro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valley, an important mining and agricultural area, have been targets of the Shining Path insurgency to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and install a Marxist state. Officials say the violence is part of the guerrillas' overall goal of weakening <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> by fomenting political and economic chaos to pave the way for the rebels to seize power. `` The <LOCATION> Mantaro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is practically taken over by the Shining Path, and there seems to be no way to defend it,'' former Industry Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arteaga </PERSON> said over the weekend. Authorities declared a state of emergency throughout <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION> a month ago as attacks increased dramatically on villages, power installations, railroads, bridges and large cooperative farms. Parts of eight states with more than half the nation's 21 million people are under emergency measures that give the military wide-ranging powers to police and govern. The capital, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, is under the regulations. The government says the Shining Path insurgency has claimed more than 12,000 lives and caused damage of more than $ 10 billion, four times the amount of the nation's yearly exports.

<HEAD>``Sally'' and ``Prince,'' Two Plays by Charles Fuller, Open
Off-Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Credit playwright <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> with setting up an ambitious project for himself _ a cycle of five plays dealing with the black experience in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the Civil War to the turn of the century. But his ambitions have gotten the best of him, at least in the first two of these historical dramas, called `` Sally'' and `` Prince,'' which arrived over the weekend at off-Broadway's <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. The plays, both set during the Civil War, are sketchy historical melodramas, long on plot and short on poetry or power. They reiterate the same themes, particularly about freedom or the lack of it for blacks, first under the slavemasters of the Old South and then under the economic overlords of the North. The plays say they traded one serfdom for another. The subject is discussed early on in `` Sally,'' which had its world premiere last summer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. Despite its title, the play deals mostly with a group of black Union soldiers who are forced to take a pay cut and earn less than their white counterparts. Some are defiant and pay the price with their lives. Others accept it and pay a different kind of penalty. One who acquiesces is <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, an ambitious black soldier who is the most interesting character in both plays. His dilemma _ to follow the Army or revel in his newly won freedom _ merits most of your attention. It is <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s survival that <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> chronicles in these two dramas, and I suspect the man will turn up in other plays in this series. You do n't need to see both of the first two dramas to understand his character, but it helps. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s persuasive, even noble, performance as <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> also helps It's a portrayal that deepens in the second play as <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> tries to deal with the dislocation and disorientation of the newly freed slaves. These intentions get sidetracked by a lot of peripheral events, directed by <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and acted by the rest of the large cast at a feverish pace. There are plenty of gunshots, a stabbing or two and some heavy-handed attempts at sexual humor. The dialogue is often flat, more concerned with recounting events than illuminating character. Consider the first play, the weaker of the two evenings of drama. Although she is the title character, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> remains the most elusive person on stage. Tragic things happen to her _ her husband is poisoned, her son is killed by rebel troops, her affair with <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> ends malevolently _ but throughout her troubles, we never get to know the woman. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shay </PERSON>, a fine actress, is stymied by the underwritten role. Another good performer, <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, has a better time of it in `` Prince,'' where she plays <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, an indominable camp follower who also manages to live _ and profit _ through the war. In `` <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>,'' the focus switches from military to civilian, the ex-slaves who have to work the cotton fields for new masters from the North. These new employers _ a church group formed to help ex-slaves _ may seem more benevolent, at first, but their rule becomes just as tyrannical. The action takes place on a gray, utilitarian setting by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McClennahan </PERSON>. It's simple but effective, allowing the fast-moving action to unfold quickly and with a minimum of fuss. In many ways, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>'s plays tackle the same themes as <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone,'' the story of ex-slaves coming to terms with their past. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s drama contains some haunting and painful but strangely beautiful images. `` Sally'' and `` Prince'' paint much more literal pictures. We'll have to wait for the next three plays to see if <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>'s vision is more fully realized.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Palestinian State May Come Within Two Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Tuesday he believes an independent Palestinian state can be established within two years in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In comments on Austrian radio, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> expressed caution when asked about creating a Palestinian government-in-exile. `` We have to think what the Israeli reaction will be,'' he said. `` Some of those people -LRB- designated members of a government-in-exile -RRB- live in the occupied territories. How would <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> treat these people? Would they arrest them, would they expel them?'' Asked when a Palestinian state could be set up, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> replied, `` We think within two years ... perhaps something less.'' At a news conference later, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed his organization's commitment to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace but vowed that the year-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will continue. `` We have definite reports that the Israeli leadership is bent on perpetrating yet more crimes and terrorist operations in order to torpedo the process of peace,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> charged. He angrily rejected any questioning of the sincerity of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> peace initiative, with leaders of his own organization threatening sabotage. `` Whatever I have said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was done on the basis of a resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as well as on the basis of a resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ which took place in a democratic atmosphere and by majority vote,'' he said. But a senior Palestinian source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> hardliners backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Tuesday to discuss ways to scuttle <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s initiative and oust him from leadership. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Zibri </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> governing body, on Monday reflected a possible serious split in top ranks by calling <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal opinion Over the weekend, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, second-in-command of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s own Fatah faction, declared, `` -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may stop his government's dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now if he thinks he will be able to stop our attacks against Israeli military targets.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is an umbrella for several Palestinian factions which often feud among themselves. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions have launched attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s approval. Other groups do not belong to the organization. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has said he can not guarantee that every Palestinian group will refrain from terrorism. He spoke before leaving <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to take his campaign for an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, apparently hoping to win support from a leading ally in the non-aligned movement. His European trip also included visits in the past week to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says he also plans to go to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The visits follow <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s recent reversal of its 13-year boycott of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. AT <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Tuesday, executive committee member <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> said indirect contacts with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government began in March when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> relayed conditions for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to meet before it would open formal talks. The two traded counterproposals for months, he said. They seemed a prelude to the intense diplomatic maneuvering through Swedish intermediaries that led to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions last week and to the first talks with the organization. <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> took part in the first meeting Friday with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, Jr. He said messages relayed through Americans of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> heritage followed the failure of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to find any notable Palestinians to speak with on a visit to Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> early this year. `` They gave signals that the American administration, after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had failed to find an alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ... was thinking in a new way ... to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> directly,'' he said.

 The jury weighing the fate of former <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> asked Tuesday to re-hear testimony by the prosecution's chief witness at the divorce-fixing conspiracy trial The panel, which got the case Monday, asked to have <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s testimony about a secret June 1986 meeting with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> read back to them as well as U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s instructions on the law governing circumstantial evidence The jurors then continued deliberating until they recessed for the night at 9:30 p.m. after about 10 hours of work. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is accused of giving a $ 19,000-a-year city job to Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> to influence her mother, a judge making interim rulings in the divorce of Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>.

In instructing the jury, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> had said that circumstantial evidence `` if believed, is of no less value than direct evidence. But in either case, the essential elements of the crimes charged must be established by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.'' All three are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and promoting bribery. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> also is charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to influence Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s grand jury testimony. According to Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, her former boss came unannounced to her apartment building in June 1986, while the grand jury was investigating her hiring. Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> told her during a nighttime walk around the block that `` you could be dangerous'' and that she should `` keep your mouth shut.''

 The problems of the homeless are so severe that drastic action including civil disobedience is sometimes necessary, activists testified Tuesday at a hearing for a colleague charged with trespassing. People are freezing to death, families are breaking down and children are being exposed to drug and alcohol addicts because society fails to take care of the homeless, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, who also heads a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> medical clinic for homeless people, was one of three witnesses who testified Tuesday at a hearing for <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who operates a shelter for homeless women and children. King took 14 women and 26 children from her shelter to a vacant house owned by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 15 in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of the homeless. When she refused an order to leave, King was arrested and charged with trespassing. The other women and children obeyed the order. King's trial was scheduled to begin Wednesday in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. Tuesday's hearing before Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sater </PERSON> was on several pre-trial motions. <PERSON> Sater </PERSON> did not rule immediately on the issues raised at the hearing, including whether he would allow King to use the so-called choice-of-evils defense. King's attorneys said they would argue that trespassing was necessary to prevent the greater evil of leaving the women and children on the streets. Since King's protest, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has rented 49 Denver-area homes to the homeless. The site of the August protest, and the other homes that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has since rented out, were obtained by the federal agency through foreclosure proceedings when buyers who used federally backed mortgages defaulted. <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> testified Tuesday that families make up a growing percentage of the homeless people in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area. `` On any given night, there are 500 children in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> who are homeless,'' she said. She also said a recent study found 1,100 shelter beds in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area, and roughly 2,100 to 2,600 people competing for them. Last week, she said, two homeless men were brutally murdered, and people have frozen to death on <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s streets. She said it is justified to occupy a home illegally because `` civil disobedience is a form of public education.'' Another witness, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, who has been homeless since May, tearfully told the court how she and her three grandchildren lived in a park last summer. She said she slept during the day so she could stay awake at night, watching over the children, age 3, 4 and 8. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> said a recent study in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> showed children are suffering because of a lack of attention to the problem of homeless families. `` We're seeing a lot of anxiety, clinging behavior in kids, arguments, school disruption, sleep disturbance, eating disturbance, and a lot of anxiety and depression in parents because they're unable to care for their children,'' she said

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday threw out the convictions of a habitual offender who was sentenced to 32 years in prison after he tried to get a refund for an electric razor without a receipt. The court, in a 4-1 decision, struck down the attempted theft and habitual criminal convictions of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and ordered <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> discharged from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> State Prison. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 49, was sentenced to two years in prison in 1985 for attempting to get a refund for a $ 42.96 Remington razor at three <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> stores. Under the state's habitual offender law, a fixed term of 30 years was added to the sentence because of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s earlier convictions on auto banditry and drug charges Prosecutors argued at his <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> attempted `` to exert unauthorized control'' over one store's profit margin by creating the false impression he had purchased the razor there. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> concluded that in order to prove <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was trying to create a false impression, the state needed to prove <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had n't purchased the razor at the store. There was no evidence to demonstrate where the razor was purchased, the court said. `` Without that crucial element of proof, every citizen engaging in a simple refund transaction would risk criminal penalties,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> wrote for the court. `` Some citizens such as those seeking to return gifts simply do not know where the item was originally purchased.'' Court records show that in November 1978, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> took the razor to a Hook's Drug store in <LOCATION> Mooresville </LOCATION> and later to a Hook's in <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION> to get a refund. The package had a Hook's price tag on it, but employees refused to give <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> a refund because of a store policy requiring receipts for returned merchandise. He then went to a <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>'s store in <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION> and presented the razor, without a price tag, for a refund. Hook's employees, suspicious about <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s behavior, had alerted <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>'s employees of his earlier attempts to get a refund. Employees at the <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>'s store called police when <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> showed up and stalled until police arrived to arrest <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, court records show. <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>'s also would have denied a refund under its no-receipt, no-refund policy. The long gap between his arrest and final sentencing occurred because <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> left the courtroom during his trial and remained at large for four years, according to court records.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will continue efforts to negotiate a formal end to their World War II hostilities, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Wednesday, a day after territorial talks broke down. Japanese officials indicated that all hope of a compromise vanished in Tuesday's negotiations about the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claims. Soviet troops occupied them in the last days of World War II, and they have remained the major roadblock to an official end to hostilities. However, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Wednesday the two sides will pick up where they left off in 1973 to negotiate a peace treaty officially ending the war. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, speaking to a news conference shortly before departing for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, said his talks with Japanese leaders had brought a `` very important'' agreement on a mechanism and rough schedule of meetings to deal with thorny issues now over four decades old. The Soviet official gave a more positive assessment of his two days of talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno than Japanese officials gave the night before. One Japanese official described the talks as `` heated'' and said neither side had changed its position on the territorial dispute. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was to give a news conference later Wednesday after <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s departure and a joint communique was to be released then. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> agreed that no major progress was achieved. But he cited progress in agreements on further meetings leading to a possible summit between Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. He also said the negotiations had won `` a victory for reason, for balance of interests, and for a realistic policy.'' `` We have obtained a degree of mutual understanding that allows us to speak of a new chapter in Japan-Soviet relations,'' he said, speaking in Russian that was translated into English. The <PERSON> Kiril </PERSON> dispute has also blocked progress in diplomatic and economic matters between the two countries. On Tuesday, the Japanese brushed off Soviet overtures for economic cooperation, the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The talks in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were the first between foreign ministers in nearly three years. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON> said little progress was achieved in the discussions, which he described as heated. `` Neither side has shown concessions, so the positions are still far apart,'' he said. Also Tuesday, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> refused to conclude two agreements, one on bilateral investment guarantees and another on trade and economic cooperation, the agency said, quoting government sources it did not name. The ministers signed agreements on cultural exchanges and protection of 287 species of migratory birds. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> delivered a letter from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and said he would like to visit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Wednesday the tentative agenda for a Japan-Soviet summit would include agreements to protect investment, principles of economic cooperation and establishment of banking offices, as well as treaty issues and other matters. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had established trade and other unofficial relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but would not establish governmental relations with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The Soviets are <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s ally, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s growing ties with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> have tended to further isolate <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> The Soviet foreign minister left for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, from where he is scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 The army chief and his two top ranking generals resigned Tuesday following opposition charges that the army commander made a deal with military rebels to end their four-day revolt this month. The resignations appeared to be concessions to the mutineers and pose military and political problems for President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> as his party campaigns for May 14 presidential elections. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> made no immediate public comment, but was expected to accept the resignations of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON>, the army commander, and <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> for 1 -LCB- hours before announcing his decision, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> TELAM </ORGANIZATION> said in a terse statement on the resignations. It gave no reasons or details for the resignations. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is to address the Argentine <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday in a special session focusing the Dec. 1-4 military insurrection, the third uprising in 20 months. Rebels led by army Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> demanded all the top generals go, an increased military budget including bigger pay packets, and an end to the prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 military regime. On Dec. 3, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> ordered the army to `` suffocate'' the rebellion. The next day, he announced the mutineers surrendered unconditionally. But political opponents noted at the time that loyal troops were reluctant to fight the rebels, that the rebels were not immediately disarmed and that most mutineers were allowed to return to their units. The opposition accused <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> or <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> of cutting a deal with the rebels. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> denied making any deal. Nevertheless, a 20 percent pay increase was granted to soldiers along with a $ 100 bonus. On Saturday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> said in a speech that the so-called `` dirty war'' against leftist subversion in the late 1970s was necessary _ effectively endorsing the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s position and infuriating human rights groups. While the army did fight pitched battles with <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, the `` dirty war'' takes its name from the arrests, disappearances and presumed killings of several thousand civilians alleged to be subversives <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> was <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s fourth army chief in five years. His predecessor, Gen. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> <PERSON> Erenu </PERSON>, departed after the first insurrection in April 1987, which also was sparked by the human rights trials. The selection of <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON>'s successor is delicate. Choosing an open supporter of <LOCATION> Seineldin </LOCATION>, the rebel leader, would damage <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s credibility and the civilian government's claim that the military is subordinate to it Already, presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said he would have fired <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> for making a deal with the rebels. <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> may have paved the way for his departure by saying in a television interview last Friday that the insurrection ended when he and <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> spoke and `` realized that our aspirations coincided.'' `` And so the question: why confront one another to produce bloodshed if what they -LRB- rebels -RRB- were asking, the army was trying to achieve,'' <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> said. He added that if rebels' demands were not met, there might soon be a fourth insurrection. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s two main political parties repeatedly have said they would not allow <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass amnesty legislation to halt the human rights trials, which are about to resume in civilian court after a year's lapse.

 Every once in a while, some brave soul ventures forth to demand: `` Get rid of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>!'' A chorus of protests inevitably results in various quarters, religious and otherwise. It has happened again. This time, the Santa-smashing thrust comes from a minister in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` Santa Claus should be abolished from the celebration of Christmas,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Girard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` He should be discarded with last year's gift wrappings.'' After all, it's not his birthday, but that of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says, yet `` it is always <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> who receives the most attention during the Christmas season. `` His face and portly figure appear on the majority of holiday decorations and greetings.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> hoists his challenge in The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> Reporter, a national denominational weekly published in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, declaring that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> has virtually `` become a god!'' Anything `` that takes the place of God is an idol,'' he adds, suggesting that's the kind of false substitute being worshipped at Christmas. Furthermore, he says it engenders some shoddy impulses in the young, both selfishness for things and eventual disillusionment that the whole affair is unreal, a fantasy perpetrated by adults. `` Santa Claus inspires greed,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says. `` We all have seen little children pushing and shoving in line preparing to tell <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> what they want ... `` I have witnessed the sanctuary of a church turn into a madhouse because of the arrival of the man in the red suit as children and adults wait for their names to be called to receive their gifts.'' Besides that, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> myth is `` cloaked in untruths,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> points out, and the child eventually learns `` it was all a fake.. `` There should be no dishonesty associated with such a beautiful holiday. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> came to be the truth. Such a lovely story does not need to be surrounded by untruths.'' The argument sometimes is made that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> is proper for the occasion because children need something `` they can see,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> notes. He says this is the same explanation given <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> when he descended from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> with the Ten Commandments and found the Israelites worshipping the golden calf, viz.: `` The people wanted something they could see.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> adds, `` The argument that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> is the ` spirit of love' leads me to ask, ` Then where does that leave <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>? Is n't he the spirit of love?''' As for reactions from <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s congregation when he once `` put my foot down'' and ordered <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> eliminated, he says it was the adults, not the children, who complained. `` Children love the thought of the baby in the manger and they, with wide-eyued innocence, love to worship him,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> adds. `` They do n't need something to take his place.'' Nevertheless, efforts to oust <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> almost always have produced resistance and repercussions, as was the case in the 1986 season when a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, told a children's class <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> did n't exist. When asked by a fifth-grader at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vianney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, if that meant parents were liars, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said yes, a parent reported. The episode brought apologies from <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s church superiors, saying: His `` zeal to emphasize the spiritual dimensions'' of the occasion unfortunately `` appeared to diminish the importance that many, especially children, attach to some of the cultural and secular aspects.'' It's a touchy issue, with some church leaders deploring the extent to which <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> diverts attention from <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, while others defend the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> myth, so long the main emphasis is on <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>'s birth. In any case, old and young generally treat <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> as a charming fellow and lot of fun, immune to stuffy analysis. Counter to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s call for ouster of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, writes in an earlier issue of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> Reporter: `` I'm beginning to wonder if <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> is really as far from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> as we make it ... If he -LRB- <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> -RRB- were made for children, he was born in the mind of adults, in the spirit, the yearning, the brokenness, the hopes of adults. `` He is, in all of this commercial, earthy, secular, materialistic and often corny glory, something of a prayer in disguise ... `` He is our yearning and our question, the question of Christmas _ ` Is there anyone there beyond ourselves? And if you are there, do you really care?' As Christians ... we profess to have heard God's answer ... `` We claim it We retell it, the story that <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is born, and born again.'' The light of that story can reach into the silent darkness of others' yearnings and suffering, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> says, perhaps heard in the words, `` Yes, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> ... there is a God.''

 Christmas services provide an opportunity to draw alienated Catholics back into regular worship, but priests tend to `` ridicule and demean'' them for attending so infrequently, says the Rev. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON>. Writing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholic, published by the Claretian Fathers, the noted priest-sociologist-novelist says: `` One of the more twisted and sick kinks in clerical culture is the propensity to ridicule and demean the ` Christmas Catholics' and, even when priests are on their best behavior, to patronize them.'' <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON> says `` Christmas Catholics,'' who show up only on such holidays, often are alienated from the church, having been hurt or confused by it, and they `` need to know there's room for them in the inn, too.'' He adds, `` Welcoming the alienated and inviting them to come home and stay home permanently is surely far more in the spirit of Christmas than brutalizing them again.''

Eventually, the film veers off into a standard-issue plotline about a tumor and <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s big show-down with <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> on the 18th hole of the U.S. Open. But if the story is predictable, it's also satisfying, because <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' characters are immensely likable, and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s direction is, like <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s play _ for those brief shining moments just dead solid perfect.

 Elsewhere in television: BOUNCING ` BABY BOOM' _ Just when `` Baby Boom'' started turning into a pretty decent little show about upscale working women, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> announced the series was going on hiatus. `` Baby Boom'' will remain in production, but is leaving the schedule until further notice. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did like the new shows `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' `` Empty Nest,'' `` Day by Day,'' `` In the Heat of the Night'' and `` Midnight Caller'' enough, however, to give them full-season orders. A decision about the fate of low-rated `` Tattinger's'' is expected soon. The show has had trouble finding a niche, but it will no doubt get another chance, since it is made by the producers of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s critically acclaimed ex-series `` St. Elsewhere.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the network and producers are considering options that include shortening `` Tattinger's'' from an hour to a half-hour. ...

 Deep in the basement of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION> a seal named Goofy lounges in his private tank, taking a casual glance at observers before rolling belly-up, inches below the water's surface Outside, in nippy 30-degree temperatures, 3 -LCB- - year-old <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> darts about his pool, twirling splashy pirouettes and barking `` Hi'' in return for a steady supply of fish <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> and Goofy enjoy safe harbor at the aquarium, just two of the sick, orphaned or stranded animals taken in under a marine mammal rescue program that began 15 years ago. `` In terms of a job, it's a real satisfying sort of thing,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, the program's supervisor. Goofy was picked up on a <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION> beach this fall. <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> was an orphan found in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> about two years ago. He was released once but did n't take to the wild. `` He was a young orphan pup raised on seal formula and weaned on to fish. He was released up in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and about a day or two later he showed up on a beach,'' Early said. Volunteers recall how <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON>, identified by tags, crawled onto a beach blanket in the middle of a crowd and, when placed on the front floorboards of a truck, climbed up onto the seat and went to sleep. `` We brought him back in and said it seems like <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> wants to stay here,'' Early said. This year, the aquarium has picked up more than 150 animals, Early said, many sick or injured and most of them already dead. Seals are the most common animals rescued, but from October to January the focus is on whales, which often strand themselves on Cape Cod beaches. The aquarium now has four residents of the program: a sea turtle chewed up by a shark and three seals. About 50 percent of the seals found survive and are returned to the wild or sent to zoos, Early said. Harbor seals, which grow to about 5 feet and can weigh 220 pounds, usually keep to secluded beaches, rocky reefs and mud flats. Since they spend part of their time on land, they do n't really get stranded, but when they're ill they often stay out of the water for unusually long periods. Goofy, who appears satisfied to stay in his pool and be fed more than 15 pounds of food a day, is a likely zoo candidate because he seems to lack the fortitude to survive in the wild, Early said. When he was picked up, `` he was very, very docile which for a harbor seal is not normal,'' Early said. <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON>, named after the brightest star in the constellation of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, is working on an appropriately stellar career at the aquarium's seal pool. Many male seals vocalize, particularly around mating season, but <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> can bark a creditable `` Hi'' on command and splashes around the pool to show off to passers-by. `` We're working on teaching <PERSON> Rigel </PERSON> hello,'' said <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montague </PERSON>, supervisor of seal training. `` He is actually kind of a ham.''

<HEAD>Rockettes Fall Down in Style During `The Parade of the Wooden
Soldiers'</HEAD>

 The hard part of falling down is getting up. <PERSON> Violet </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> should know. She's the woman who supervises the domino-like descent of 36 <ORGANIZATION> Rockettes </ORGANIZATION> in `` The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,'' one of the most popular production numbers at Radio City Music Hall's annual Christmas show. `` It's very difficult,'' says <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a former Rockette who now directs the high-kicking dance line at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s famous art deco entertainment palace. `` You ca n't just bend and get yourself up in stiff, starched pants. The girls turn around and help each other up.'' The five-minute dance is a precision military march done by the <ORGANIZATION> Rockettes </ORGANIZATION> dressed as toy wooden soldiers. It ends with a cannon shot _ a puff of smoke that knocks over the line of dancers. They fall, one by one, on top of each other. And the audience cheers. `` The fall has to be done just right,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> says. `` You have to hold the girl in front of you, bringing her to you. As she falls back, you have to fall back to the girl behind you. You have to make sure your legs are straight and that your arms are open, so that the girl behind you, catches you. If they do n't, the whole thing will slide right down.'' The march was choreographed originally by <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Rockettes </ORGANIZATION> in 1932 when <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> opened. <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> had formed other high-kicking, precision kick lines. He started with the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockets </ORGANIZATION> in 1925, moved them to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a part in the 1928 musical hit `` Rain or Shine,'' and then to the Roxy Theater where they were know as the Roxyettes. It was at the Roxy that <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> first choreographed `` The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers.'' Radio City beckoned four years later, and the line, with the name <ORGANIZATION> Rockettes </ORGANIZATION>, has been there ever since. So have those wooden soldiers, with <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> supervising the march every year. It's one of the highlights of the Christmas show which will be on view through Jan. 4. How do you teach someone to fall? `` Slooow-ly,'' says <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. She usually begins by teaching it in sections of 10 or 12 dancers lined up in a row. The others watch, and they all get pointers from dancers who have done the number before. `` A march of any kind is very difficult to teach,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> says. `` The lines have to be perfect because it's so obvious if one girl sticks out. It's the guiding and keeping straight lines and walking with straight knees, not bent knees, in stiff, starched pants.'' Sometimes, the line has dancers who think that if they hold the fall a little bit, it's going to help the weight,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> adds. It does n't. If the fall starts and the line is crooked, there's nothing a dancer can do to correct it. `` It's like you're in midair,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> says. There have been injuries over the years, although none serious, the director says. `` If properly done, the number is not dangerous,'' she adds. The first girl who falls has the easiest job. It's the last dancer who has it tough, even though she collapses on a big, fat pillow. `` She's waiting and looking at these 36 girls coming at her,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> says. `` That's frightening. And you do n't know how fast the fall is going to come. It can come very easily or like a whip.'' The fall is supposed to go easily, smoothly and slowly. `` You are not supposed to look out and down because that would throw the line crooked. They should only look at the girl's head right in front of them,'' she says. `` So you anticipate, but you do n't know what you're anticipating because you ca n't see anything.'' The parade has been modified slightly over the years. At some Christmas shows, the soldiers came down a ramp from a castle or out of sentry boxes. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Rockettes </ORGANIZATION> just march out from the wings of the large stage. Still, what audiences see at Radio City is much of the original version, according to <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, although she has cut it by two minutes to fit more smoothly into the Hall's current 90-minute Christmas extravaganza. The director has her own charts and notes to guide her through the restaging. But she does n't need them. `` After all these years, you know it by heart,'' she says. `` You do n't have to consult your notes anymore. Besides, I've tried to keep it the same. Why change anything that is so successful?''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, implanted in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as the voice of the workers and the poor by <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> four decades ago, is in a resurgence it hopes will bring victory in presidential elections set for May. It has been out of power for 12 years. Virtually every poll gives <PERSON> Peronist </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, a colorful provincial governor, a commanding lead over the candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>. Provincial and congressional elections last year reversed <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> setbacks in 1983, when civilian government was restored after nearly eight years of military dictatorship during which <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> politicians, including <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, were jailed, <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> teachers were dismissed from universities and labor leaders were arrested and executed. In September 1987, Peronist candidates swept 17 of the country's 22 provinces, including <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, the biggest The party's inroads in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> eliminated the Radical's majority `` In 1983, it was n't <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> against <PERSON> Luder </PERSON>, it was the Radicals against the <ORGANIZATION> Peronists </ORGANIZATION>,'' losing candidate <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> Argentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Luder </PERSON> said in an interview, referring to <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> swamped <PERSON> Luder </PERSON>, 52 percent to 40 in the balloting for president in post-military <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` Now, it is totally different,'' the 71-year-old <PERSON> Luder </PERSON> said. `` The economy is the biggest theme _ inflation, foreign debt, growth, employment, purchasing power ... -LRB- and -RRB- the Radicals have totally failed in government.'' Pollster <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> y <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>'s surveys consistently give <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> twice as big a share of the vote as <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, though he notes that undecideds have crept up to 35 percent. `` You ca n't say -LRB- <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s -RRB- victory is beyond doubt, but he's definitely ahead,'' the pollster said <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> founded the party following his victory in the elections of 1946, the most honest and widely attended in two decades. An army colonel at the time, <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> later was promoted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to general. With his wildly popular and politically astute wife <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> at his side and sometimes acting on her own, <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> won the support of workers disenfranchised by previous conservative governments. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> industrialized an agricultural economy based on grain and beef, nationalized industries, promoted such legislation as collective bargaining and pensions, vastly extended public education and health services, and gave women the right to vote. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> established a dictatorship that remained popular so long as <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> _ </PERSON> <PERSON> Evita </PERSON>, as she was affectionately known _ was around. Popular support began to diminish after her death of cancer in 1952 and with the economy in trouble in 1955 the military overthrew <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> and sent him into exile in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. He made a triumphal return in 1971 and was elected president again in 1973, with his new wife, <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON>, as his vice president. She took the presidency upon <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s death in 1974 only to be ousted by the military two years later. While the <ORGANIZATION> Perons </ORGANIZATION> themselves have had their ups and downs, the party has generally maintained its base of organized labor and the poor. The 4-million-member General Workers Confederation, the chief labor union, `` was born, is and will always be Peronist,'' the 53-year-old <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told a recent rally. But party leaders now are trying to appeal to the middle class, which they see as key to the 50 percent of the vote required by Argentine law to win the election outright and avoid a runoff in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Luder </PERSON>, an attorney who is one of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s advisers, says appealing to the middle class is a natural move. `` Peronism created this country as we know it today,'' he said. `` The sons and grandsons of the workers of 1946 today are businessmen, teachers, professionals.'' Argentines in those stations, however, tend to support the <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> or the conservative Union of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON>, a former economy minister and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. Today's Peronists are finding their overtures frustrated by the party's image of violence, demagoguery and administrative incompetence, a public perception <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> calls his party's `` black legend.'' Even triple-digit inflation, rising unemployment, stagnant growth and three military insurrections under President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> can not shake the recollections of better-off Argentines that some of the country's economic and political low points occurred under <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> governments. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> squandered huge gold reserves built up during World War II, crowded out private business by expanding the state's role in the economy, made public employment conditional on party membership, tolerated corruption and thuggery against his opponents, closed down newspapers, antagonized the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. In the final months before <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> was ousted by the military in 1976, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was torn by murderous street violence, out-of-control inflation and paralyzing strikes. `` Peronist governments have never understood economics,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Balassoni </PERSON>, a medical products importer. `` It's very possible he -LRB- <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> -RRB- would return control to the unions, so the unions would govern, not the government.'' A well-dressed, middle-aged woman at a rally for <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> in a downtown sports stadium said, `` If <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> wins, the country will slide backwards, despite his best intentions. ... I favor shrinking the size of the state, selling state companies. The Peronists would never sell state companies.'' National elections set for May 14 may hang in the balance of opinions like theirs. Votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> are tied to the popular ballot. If <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> fails to win at least 50 percent, <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> could determine the election by throwing his support to <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> at times seems to hurt his own cause by endorsing ideas that appear contradictory and are never fully explained. Although <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is a country notorious for tax evasion, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has said he would curtail the fiscal deficit not by cutting back state employment or selling off money-losing state enterprises, but by cutting tax rates in the hope that would spur compliance and generate additional revenue. Under his program, workers would receive big wage increases, but he has not fully explained where the money would come from. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s allies do n't always help. While he tries to project an image of moderation and statesmanship, Mrs. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in November dredged up unhappy memories by endorsing an amnesty for the former military chiefs who directed the so-called `` dirty war'' against subversives and the leftist Montonero urban guerrillas in the 1970s. At least 8,900 Argentines were arrested and `` disappeared'' during that campaign. Forced to take a position on that sensitive issue, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said he opposed an amnesty. In another case, the leader of a leftist <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> splinter group, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Unamuno </PERSON>, publicly stated that <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> would pardon <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmenich </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Montonero </LOCATION> leader who is in prison for murder, extortion and kidnapping. An angry <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> denied he planned any such pardon and suspended Unamuno from the party. The Radicals have seized upon such rifts and gaffes to fan passions and fears that are never far from the surface in this politically polarized country. `` Violence is part of their history,'' said <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> still has violent elements in its structure.''

<HEAD>Salinas Starts Furor Over Church-State Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has kicked a political hornet's nest by suggesting the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, technically illegal in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1917, be restored to normal status. The constitution ratified in that year by the triumphant forces of the Mexican revolution went beyond separation of church and state. It denied the church legal existence and tried to eliminate church influence. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> remains the most Catholic country in the hemisphere nonetheless, and the church has not faded. Every year, millions of people take part in public processions to the Basilica of the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, the country's patron saint. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> acknowledged reality by declaring in his inaugural speech Dec. 1 that a `` modern state deals openly and modernizes its relationship with unions, business groups, news organizations ... and the church.'' It was the first time in modern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a president publicly acknowledged the church as part of society. Sitting in the gallery for the first time were representatives of the church: Cardinal <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Corripio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahumada </PERSON>, four other bishops and Papal Nuncio <PERSON> Girolamo </PERSON> <PERSON> Prigione </PERSON>, the pope's ambassador. Church leaders welcomed the move and conservative parties said they favored a debate to redefine the church's role. Critics said the government should stick to the constitution. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has controlled the government since it was founded 60 years ago, was torn between supporting him and loyalty to the constitution's framers. Congresswoman <PERSON> Socorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said: `` The reopening of a debate settled by history ... does not strengthen national unity and creates disagreement and confrontation among Mexicans.'' She is director of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dia </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper sponsored by the party's left wing. Some saw the president's move as an effort to widen support for his government while his party is losing traditional backing from labor and the middle class. The issue does divide the opposition. During a debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, conservatives shouted `` Fanatic!'' `` Robespierre!'' and `` Son of Lenin!'' at left-wing members who opposed the reassessment. An officially anti-clerical government leading a largely Catholic population is one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s contradictions. The government ignores technical violations of the law by the church in order to maintain social peace. One paragraph in Article 130 of the constitution says: `` The law does not recognize the religious associations known as churches.'' In the eyes of the peasant, union and military revolutionaries who wrote it, the church was part of an oppressive landowning establishment. To the hierarchy, they were godless destroyers of established order. Churches can not own property and the government has the power to determine the number of priests in each state. Foreign priests are prohibited from working in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and public displays of religion are forbidden. Priests do not have the right to vote, but do so. They are not allowed to speak or write about politics or the government, but write opinion columns. They are barred from teaching, but the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> runs schools and universities where the children of government leaders study. Presidents hold private meetings with bishops. Two million people attended a Mass in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> conducted by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. He spent a week in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> during his first trip to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In the late 1920s, <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> conducted the Cristero revolt because of government persecution. A church hero was the Rev. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pro </PERSON>, a Jesuit priest executed by the government, who was beatified in November. A few days after the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> inaugural, Interior Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> caused front-page headlines by declaring: `` The church exists,'' and since then the debate has covered acres of newsprint. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said even the presence of prelates at the inauguration had violated the Mexican constitution. He demanded an investigation. A leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, said change is needed because the current situation `` stimulates fanaticism.'' The Popular and Unified Socialist parties both belong to the Democratic Front coalition that supported <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> against <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> in the July 6 presidential election. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> should be able to get the two-thirds vote he needs in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to change the constitution, if he wants to do so. His party controls 60 of 64 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, and although it has only 260 of 500 lower house seats it can expect support from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 101 members.

<TEXT>
 Patients at <PERSON> Inge </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON>'s clinic for torture victims say their injuries often were inflicted in the presence of doctors, nurses or psychologists _ people trained to heal. The Danish physician said it has become clear during six years of treating battered refugees and studying torture cases that medical personnel nearly always were involved, even if only giving tacit assent. In a well-documented case in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, a prison psychologist advised torturers on how to break victims. Studies by the clinic indicate up to 25,000 people in the medical profession are involved. `` Torture could not take place to the extent it does today if doctors were not implicated,'' the doctor said. `` These doctors should be thrown out of medical organizations, and not only in their own country.'' Dr. <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON> is director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Torture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION>. It treats victims, publishes educational material, trains doctors and psychologists in the care of victims and conducts courses for police and others who deal with refugees. It is private and independent, financed by the government and private donations. Her study of torture started 15 years ago, when Dr. <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON> was in a group of physicians asked by the <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> to examine victims for evidence of torture. She opened the center in 1982 in a wing of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> and has helped establish similar facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and elsewhere. The <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> clinic has a staff of 30 doctors, psychologists and others who treat 70-100 victims and families every year. The 1988 Right Livelihood Award was given to Dr. <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakob </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Uexkull </PERSON> established the prize in 1980 for humanitarian work. Estimates by the center indicate 30 percent of the approximately 24,000 people given asylum in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> have been exposed to torture. `` We used to believe that medical personnel participating in torture was a rare phenomenon, but now we know that almost all torture victims have been in contact with them in the actual torture process,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesti </PERSON>, a staff psychiatrist. `` Today we know the purpose of torture is not to get information, but to destroy the personality and spread terror to control the population.'' In 1986, the center broadened its scope to include research and documentation on torture, in cooperation with doctors in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. An international committee has been formed to expose illegal practices and revoke licenses of doctors involved with torture. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has estimated torture is practiced in at least 90 countries. `` In <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the medical associations have been extremely brave and courageous,'' Dr. <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON> said. Several hundred military doctors are believed involved in torture in each of those countries, the center has reported. Dr. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, former director of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s medical association, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> four doctors had been expelled and two suspended from membership. `` They are a really astounding example of how national medical associations can deal with this issue,'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> of the American Association for the Advancement of Science said in a telephone interview. `` Not only have they disciplined physicians while the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government is in power, they have adopted a set of guidelines for physicians.'' <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s was a unique case of a medical association acting against doctors involved in torture while a military government remained in power. In <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, where democracy was restored in 1985, the ethics board of the physicians' union imposed sanctions on four doctors, including <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiz </PERSON>, found to have issued a death certificate in 1984 that concealed evidence of torture. All four continue practicing medicine in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, however. About 200 doctors have given depositions about their activities under the military dictatorship that began in 1973, but action has been taken only against <PERSON> Saiz </PERSON> and the other three. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> last March, the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> revoked the license of <PERSON> Amilcar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobo </PERSON>, an army doctor who attended torture sessions in 1970-1974. Brazilian press reports say <PERSON> Lobo </PERSON> has implicated other doctors but no formal charges have resulted. <PERSON> Emilie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was investigating charges in that country. Dr. <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON> said the involvement of medical people in torture can take many forms: `` For example, a doctor can examine a prisoner and conclude that he or she has a weak heart and should not have electrical torture, because they are not supposed to die.'' She also said psychological torture, often involving threats, can be worse than physical punishment. Her center has done extensive research on torture methods in order to develop the most effective medical and psychological care for victims. Most are treated as outpatients. Treatment at the center combines physiotherapy, psychotheraphy and social counseling. It usually lasts 10 to 12 months. The clinic decor is cheerful and the atmosphere friendly. Beige and yellow furniture and flowered textiles are used to reduce the resemblance to a medical institution. Patients report such tortures as hanging by hands or elbows, sometimes for days; electric shocks; beatings, amd holding the head under filthy water. Long afterward, patients often have such symptoms as sexual disturbance, hallucinations, fear, confusion, nightmares and loss of self-confidence and self-respect, <PERSON> Vesti </PERSON> said. As Dr. <PERSON> Genefke </PERSON> explained it: `` There is so much fear, anger, aggressions, shame and guilt that has to be expressed, and it is very, very difficult. We do n't call our patients torture victims, we call them torture survivors.''

 Almost from the minute he takes the presidential oath Jan. 20, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will face a raft of fast-developing foreign policy issues in a world that has changed radically from the one <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> found eight years before. Most immediately pressing, perhaps, is the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be on the verge of its first major involvement in a peace effort since <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s shuttle diplomacy of the 1970s. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s changing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and more U.S.-Soviet arms agreements also are likely items on the agenda for the early days of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. Then there is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and its new contacts with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the East is at a crossroads, and the West looks with less trepidation toward the Soviet bloc; <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with its debt and economic stagnation; <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where South African apartheid remains a troublesome and delicate issue for the White House; and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where burgeoning economies still pour goods into Main Street, U.S.A. Even the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the place people dream of for tranquil escape, has become a piece in the world chess game. Each year at this time, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> asks its correspondents in strategic areas of the world to look ahead to what Americans can expect abroad in the new year. For 1989, they were asked to look ahead to what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can expect in his first year in office. These are their reports:

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inherits a rapidly changing climate in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> holds the seeds of a possible breakthrough in settling the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict.

That could improve the prospects of freeing Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most of the 16 foreigners, including nine Americans, are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists.

 In less than four years, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has painted over the image of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a boastful, missile-wielding totalitarian state with a portrait of a hopeful giant struggling to pull itself up by the bootstraps and join the community of peaceful nations. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still has those missiles, and if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to continue a period of easing world tensions, he must find some way to break the deadlock that prevented his predecessor from signing an agreement with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to slash strategic arsenals in half. The initial roadblock remains President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' program to develop a space-based defense against missile attack. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> insists such a program only opens a new, dangerous arena for the arms race and makes reductions in offensive weapons impossible. Beyond that lie unresolved questions about how the two sides can fairly balance reductions in their inherently different land, sea and air weapons systems. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is busy not only trying to restructure the economy and way of thinking in his own country, but he also is trying to break down East-West barriers and develop new trade relationships throughout the world. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has moved more slowly than some nations in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to encourage an end to Soviet isolation and support development of a potentially powerful new Soviet market. Some Westerners have suggested the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s efforts to improve relations, particularly with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, could weaken <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties to its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> works to build what he calls a `` common European home.''

 In <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces a delicate balancing act between Communist authorities opening up to reform and the increasingly vocal and active independent groups who want the West to insist on more human rights. As in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Communist governments in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> are realizing they must open up to economic and perhaps political reform in order to modernize outmoded industry and keep consumer demands satisfied. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, for the time being, have rejected any need for the change their allies have embraced with varying degrees of enthusiasm. But new laws allowing more private and foreign investment in East bloc economies will not boost output unless the West agrees to make large loans and import or sell its advanced technology. Some West European leaders have talked of a kind of `` Marshall Plan'' to help out <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where massive investment would be needed to provide modern housing and industry and clean up the heavily polluted environment. But independent groups encouraged by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are also placing increasing demands for genuine democracy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> traditionally has been small.

 A fresh push will likely be made to wrap up negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reducing long-range nuclear weapons. In December, 1987, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty which provides for eliminating all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to hold their first summit in 30 years by mid-1989, ending a rift that drastically reshaped the strategic thinking of the world powers. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration stressed it welcomed the easing of tensions between the two giants and expressed faith in Chinese assertions they will never return to the relationship of the 1950s when <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was a subservient ally of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, will need to take a new look at how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> figures in American strategic interests when <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> formally makes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card'' obsolete. U.S.-Chinese relations based on shared antipathy to Soviet policies have long been overshadowed by more substantially binding ties. Total trade for 1988 is expected to reach $ 12 billion and continues to grow. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses have invested $ 3 billion in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization drive. Scientific, military and cultural exchanges are everyday occurrences, and thousands of Chinese study at American universities and research centers.

 Marked by wars, deep economic problems and social and political instability, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> poses new foreign policy questions for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration in 1989. The president will have to decide if he will continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's funding for the Contra rebels in their attempt to oust the almost 10-year-old leftist Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, shortly after his election, indicated he might take a more diplomatic approach with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The majority of the Contras, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981, moved into base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1988 to receive U.S.-supplied goods ranging from food to uniforms. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to get the rebels out.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s crushing foreign debt and a firmly entrenched cocaine industry will pose tough challenges for the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration in 1989 and years go come.

Shackled by huge debt obligations, their governments are looking north for reduced interest rates and other forms of financial relief.

Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the new administration will have to wrestle with a budgetary dilemma _ can it meet its deficit-cutting priorities at home and still make an acceptable aid contribution to a continent with staggering development needs? The Soviet bloc seems to have abandoned expansionist policies on the continent, and left-leaning governments in countries such as <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> seem more willing than ever to turn to the West for help.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about Soviet intentions in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> will be a major issue facing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency In a landmark speech in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> in July 1985, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> committed the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to exerting its influence across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. A Soviet military threat seems remote but as one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> admiral said, `` They have the capability.'' Soviet intentions, added a senior diplomat, are the issue. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, after winning a string of fishing agreements with small island nations and then losing them, is now courting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The collapse of <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Australia-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand-U.S. </LOCATION> military treaty _ is no longer an issue. But what is, is the `` whole range of alliances'' in a part of the world where a nuclear-capable <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is not as welcome as it once was. Other issues likely to cross <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk are those of immediate concern to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s refusal to abandon nuclear testing in the area, its policies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, the future of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and the prospect of mining for minerals there. Also, there is the impact of the `` Greenhouse Effect,'' which scientists predict will swamp some small island nations resulting in a flood of `` economic refugees.'' The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is no longer the lagoon of tranquility it used to be, as two military coups in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> attest. There are issues of direct consequence to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and therefore the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island nations have many of the problems of the Third World, and for that reason Soviet initiatives are being watched.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will be looking for reassurance from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that it is trusted as an ally and valued as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' No. 1 trading partner. A bruising campaign that gave Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> his second consecutive majority government put the spotlight on Canadian concerns that the country is taken for granted, ignored or overshadowed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The victory for <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to proceed, but it is a long-term pact that will be phased in over 10 years. Canadians will be looking for some signs that their willingness to cooperate with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can produce some tangible results in an easing of the trade squabbles still likely to occur in aspects uncovered by the agreement. And, with economic growth expected to slow down in both countries, great attention will be paid here to any plant closings attributed to the new trade pact. In other issues, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will be looking to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take promised steps to cut down sulphur dioxide emissions blamed in large part for producing the acid rain that devastates Canadian aquatic life in sensitive lakes and streams.

Renewing growth is vital for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, because the average Mexican's standard of living has suffered badly during years of austerity. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won a disputed election and better conditions would strengthen his mandate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> a sympathetic ear, and the two appeared to hit it off when they met in November. A recent $ 3.5 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> loan offer was seen as a vote of confidence. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is a hard-nosed negotiator, but he is unlikely to let pride get in the way of practical solutions. Other issues: _ Trade: <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> fears protectionist sentiment will cut access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, restricting growth opportunities A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recession would also hurt <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> if exports went down. _ Migration: <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> resents the way migrants looking for jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are treated, since they fill an apparent need <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> argues that growth is a key here too, because more jobs in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would reduce migration. _ Drugs: <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has promised a harder fight against drug trafficking, but expects the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to crack down on demand _ <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: Mexicans are hopeful the new administration will focus less on an anti-communist crusade in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which was very unpopular here

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been stuck with 20 million pairs of 3-D glasses ever since the last episode of `` Moonlighting'' was nixed last spring by the writers' strike. It says it just found a super way to use them. The soft drink giant, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday they would cooperate in a three-dimensional broadcast of the 12-minute Super Bowl XXIII halftime show and a 45-second Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> ad next month. The Atlanta-based company said its bottlers would distribute the special glasses, which will enable fans to see the 3-D approach, with purchases of Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in the two weeks before the Jan. 22 contest for the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> championship. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing with the `` Moonlighting'' producers that a commercial and a portion of the final show of the 1987-88 season would be shot with the new 3-D technology. But the episode was canceled after the writers went on strike and the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> commercial never was made. Production of the glasses was halted at 20 million and they were stored while <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> looked for other TV showcases. Network executives said the halftime program would be the first live 3-D broadcast on network television, and would continue <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s tradition of innovation in football coverage <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> broadcast a `` silent minute'' to give viewers a break from the Super Bowl pre-game show in 1986 and aired an entire regular season game with no announcers a few years ago. Viewers will need the glasses to get the 3-D effect, but a new technology called Nuoptix 3-D, developed by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, founder and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Los-Angeles-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuoptix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, leaves the picture normal for others. The patented process avoids the distortion or double-imaging of the picture that the 3-D processes of the 1950s caused for those without special glasses. Not content to let a volley sound in the cola wars without responding, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced separately Monday that its Diet Pepsi brand has agreed to be the official sponsor of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> player talent show to be broadcast before the big game. The talent show will match <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> players in competition as singers, dancers and comedians. Calling the announcement `` a surprise move,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president of marketing and sales, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorelli </PERSON>, said `` Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s end-run on Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> just signaled the start of an intense off-the-field battle.'' Asked about <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement at the news conference where he announced the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> executive producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> said the network had not settled sponsorship of the pre-game talent show. But a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenize </PERSON>, insisted that <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> had returned a signed contract to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last week and that the deal was done. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Somers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, dominate the $ 43.2 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft drink business. Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> is the best-selling diet soft drink and the third biggest seller overall with about 8.2 percent of the overall soft drink market. Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> ranks second in the category and fourth overall at 5.2 percent. The two soft drink giants are always on the lookout for splashy new ways to boost anticipation of their commercials and get big audiences for them. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beindorff </PERSON>, vice president for advertising at <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, said he had been aproached with dozens of opportunities to showcase a 3-D commercial, but rejected them until the Super Bowl opportunity came along. `` This is not just a few minutes or a couple of special effects,'' <PERSON> Beindorff </PERSON> said. `` It's not just pre-game fluff or a post-game throwaway.''

 Settlement talks between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> over as yet unfiled securities fraud charges have reached a difficult stage, the investment firm's chief executive has told employees. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> also said Monday the investment firm could n't accept the terms presented to it, sources familiar with the remarks said. The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said the tone of the statement suggested an indictment had become more likely. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> made his remarks over a public-address system, and they were broadcast to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> branches nationwide. The sources paraphrased <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> as saying, `` Not at this point does a settlement make sense.'' The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been the subject of an intense investigation for more than two years stemming from its involvement with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the one-time speculator now serving a 3-year prison term for the biggest insider trading fraud in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing but has been negotiating with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office over the past two months in an effort to avoid an indictment for racketeering and securities fraud. The government reportedly has demanded that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> plead guilty to multiple felony counts and pay a fine as high as $ 750 million. In addition, the government has requested <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s assistance in implicating other possible wrongdoers, both within and outside the firm. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, declined comment on <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s reported remarks to employees. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Corley </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, also declined comment. There has been heightened speculation in the past few weeks that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would reach a plea-bargain settlement with the government before Christmas. Federal prosecutors have intensified the pressure by exacting cooperation from at least three traders in <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> high-yield bond department. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s problems began after <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> paid a $ 100 million fine to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 and agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge as part of his plea-bargain. Three months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed a wide-ranging civil lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, its high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other key employees, accusing them of conspiring with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to violate a range of securities laws. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was a pioneer in the $ 175 billion high-yield bond market. It is one of the most profitable Wall Street firms and has around 10,000 employees worldwide.

<HEAD>Federal Court Throws Out State Stock Arbitration Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has thrown out controversial first-in-the-nation state regulations, inspired by the 1987 stock market crash, that allowed stock traders to sue brokers more easily in financial disputes. In a 36-page ruling issued Monday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> threw out regulations promulgated in September by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. The regulations, set to take effect Jan., prevented stockbrokers from requiring customers to agree to arbitration in stock disputes instead of lawsuits. A top aide to <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the state likely would appeal the ruling. A coalition of brokers sued the state in September and <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> heard the case two weeks ago. In his ruling he said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 upheld the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses to govern resolution of controversies between brokers and their customers. Typically, the agreements state that in the event of a dispute, the customer and the broker would go into arbitration before a mutually acceptable party _ the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, for example _ rather than take the case to court. <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> ruled in favor of the brokers who argued that arbitration is a quicker, cheaper way of settling disputes and that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had improperly usurped federal authority in regulating securities trading. `` On the evidence before me, it appears that court litigation affords customers the opportunity to pay more in legal costs to get less in recovery,'' <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> wrote. `` To the degree that arbitration constitutes a more economical form of dispute resolution, it may be anticipated that regulations which discourage arbitration will have the effect of raising commission rates.'' The regulations, <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said, `` single out arbitration agreements for more demanding standards than are imposed by the general law of contract in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said the state regulations would increase the federal caseload at a time when the court system is already overburdened. `` My clients are delighted that the court agreed with our position that these regulations were invalid,'' said attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION> Bingham </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> represents the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and 10 brokerage firms, including <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said officials in <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>'s securities division still were reviewing the ruling Monday evening but he said, `` in all likelihood we will request the attorney general to appeal the decision. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said the regulations stemmed from a flood of complaints following the stockmarket crash of October 1987 when thousands of customers alleged that their urgent stock transactions were misplaced or mishandled. In the disputes that followed, <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said, stock customers found to their surprise that they had signed away their right to sue. The state regulations would have required brokers to fully disclose the terms of their arbitration agreements and give customers the option of maintaining their right to sue in court. `` Our beef is n't necessarily with the arbitration process,'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said. `` Our concern is with investors signing away their rights unknowingly.'' <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> said full disclosure is desirable but is not adequately defined in the state regulations.

<HEAD>`Always Open' Restaurant Chain Closing For Christmas Day For First
Time</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: In Tuesday AMs report; brief version for Monday PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LA MIRADA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The signs say `` Always Open,'' but for the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s restaurants across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will close their doors for Christmas Day. Locking those doors is a different story. Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and the keys ca n't be found. The company is having to install locks at about 700 restaurants, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, director of marketing at the company's southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> headquarters. The company decided to close this year so employees could have the day off. `` It will cost us about $ 5 million in sales,'' <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. The chain's 60,000 employees were so grateful for the holiday that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day. `` We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other people's families; for one day a year we want to take care of our own,'' he said. Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five employees. In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, the companywide closing solved manager <PERSON> Almaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Legesse </PERSON>'s problem of choosing which employees of a <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> restaurant to give the day off. `` I had a big list. ... I was having a hard time,'' she said. The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers, was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. `` We never had locks,'' Ms. <PERSON> Legesse </PERSON> said. `` After so many years of working Christmas every year it's real nice,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevene </PERSON>, a manager at a <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s near a turnpike in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Me. `` People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushman </PERSON>, manager of a <LOCATION> Pismo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s. `` On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and cooks,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bushman </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s has locks but she had to check to see if the keys fit. Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average days at <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. `` We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that's all day _ not just at midday,'' <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said `` It actually starts on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.'' The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own decisions. <PERSON> Winifred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, a manager at two <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s franchise restaurants in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said they would remain open for the biggest day of the year. But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s. `` Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with no children or elderly people with no family, she said. `` But not anymore. You have so many one-parent families.'' The three franchise <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and one in Fairbanks will be open, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, manager of an <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> restaurant. Ms. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas, which is second only to Mother's Day in bringing in customers.

 The economy, held back by the summer drought, expanded at a moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent last summer, the slowest pace in nearly two years, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed in the third quarter after growing at a robust 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter and 3.0 percent in the second. That would be good news for analysts worried that the economy is overheating and becoming inflationary, except that the underlying strength is being masked by the temporary effects of the drought, which seared pastures and shriveled crops. That knocked $ 12.3 billion off the GNP, which was at an inflation and seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 4.01 trillion in the July-September period. Excluding the drought, the GNP grew 3.9 percent in the second quarter and 3.0 percent in the third. The GNP figure for the third quarter was a slight downward revision from a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent issued a month ago. Most economists had been looking for a slight upward adjustment. It was the slowest pace of expansion since the fourth quarter of 1986. Most of the downward revision was accounted for by a larger-than-previously-thought decline in government spending. The department also increased its estimate of inflation. A price index tied to GNP and adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in buying patterns increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the third quarter, up from 5.0 percent in the second and the fastest pace in six years. In an accompanying report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said corporate profits after taxes advanced 3.9 percent in the third quarter after soaring 8.9 percent in the second quarter. An earlier estimate had said third quarter profits rose only a slight 0.2 percent. Although GNP growth, at least for the third quarter, has slowed to the 2.0 to 2.5 percent range that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> considers sustainable without inflation, most analysts believe the economy is rebounding in the current quarter. But again, the drought is likely to artificially lower the GNP number. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> members fear that a GNP growth rate higher than the target range will strain factory capacity, leading to shortages and resulting price increases. Also, by boosting employment, the growth encourages employers to bid up the prices of attracting qualified workers by raising wages. The `` cure'' is higher interest rates designed to make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to spend. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening since March has had only a marginal impact on the economy. With growth so strong and jobs so strong it looks like the economy has continued to march on,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boltz </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a financial services firm in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> capped a series of tightening moves in mid-August by boosting the discount rate, the rate it charges for loans to member banks, by a half percentage point to 6.5 percent. When the numbers came in for August and September, it seemed as if the dose of tighter money was working. The unemployment rate, after hitting a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June, jumped to 5.6 percent in August, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched measure of factory operating rates was holding steady, and retail sales posted a rare decline in September. But, a series of government reports over the last seven weeks shows that the economy came roaring back in October and November. Unemployment dipped down again to the levels of late spring, retail sales surged and the factory operating rate climbed to the highest level in nine years. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> responded last week by bumping up the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter of a percentage point to 8 ~ percent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an economic consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said it is a question of when, not if, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will tighten further. `` Every -LRB- economic statistic -RRB- that has appeared this month has been as strong or stronger than the consensus. I do n't know what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is waiting for. If this had been -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, the discount would have been raised. ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Alan -RRB- <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is more cautious, but there comes a time when it is better to get it over with,'' he said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is expecting a discount rate hike early in 1989. <PERSON> Boltz </PERSON>, however, says the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may be satisfied with further increases in the federal funds rate and may be saving a discount rate hike, the most dramatic move it can take, for a crisis like a precipitous fall in the value of the dollar. Both look for strong GNP growth _ higher than a 4 percent annual rate _ until higher interest rates take their toll, sometime in mid-1989.

 <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> opened the door Tuesday to new stock markets, leasing companies and insurance firms to help mobilize public funds and create new financing sources to support production. The new policy, contained in presidential and ministerial decrees, allows the private sector to open new securities exchanges that would operate side-by-side with the stock market organized by the government. Organizers of the new exchanges must be Indonesians. Exchanges may be opened in cities other than <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, and company shares may be listed on both private exchanges and the existing <ORGANIZATION> Jakarta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The regulations also banned insider trading based on confidential information about the companies issuing stock. The government also opened the way to formation of leasing companies, either by Indonesians or by joint ventures owned at least 15 percent by Indonesians. It simplified procedures for establishing insurance companies, and specified that joint ventures in this field must be at least 20 percent Indonesian-owned. The new regulations permit banks and other financial insitutions to trade securities and engage in credit-card and consumer finance businesses.

 Stock prices advanced broadly this morning, extending the gains of the past two sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose nearly 22 points on Monday, was up another 8.75 to 2,181.43 after 30 minutes of trading. That was near its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 set Oct. 21. Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of more than 2 to 1 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 681 issues up, 286 down and 570 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 30.32 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 19.41 million shares at the same point on Monday. The market appeared to take some encouragement this morning from a pair of economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and moderate economic growth. The government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in November, a slightly slower pace than some analysts expected. In another report the government lowered its estimate of economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent. But while some analysts say the conditions are right for a year-end stock rally, others said the recent gains may be short-lived. The skeptics note that short-term interest rates near 9 percent are are making <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues attractive compared with the uncertain yields on stocks. In the credit markets today, however, rates on one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were slightly lower.

 Inflation slowed last month to an annual rate of just 3 percent, the government said today, as clothing prices fell for the first time since August and food prices stabilized for the first time since last February. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Consumer Price Index, after seasonal adjustments, rose just 0.3 percent in November, compared with a 0.4 percent gain a month earlier. Before the seasonal adjustments, prices rose just 0.1 percent, the department said. The monthly inflation figure, rounded off in the announcement to 0.3, was actually 0.25, adding up to 3 percent annually. The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 per cent for the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the first 11 months. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> commented, `` Consumer price inflation appears to be moderating.'' He noted that inflation has been lower in the second half of the year than the first half. With only December left, another month similar to November could enable the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to finish its last year in office meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today that the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, expanded at a moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent in the third quarter, held back by the summer drought. For the same period, the department reported that after-tax corporate profits rose 3.9 percent, down from a robust 8.9 percent increase the previous quarter. Food prices, which had risen at an annual rate of 10.9 percent from April through September because of the summer drought, were unchanged in November after rising only 0.2 percent in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Clothing prices that had jumped a total of 4 percent in September and October with the introduction of new back-to-school and fall fashions fell 0.3 percent last month. ` Widespread promotional sales for footwear and women's and girl's clothing were largely responsible for the November decrease,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Housing and shelter costs, including residential rents, rose another 0.3 percent, the same pace they have maintained over the past nine months. Natural gas and electric rates were up 1.8 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, from October, more than offsetting a 2 percent drop in prices for more heavily purchased home heating oil, the government said. The November decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil. Its price is now 10.8 percent below what it was last spring. Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from October but remain 0.2 percent less than they were at the end of last year and 28.1 percent below their peak level of March 1981. Excluding food, energy and shelter, consumer prices for other items rose an average 0.2 percent in November compared with a jump of 0.7 percent the previous month. The November increase raised the CPI to 120.3 from 120.2 in October, meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing $ 100 in a 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 120.30 last month. In November 1987, that same marketbasket would have cost $ 115.40. New car prices declined by 0.2 percent, reflecting the introduction of rebates on some of the new 1989 models after rising by more than a full percentage point in September and October. However, auto financing and insurance costs continued to advance dramatically, with the former up 1.5 percent and the latter 0.9 percent above October. Airline fares also jumped a dramatic 1.1 percent. Medical costs, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent last month and are up at an annual rate of 7 percent so far this year. Other goods and services also rose 0.4 percent and are 7.1 percent higher than they were a year ago, the government said. Food buyers last month found seasonally adjusted meat, poultry, fish, egg and fresh fruit and vegetable prices lower than they were in October. However, prices were higher for canned and dried fruits and vegetables, restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages.

 For months, nearly two dozen $ 30,000-a-year jobs in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> with the world's largest windshield-wiper maker have gone begging. <ORGANIZATION> Trico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has failed to find the skilled labor needed for the positions. The company, with twin plants on both sides of the Mexican border, also has to import millions of dollars in supplies from other states, though it would prefer to do more business in this area beset by poverty and unemployment. Companies manufacturing in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s maquiladora program would like to leave hundreds of millions of dollars in this and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities along the border, if only they had some place to spend it. Researchers say a fortune is bypassing these communities while they struggle to catch up with and understand the industrial revolution taking place in their backyards. Since the mid-1960s, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s maquiladora program allowing foreign operation of manufacturing facilities has brought 1,200 mostly U.S.-operated plants to its northern frontier. The companies use inexpensive Mexican labor and then export the components back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, paying tax only on the value added by the labor of the maquiladora workers, who numbered 330,000 in 1987. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, including automobile and electronics manufacturers, have moved operations to the border from the industrialized <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Northeast. But most of the parts and supplies come from outside of the border area. A study of the 104 maquiladora plants on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s side of the border between <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> found they annually spend $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.6 billion for parts and supplies. More than 90 percent is spent outside <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entrepreneurship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the study. The center, however, learned from companies operating on the border that those firms would like to buy 25 percent to 30 percent of their component parts and materials locally. That would bring hundreds of millions of dollars to the region _ if only those materials were available on the border. `` The advantages of having a supplier here along the border are significant, in terms of cost reductions, in terms of just communicating and being able to get quick turn around on style changes, on modifications and specifications and so forth,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. `` Now it makes a lot of sense to have your supplier as nearby as possible.'' But the metal and molded-plastic parts they need just are not available in most border areas, so they buy from more established locales. Most of the final product assembly also takes place elsewhere. <ORGANIZATION> Trico </ORGANIZATION> is one of the few companies operating a true `` twin plant,'' the ideal maquiladora with a significant work force on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican boundary. The 450 employees in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> finish the windshield wiper products begun by the 1,400 workers in its <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> plant. The Buffalo, N.Y.-based company produces more than 70 percent of the original automobile windshield wiper equipment worldwide, as well as a majority of wiper blades found in auto supply stores. Eighty percent of <ORGANIZATION> Trico </ORGANIZATION>'s production has moved to <LOCATION> Brownsville-Matamoros </LOCATION> in the past two years, but it still buys most supplies and parts in highly industrialized areas up north. `` The game plan is to get those manufacturing operations set up down here to eliminate the need to transport parts down here,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Trico </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> operation. But the area has no history of the type of technically complex manufacturing processes needed to produce those parts, and no experienced work force. `` There are certain skills like tool makers that we ca n't get down here,'' <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON> said. A nationwide shortage of tool-and-die workers to produce precision machine parts is even worse in an area where there has been little need for that type of skill, he said. So the company, with 22 openings for the high-paying tool-and-die positions, has started in-house training, but it takes several years to turn out an experienced tool maker. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Trico </ORGANIZATION> contracts the work out, usually to tool-and-die operations far away. `` We do n't have any choice,'' <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON> said. `` None of the locals really relate to that type of manufacturing,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpton </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and head of the industrial development committee for the city's chamber of commerce. `` The locals may think about putting up a building to lease to the industries, but not putting up a building to actually do the manufacturing,'' <PERSON> Simpton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauceda </PERSON>, who has one of the few tool-and-die operations in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, said his <PERSON> Sauceda </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grinding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> constantly stays busy. On one recent afternoon, his shop was producing quality control gauges for the 1990-91 models of an automobile manufacturer he chose not to identify, with skills he brought back from his years in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. They are skills he realizes his native region lacks. `` This is not an industrial area,'' <PERSON> Sauceda </PERSON> said. `` It's agricultural The area's just starting to be industrial.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, who operates Ten-Tex Tool and <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, said he could double his business if he had the skilled tool-and-die workers. Companies supplying the maquiladoras also hesitate to relocate to the border without the security of having several customers in the area, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. That presents opportunities for new local companies, he said, but skilled-labor shortages and banks inexperienced in financing industrial plants hinder new growth. There are some local supply operations gradually developing. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSpain </PERSON> has seen the growth since three years ago, when he founded <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Source </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, producing molded plastic parts in the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Feria </LOCATION>. `` There were n't any suppliers in the area, and now there are 30,'' said <PERSON> DeSpain </PERSON>, who has formed a maquiladora consulting firm, <ORGANIZATION> Intelecsis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, since leaving Unit Source after a takeover. Cities, however, should not overlook the importance of warehousing and transportation jobs the maquiladoras create on the American side of the border, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Laredo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would personally rather have the largest maquila and manufacturing operations in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, using <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, as their warehousing and distribution centers, their packaging centers and their sales centers, than I would to have the same division give us a labor-intensive, minimum-wage kind of factory that they're better able to do somewhere else,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said.

 When <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> was a teen bride whose young Marine husband was off fighting the Korean War, she thought it a stroke of luck that she landed a job fresh out of high school as a legal secretary. She had no way of knowing the on-the-job training in her northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> hometown of <LOCATION> Yreka </LOCATION> would support her and her young son after she divorced five years later. Moreover, it would give birth to a multimillion-dollar business that's about to go nationwide. After more than 30 years of providing office help to attorneys, as factotum, job trainer and job counselor, <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> wants to become to paralegal employment services what <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON> was to <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>'s corporation, <PERSON> Legalstaff </PERSON>, may be the first in the nation to franchise employee placement agencies that cater exclusively to the legal profession. Legalstaff is the outgrowth of <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>'s 15-year-old placement service with offices in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that grossed $ 1.4 million in the first 10 months of this year. The business provides law firms with permanent and temporary legal secretaries, paralegals and attorneys. <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> said franchising will allow her to tap an unmined market without the problem of finding the right managers and job counselors for new branch offices. She'll also earn about $ 25,000 for every franchise sold. Her maps would cross-section cities by every 1,500 law firms, making <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> worth more than $ 100,000 each in licensing fees. `` I want to eventually run around and play Colonel <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> ... have my pictures taken with the -LRB- franchise -RRB- owners on their 10th anniversary, or whatever,'' she said in an interview in her downtown <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, 55, was a founder of the former <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Careers </ORGANIZATION>, a two-year <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> business school which she sold in 1984 to Barclay Colleges. Although <ORGANIZATION> Legalstaff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is barely a year old, <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> said she expects to sell 100 franchises within three years, a growth estimate she called `` very controlled.'' Already, she said she's received 50 responses to ads in the Wall Street Journal, and expects negotiations for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> franchises to conclude by the end of the year. Hitching onto national trends toward a litigious society and service economy, <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> said her specialized matchmaking service also meets the unique needs of the tradition-steeped legal profession. The nation's lawyer population is expected to burgeon to 1 million by 1990, aggravating a chronic shortage of qualified legal secretaries and paralegals. <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> said her service saves attorneys expensive time in finding loyal office help who are crucial to a trade that produce volumes of paper in often arcane language under court deadlines. For workers looking to change law firms, she said, the service offers discretion. `` It's very difficult to change jobs -LRB- as a legal secretary -RRB- because there are no secrets, you see,'' she said. `` You put the word out that you're looking for a job and the boss gets unhappy. `` You have to be discreet about it because attorneys are very territorial.'' Because her business competes with other placement agencies for job applicants, <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> said the service is free to job seekers. She charges law firms the equivalent of one month's salary for every worker placed. <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> ventured into the personnel business in 1973 after working for law firms in <LOCATION> Yreka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and the Capitol office of <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cologne </PERSON>, a state assemblyman and senator who later became a federal judge. She said the idea of a legal placement service dawned on her six years earlier when she helped a lobbyist open a law office and could n't find a temporary secretary to fill in while she studied for midterm examinations at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. She eventually earned her bachelor's in English and masters in business administration at <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>. When she opened her doors, she was immediately swamped with calls from 52 law offices but received only five applications from job seekers. That prompted her soon after to open her school to train legal secretaries and paralegals. Her second husband, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, eventually followed her into the law field. The government analyst-turned-attorney has his office next to hers. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> said franchising was a natural step for her business. `` I wanted to grow. I did n't want to put a lid on it. It's not exciting for your staff if your business is n't growing I have n't noticed anyone around here getting bored.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Profit-taking in the wake of Monday's surprisingly strong showing pressured the market early, and traders said overnight rain in the soybean growing regions of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> helped keep the lid tight. Even corn was unable to post gains, despite an announcement the Soviets had bought 750,000 tons of corn, and are expected back for another shipment of the same size, possibly later this afternoon. On the opening, wheat was 1 cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.35 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 cents lower, with December at $ 2.69 a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower, with December at $ 2.28 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 6 cents lower, with January at $ 7.89 a bushel Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed to mostly lower at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with December at 73.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with January at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher, with December at 44.60 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .17 cent to .40 cent lower, with February at 45.00 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are the big winners in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to accept a sweetened $ 5.68 billion takeover bid from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, securities analysts say. `` The shareholders are the first people to profit, from what I can tell,'' June Page, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` The employees of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> should profit tremendously and ultimately the consumer.'' `` They had no other direction to go. We knew that from day one,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know if I can answer the question why they prolonged the pain for so long.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> on Monday defended management's 2 -LCB- - month battle against the buyout bid, which ended Sunday when the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company accepted Grand Met's latest $ 66 a share offer `` I think the practical fact of the matter is that we got them to move off a very firm position,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KARE-TV </ORGANIZATION> of the Twin Cities. `` So I do n't apologize for our strategy one bit.'' In a letter Monday to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the company was pleased with the outcome because it represented a 10 percent increase from <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Met </ORGANIZATION>'s original $ 60-a-share tender offer and because the new ownership will allow Burger King franchises a chance to grow. `` It's time to take off the gloves and get on with the next chapter,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` We're convinced that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding brand franchises and products will prosper with the enthusiastic backing and support of Grand Metropolitan PLC. Meanwhile today, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> reported its profit fell 38 percent in the second quarter ended Nov. 30 and 10 percent for the first six months of fiscal 1989 `` due to a substantial one-time investment in the Burger King advertising fund and the cost of responding'' to Grand Met's takeover offer. Second-quarter net income totaled $ 44.8 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $ 72.5 million, or 84 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Sales rose to $ 1.75 billion from $ 1.69 billion. For the six months, net earnings were $ 116.2 million, or $ 1.35 per share, vs. $ 129.3 million, or $ 1.50 per share, during the comparable period of fiscal 1988. Sales were $ 3.23 billion, compared with $ 3.14 billion, last year. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors approved the takeover Sunday after a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge on Friday invalidated its key takeover defenses: a `` poison pill'' plan and the proposed spinoff of its Miami-based Burger King fast-food chain. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> common stock was trading at about $ 39 a share the day before <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Met </ORGANIZATION> launched its takeover bid Oct. 4. The stock closed up $ 3.12 -LCB- Monday at $ 65.37 -LCB- a share. In addition to benefiting <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, shares, the Grand Met takeover should secure the jobs of most company employees. But analysts said top <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> executives probably should start looking elsewhere for work, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said he could not comment on whether top executives or employees would be laid off. Top management has been under fire in recent years because of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s lackluster financial performance. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, earlier this year succeeded <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, who came out of retirement to head <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> on an interim basis in February after former chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> resigned under pressure. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s results were depressed again this year. After-tax profit plummeted 62 percent to $ 69.3 million on sales of $ 6.2 billion, largely because of a restructuring charge associated with the sale of its Godfather's Pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and consolidations. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, which started as <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> with a single flour mill in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> in 1869, makes <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> flour, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetables, <PERSON> Haagen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazs </PERSON> ice cream and a variety of other products. In addition to <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Bennigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale restaurant chains, which <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Met </ORGANIZATION> has said it would sell. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> employs 100,000 people. Grand Met is a British real estate, liquor and gambling conglomerate. Its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings include <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> dog food and Pearle Vision Centers.

 The stock market pushed ahead today for the third consecutive session, taking some encouragement from a new inflation report. Trading was more active than in the previous session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 21.97 points on Monday, was up another 8.93 at 2,181.61 at noon on Wall Street. That approached its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 set Oct. 21. Advancing issues led decliners by 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 711 issues up, 578 down and 578 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 82.05 million shares at noontime compared with 76.23 million shares at the same point on Monday. The market appeared to take some encouragement from a pair of economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and moderate economic growth. The government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in November, a smaller rise than some analysts expected. In another report, the government lowered its estimate of economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent. `` The numbers were pleasantly in line with Street expectations, and gave some confidence to the market,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, head of equity bloick trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The reports contributed to a rally in the credit markets, where prices of some long-term bonds were up by as much as $ 9 for every $ 1,000 in face value while interest rates pulled back. But while some analysts say the conditions are right for a year-end stock rally, others said the recent gains may be short-lived.

 A federal judge blocked a federal plan to require random drug testing of 3 million interstate drivers nationwide but did allow pre-employment and post-accident testing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order Monday against random drug testing of truckers and interstate bus drivers. She told government lawyers she wanted to review how widespread substance abuse is in the trucking industry before a future hearing. The material published in the Federal Register in support of testing amounted to nothing more than `` a well-taken diatribe against drug abuse in American society,'' <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>. The program was to start Wednesday, but the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not require companies to conduct any actual testing until next December, according to department spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>. More than 1 million other private employees in the rail, airline and maritime industries are scheduled to begin random testing. The order expires Dec. 30, when <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> is scheduled to hear arguments on a longer-lasting injunction against all testing programs affecting truckers and interstate bus drivers. Marks declined to comment on <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>'s ruling, saying the government would present its side on Dec. 30. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Owner-Operator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which challenged the testing program, said drug abuse among truck drivers `` is probably below the national average.'' `` There's no basis to think there's a severe problem,'' King told reporters. He said random drug testing would sacrifice `` the rights of millions of truck drivers ... in hopes of catching a few.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said his organization, which has 9,000 members, sued on behalf of all 300,000 independent owners of heavy-duty trucks and small truck fleets. He said <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>'s order applies to all interstate truck and bus drivers, but not to inter-city bus drivers, who have separate drug testing regulations. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he hoped to reach agreement with government lawyers on an extension of the ban on random drug testing before the temporary restraining order expires. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> testing program was announced Nov. 14. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said at the time that transportation employees were no more immune from drug abuse than the rest of society, listing a series of accidents and other evidence.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday called for a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ruling in the dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban on hormone-treated meat which is to take effect Jan. 1 and threatens to trigger a trade war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> immediately opposed the request, saying the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> sought an `` instantanous legal finding'' that had no basis under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> representative, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that the threatened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory measures, a 100 percent punitive duty on a range of products, were a `` further affront against the multilateral trade system'' set up by the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. He said the case had wide ramifications and urged the council to rule on the legal issues involved and decide on remedies. A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiator, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ban amounted to a `` unilateral decision to simply prohibit $ 120 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports per year.'' He said it was a `` wholesale disruption of traditional trade flows'' on alleged grounds of health but that the measure was not backed up by scientific evidence. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had repeatedly rejected proposals to have the case examined by an impartial scientific body. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained willing to pursue the matter under any appropriate <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> process as long as the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> deferred the ban. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was aware that there were different views on the use of growth hormones in meat but that it had to `` listen to its consumers'' who did not want such meat. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> supported the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying that it considered the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> approach excessive. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the Canadian representative, said in the brief debate that growth hormones were proven to be safe if used properly. There was no decision on the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> request and the matter was expected to come up again at the next <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session in February. In other business, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> formally demanded that a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel be set up to rule in its dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over punitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duties imposed in response to an alleged lack of Brazilian patent protection for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceutical products. <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation was in clear violation of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules and in breach of commitments not to impose new unilateral trade restrictions during the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of world trade liberalization talks. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said there had been no alternative left to defending legitimate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests but that the measures would be lifted as soon as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> acts upon the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to ensure full patent proection. The measures cover $ 39 million worth of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an amount which <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said reflects the damage suffered by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceutical industry. Twenty-eight countries backed <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s position, including the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which said also that the case argued for action on patents in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round talks. As the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposed the Brazilian request up a panel, the council did not take a decision but was expected to discuss the case again at its February session.

 Share prices on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange finished a listless session higher Tuesday, as an optimistic start to Wall Street and better-than-expected British money supply figures helped fuel a bit of buying interest. However, traders cautioned that activity was still light as players attention focused on the holidays and Friday's release of British trade figures for November. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 6.9 points, or 0.4 percent, stronger at 1,777.4. Equities rose following news that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s money supply grew more slowly than expected, which dealers said is another sign that the British economy is finally beginning to slow down and that interest rates might not have to be nudged higher in the near future to quell an overheating economy. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s narrow money supply M-0, which consists of notes and coins in circulation plus banks' operational balances with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, rose an estimated 0.2 percent in November. The markets had expected a gain of between 0.3 percent and 1.3 percent. Volume was a moderate 331.6 million shares, compared with the 403.8 million shares that changed hands Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 10 points at 2,182.68 by the close of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session.

At that rate <ORGANIZATION> Carlson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, a personally owned 75-company conglomerate based in <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, would double its annual volume to $ 9 billion in 1992. Already, it is as large as some Fortune 100 companies. Unlike such companies, however, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> remains entrepreneurial, constantly setting sales goals, publicly stating them so that there is no retreat, then setting new goals. It has never missed a five-year sales goal. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was selling soap to grocery stores in 1938 when he founded <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stamp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Constantly diversifying into other businesses, restlessly setting goals, he pushed company sales to $ 1 billion in 1978. Averaged out over the 40 years, that growth came to 33 percent a year compounded. The company was huge now, and growth of that sort does n't come as easily as in the smaller days. For one thing, you have to seek public funds. So, said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, in 1978 he thought it best to `` settle'' for 15 percent a year for the next five years. In 1982 sales reached $ 2 billion. Another 15 percent five-year plan began. In 1987 the company reached $ 4 billion. Ever the entrepreneur, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> then looked at his cash flow and decided there was enough money coming in to step up the pace to 17.5 percent. That's the goal each year through 1992. There's no resting at <ORGANIZATION> Carlson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. The conglomerate now has four major divisions: hospitality, incentives, travel and promotion. Among the companies are the highly rated Radisson hotel chain, TGI Friday's restaurants, <ORGANIZATION> Ask </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mr. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the oldest and largest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s incentive travel, <ORGANIZATION> Carlson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> It is forever in transition, continually evolving. In its evolution the company follows no rigid plan, says <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` I hire top people and they grow the company,'' he says. `` We're pulled ahead by big horses.'' Enthusiasm, imagination, innovation and motivation are important elements in <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s type of management, and goal-setting is basic to all of them. It began with little self-reminders in <PERSON> Curt </PERSON>'s wallet Now it's institutionalized. `` To succeed you must eat, sleep and dream your goals and quotas,'' he says. `` It's a fact, an absolute fact: You will never make as much progress without targets as you will with goal setting.'' Nevertheless, he calls himself cautious. He seeks to grow in `` bite sizes; I do n't shoot the wad.'' That way, if things do n't turn out as expected, `` you get a little blip in the earnings that can be corrected. Incentives spur achievement, and <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> officers who achieve are given such things as first-class, 17-day tours of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Throughout the year spouses are kept informed of how well their mates are doing. Not wanting to be left out, they spur their mates to higher achievement. The company remains the very same as it was 50 years ago in at least one respect: it is sales driven. `` You build as fast as you can,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> the other day. `` As soon as a salesman is making his pay you put on another.'' Every month <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> examines the income statement and balance sheet for each of the 75 companies. He watches the bottom line, the pursuit of goals. Should he suspect problems, he asks for backup information and explanations. So successful are the <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> management techniques that some of his people would set _ and probably reach _ even higher goals. But, says <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, `` you can only grow as fast as the money comes in.'' To open a new Friday's, for example, might take $ 2 million. `` I can not open 40 of them without taking money away from others.'' In a sense, therefore, the big growth goals are probably compromises. Perhaps its just as well because the goals are always publicly stated. As a consequence, they are avidly watched by the media. Fail to achieve a goal and everyone in town will know about it. `` You burn your bridges behind you,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> the magic motivator. `` We give a figure and we had better make it, because everyone is watching.''

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices posted across-the-board losses Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The markets opened under pressure because of profit-taking in the wake of Monday's surprisingly strong showing. Traders said overnight rain in the soybean growing regions of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> helped keep the lid tight. And even corn was unable to post gains, despite an announcement the Soviets had bought 750,000 tons of corn, and were expected back to announce a second purchase of the same size after Tuesday's close. `` We were overdue for a correction,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was no fresh news to move things and everybody felt the dramatic rises of the last few sessions had reached their top.'' On the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to -LCB- cent higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.34 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.67 a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 5 cents lower, with December at $ 2.21 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 \ cents to 7 cents lower, with January at $ 7.86 a bushel

 Employees are packing last-minute Christmas orders at the huge warehouse belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the final chapter of a best-selling year for the company. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON>, president of the nation's largest book club, said orders for 2 million books in December will help produce annual sales of about $ 200 million, up 12 percent from last year. `` We had a long, slow start but it has been a good fall,'' <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> said Monday in an interview at the mammoth facility just south of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. As a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> does not reveal exact sales figures for its books, videotapes or casettes. But <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> said the club received about 3 million book orders in November, at the height of the Christmas rush, prompting the company to increase its workforce from 600 to 800. He attributed the surge partly to the release of many of the year's best books late in the fall and partly to the holiday crunch. Fifteen percent to 20 percent of Book-of-the-Month Club sales are gifts, <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> said. `` We've pretty well dug out from the orders. We caught up last week,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1926 with 4,000 charter members, now has 2.7 million members. In addition to the main book club, the company offers seven speciality clubs for readers with interests in business, cooking, history, sailing, mystery novels, children's books and paperbacks. <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> also has been moving into the videotape market in recent years, often marketing videos as companions to books the club offers, <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> said. In February, for instance, <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> plans to offer two videos about <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> along with the month's main selection of `` Parting the Waters,'' a new book on the civil rights movement. Videos and audio cassettes now account for about 5 percent of the book club's business, <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> said. `` They are not a substitution sale. A lot of us have been nervous about this ... -LRB- but -RRB- it has n't hurt book sales,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s sales have more than tripled in the last 20 years, showing that reading is alive and well, <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON>, who will become chief executive officer in January, said the threefold increase of college graduates since World War II, to about 23 percent of the population, has helped the company's growth `` It's not as explosive as cable TV, but it's a good growth business,'' he said. During a reporter's visit recently to <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s labryinth of offices, employees were answering telephones, processing checks and sorting the 150,000 to 200,000 pieces of mail the club has been receiving daily Workers also stacked books in a three-stories high warehouse holding from 8 million to 10 million volumes on metal scaffolds stretching hundreds of yards. `` If you ca n't find something in here you enjoy reading, you ca n't find it anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehring </PERSON>, human resources manager at the plant. Orders received Monday will probably reach the buyer by Christmas, according to <PERSON> Crutcher </PERSON>, who said 99 percent of the orders received are processed within 24 hours.

 The stock market clung to some modest gains this afternoon, with blue-chip issues generally doing better than the broader market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 21.97 points on Monday, was up another 6.07 at 2,178.75 with one hour left in the session. The blue-chip index's post-crash closing high was 2,183.50 set Oct. 21. Advancing and declining issues were running about even in nationwide trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 711 up, 715 down and 546 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 132.42 million shares at 3 p.m. on Wall Street compared with 124.10 million shares at the same point on Monday. The market appeared to take some early encouragement from a pair of economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and moderate economic growth. The government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in November, and lowered its estimate of economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent. The reports contributed to a rally in the credit markets, where prices of some long-term bonds were up by as much as $ 8.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value while interest rates pulled back. But analysts said profit-taking eroded some of the stock market's early gains, and some observers warned the recent rally may be short-lived The skeptics note that short-term interest rates near 9 percent are making <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues such as one-year bills attractive compared with the uncertain yields on stocks. <ORGANIZATION> Inco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> led the list of most actively-traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, rising 1 -RCB- to 26 | <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was up ~ at 123 | Elsewhere in the technology group, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 95 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 | at 53 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> was up \ at 60 -LCB- First <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> was off 2 -LRB- at 25 -RCB-.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today selected former <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, a Republican, and former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a Democrat, as his representatives on the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition sources said. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled plans for announcing new Cabinet appointments today after the leading contender for secretary of health and human services was quoted as saying he favored a woman's right to an abortion The economic commission is seeking to find a bipartisan solution to the federal budget deficit. The panel was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year after the stock market plunge. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> is a longtime friend of the vice president's and is currently president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group which represents the country's largest banks. <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, a close friend of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is former general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. As for the Cabinet, comments by medical educator <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> over the weekend in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper resulted in an unexpected snag in his selection by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to head the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, transition sources said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled a scheduled 2 p.m. announcement of Cabinet choices. He had been poised to name <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass transit official <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as his transportation secretary, and sources had said an additional appointment had been likely, to add the first black to the new Cabinet. Two blacks have been in line for Cabinet posts, according to sources who spoke only on the condition of anonymity: <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and retired three-star Army Gen. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Constittion reported Sunday that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said in an interview that he supported a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. That appeared to be at odds with a statement released by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition office last week after the two men met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> The statement said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had assured the vice president he shared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-abortion views. Even though <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, was reported to have said that he, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, opposes the use of federal funds for abortions, the weekend interview threw an obstacle in his path to the Cabinet, transition and congressional sources said. The Atlanta Constitution reported today that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had said Monday night he was having trouble getting calls to the White House returned. `` I have simply concluded that, as a result of my not receiving a call back, the things have been put off, and hopefully it's not anything worse than that.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the newspaper his stand on abortion is private and he does not intend to disagree publicly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-abortion views. He said he believes `` there should be that right -LRB- to abortions -RRB-. ... At the same time, I am aware of the fact that the president-elect feels that that should not be the case, and I would have to, as secretary, should I be appointed, carry out his policies.'' A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition official said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not formally offered the post to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, despite widespread speculation and despite <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s own comments. The appointment of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to head the Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was announced Monday, cheering conservatives who have long viewed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman as a champion of their causes. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he does not plan to be conservative in approach when it comes to fighting for housing programs that work. `` I want to wage war on poverty. I do n't want to wage war on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the nine-term congressman said. `` I want it known that you can not balance the budget off the backs of the poor.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, a `` man of ideas'' who will lead his administration's war on poverty Asked if he had assurances that the former professional football quarterback would shed his critic's role, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I hope he has n't shed it. ... I want the objectivity of his judgment, and knowing <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, I'll get it.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> long has been an advocate of urban enterprise zones to spur investment in inner cities and has called for selling public housing units to tenants at low cost. He said he would be an activist <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary. As of Monday, the vice president had filled eight Cabinet posts and had six to go. His prospective choice for transportation secretary, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second largest mass transportation system. A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a pilot, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, 50, was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign director for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also ready to name <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, an agency recently raised to Cabinet level. <PERSON> Becton </PERSON> currently heads the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has said he hopes to finish his Cabinet by Christmas, also has yet to name his secretaries of labor, interior and energy. Sources said the two leading candidates for the labor slot are <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a Democrat and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who once served on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> labor lawyer and solicitor in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday did give some hints on his choice of energy secretary, suggesting he is `` leaning more towards'' someone with experience in nuclear energy rather than one with expertise in the oil and gas industry. He did not elaborate, but the disclosure seemed to knock some contenders out of consideration, including former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, emphasizing his opposition to tax increases, appointed Republican <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> on Tuesday to a national commission struggling to find a formula for reducing the federal budget deficit. `` I intend to hold the line on taxes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There are a lot of people around saying I ca n't do that.'' <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, onetime governor of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, served two terms in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before joining a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a longtime personal friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, spent 26 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and was a top-ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He now is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group which represents the country's largest banks. The appointments put the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> at its full strength of 14 people. The panel was created last year after the stock market's 508-point plunge. Some business leaders said <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>'s appointment diminished the possibility that the commission would recommend tax increases to cut the deficit. `` Laxalt is the type of guy who has read <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lips, and from everything I know about him he would be against taxes and would want to look on the spending side for deficit reductions,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has been a good fiscal conservative.'' Tempering skepticism that he voiced earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Some have suggested I am something less than enthralled with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. That's not right.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who takes office on Jan. 20, made that comment in a meeting with about 30 business leaders who pledged their support for a program of reducing the deficit by cutting spending rather than raising taxes. He issued a written statement later announcing the appointment of <LOCATION> Laxalt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. He noted that his announcement came only one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> ratified the Nov. 8 vote electing him president. `` The swiftness with which I am making these appointments underscores the importance I place on the need to reduce the federal budget deficit,'' he said. `` I believe that the experience these two public servants will bring to the panel will add to the quality of its deliberations,'' he said. At the beginning of the meeting with the business leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the deficit a tough problem. `` I'll just do my level best to send signals to the international markets that we're serious, that we're projecting it downward firmly, and I really believe that once that happens the adverse psychology that is forcing interest rates up beyond where in my view they ought to be will turn around,'' he said. `` I think once world markets think that we're definitively on a track without exception to have the deficit obliterated in whatever number of years it is, that in itself _ a bipartisan answer _ that in itself will be enormously beneficial to world markets,'' he said. In the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has appeared suspicious of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, warning that it might try to promote a tax-increase plan to cut the deficit. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he was looking forward to hearing from the group and listening to its suggestions. `` There are some very good people on there, Democrats and Republicans. They're serious, serious people. ... So I'm not looking for a battle with the them and there wo n't be one because they've been most cooperative since the election in terms of wanting to at least have from our key economic appointees their views.''

<TEXT>
 There is just too much good economic news around to suit the economic pessimists, and it has got to stop soon or they'll have to re-evaluate their scenarios. The good news is coming from every direction, from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and consumers and retailers and purchasing agents and even from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which deferred an expected increase in the discount rate. The latest retail sales showed a 1.1 percent improvement in November. Car sales were good. Housing construction was at the highest rate in seven months. The purchasing agents foresee strong, non-inflationary growth in 1989. The November report on producer prices shows they rose only three-tenths of 1 percent for the third month in a row. Even though they probed deeply into the guts of the report, inflation-fearers found little grist for their mill. The latest and broadest measurement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit showed a sharp improvement in the third quarter of the year, reducing the gap to its narrowest in three years. It might seem hard to argue with items such as these, but that is not so. There is a peculiar attitude toward good news today, the commonest one being that good news is bad because it will bring on inflation and recession. Never mind that neither is in sight. Just remember, if you will, that in the view of some economists inflation and recession are ever-present threats even in the best of times. Like sin, they attack the weak and unprepared. That being so, you must forever flagellate the economy during good times in order to ward off the threat. The economy should not be indulged, because it is inherently weak and subject to excesses that can destroy it. Beware. In this environment, improved retail sales are viewed as an indication of an economy overheating and heading toward inflation. News of the improved trade deficit had been broadcast only minutes when the oil analysts warned that higher prices for that product would slow and even reverse the improvement. The continued lowering of the jobless rate, and the continued expansion of the work force, the pessimists said, was very, very dangerous. When you reach jobless levels of 5 percent to 5.5 percent, they say, wages soon will rise. Sharply rising wages would mean inflation, of course, and so would a continued high level for plant usage. When you use up your most efficient plant space you ca n't make more goods except at a higher price. Beware. The latest report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, in which members overwhelmingly say the economy will improve next year, was said to be naive. Higher car sales just ca n't continue without rebates, said some of the auto analysts. The news of heightened activity in housing was immediately followed by economists warning that high interest rates would put that to an end. There are enormous problems facing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy _ budget deficits, trade deficits, low savings rates, excessive and probably very poor credit, banking problems, tax and revenue issues, the dollar, competitiveness ... So why is the news about people working, companies producing, deficits shrinking, prices remaining constant and houses abuilding accompanied by warnings? Sooner or later the inflation and recession watchers will have their way, because economies are cyclical. Expansions follow and precede contractions. The lines on the graph waver; seldom are they straight, as in straight up. The inflation-recession watchers know this, and they know, too, that you do not worry enough about it. They feel they must atone for your inattention to worry. Their motto is, `` If you only knew, you'd worry more. Seven years of uninterrupted economic expansion has left them dismayed, disturbed and disgruntled, and habitually inclined to growl, `` Bah, humbug.'' And so at Christmas, say the good people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` The same to you.''

 An encouraging report on inflation Tuesday added a spark of life to some financial markets and eased concerns about higher interest rates, but most analysts remained wary about the economy's direction. The dollar rallied against most major currencies in foreign exchange trading here and abroad, while bond prices headed sharply higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue rose nearly $ 10 per $ 1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell below 9 percent for the first time in a week. On Wall Street, however, stocks declined. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which shot up around 14 points at the opening, closed down 6.61 to 2,166.07. Economists said the markets were encouraged by a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed inflation on the consumer level slowed in November to an annual rate of just 3 percent. A drop in clothing prices and stabilized prices for food contributed to the decline, the department said. With only December left, another month similar to November could enable the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to finish its last year in office meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988, down slightly from 1987's 4.4 percent level. Also easing inflation worries was a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that the gross national product _ the broadest measure of economic health _ expanded at a moderate annual rate of 2.5 percent in the third quarter due to the summer drought. For the same period, the department reported that after-tax corporate profits rose 3.9 percent, down from a robust 8.9 percent increase the previous quarter. `` Low inflation is good for all the markets. It means the -LRB- economic -RRB- recovery was sustainable and long-lived,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It eases the pressure on interest rates, which have risen sharply in recent weeks partly on inflationary fears. Inflation is considered the nemesis of the financial markets, particularly the credit markets, because it erodes the value of fixed-income securities, sending yields higher to compensate for the loss. That depresses the stock market, which competes for investor money. And it often hurts the dollar because as prices of stocks and bonds slip, foreigners become less willing to exchange their currencies for dollars to buy those <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. Talk around Wall Street lately had centered around whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise its discount rate, a key short-term rate, to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from heading up. The discount rate is the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to member banks and savings institutions, and it's considered the most direct vehicle for the central bank to make its credit policies known. Most economists had predicted the rate would be raised 0.5 percentage point to 7 percent. However, Tuesday's inflation and GNP reports put some of those discussions to rest, at least temporarily. `` Some people who jumped on the interest-rates-going-up, fed-tightening bandwagon found out they were going on it prematurely,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` That's what the markets are telling you.'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> A. Stone, a senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, admits she was part of that majority group. `` We had expected that given the strength in some of the other economic numbers lately that we'd see the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> raising the discount rate pretty soon,'' she said. `` Well this -LRB- economic data -RRB- suggests that they may not have to do that right away, although there's still a good possibility after the first of the year that we'd see that happen.'' `` There are some people that are ... expecting a rise in the discount rate and the -LRB- bank's -RRB- prime rate before year's end,'' added <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a money market economist for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said that while the latest reports point to less inflation and slightly slower economic growth, `` a laundry list'' of other factors point in another direction `` The dollar remains weak overall, -LRB- business -RRB- capacity use rates are high and rising, and we have a very low unemployment rate,'' he said. `` Oil prices are also rising.''

<HEAD>St. Lawrence Seaway Boosts Some Tolls, Exempts Humanitarian Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most tolls on the St. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaway </PERSON> will increase by 4.5 percent in each of the next two years, officials of the binational waterway said Tuesday. The higher tolls being levied in 1989 and 1990 are needed to help the system keep pace with inflation, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Seaway Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Seaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. However, tolls for humanitarian-aid shipments will be eliminated and lumber shipments will be reclassified as bulk cargo and therefore have a lower toll, officials said. These moves are intended to spur increased movement of those two cargos. The combined toll for general cargo on the seaway in 1989 is $ 2.86 per metric ton, while the rate for bulk cargo is $ 1.33 per ton. To be qualify for the lower rate, the lumber must be timber or logs, sawed or split and rough or dressed into various sizes for use as beams, joists, rafters, studs, boards of planks. `` There is an abundance of forest land and wood product industries in the western Great Lakes region,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. `` The seaway is a natural transportation route for this virtually untapped market.'' However, he said the seaway handled only 9,400 metric tons of lumber shipments in 1987, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian agencies are hoping for a significant increase in the amount of lumber shipped through the system.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose Tuesday, strengthened by yearend corporate demand, speculation of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and a sharp jump in oil prices. Gold prices fell marginally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after mostly rising abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 413.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 414 late Monday. Currency strategists attributed the dollar's rise largely to orders for the currency from U.S.-based multinationals preparing to repatriate 1988 earnings. `` There is always good corporate demand for dollars in the last couple of weeks of the year,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannalfo </PERSON>, senior foreign exchange trader at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commodities futures firm. Others said persistent speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> raised demand for dollars. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated holdings worth more. In addition, an oil price hike in the energy markets supported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, since most oil contracts are priced in dollars. A rise in oil prices theoretically raises demand for dollars to pay for the oil. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 124.70 Japanese yen, up from 124.02. The dollar traded higher in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 125.05 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 125.33 yen, up from 124.08 yen late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the British pound cost $ 1.8070 late Tuesday, cheaper for buyers than $ 1.8230 late Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound cost $ 1.7957, down from $ 1.8209 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with rates late Monday: 1.7803 West German marks, up from 1.7645; 1.5035 Swiss francs, up from 1.4891; 1.2025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1998; 6.0813 French francs, up from 6.0270; and 1,310.75 Italian lire, up from 1,300.75. Other late rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Monday: 1.7750 marks, up from 1.7625; 1.4995 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870; 6.0675 French francs, up from 6.0235; 2.0080 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9895; 1,309.32 Italian lire, up from 1,296.50; and 1.2000 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1995.

<HEAD>Economic, Market Factors Play Scrooge At Britain's Christmas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High interest rates and slumping financial markets are casting Scrooge's shadow over Christmas for many British businesses and workers. Retailers say high interest rates _ the government's strategy for fighting inflation _ are depressing sales and prompting pre-holiday price markdowns. Industrial companies say their profits are feeling a pinch too, and investment firms have made major layoffs in the face of low trading volumes and fierce competition. The good news is that recent economic reports show the higher interest rates are beginning to slow the overheating economy. That means rates might not go higher. The bad news is that retailers are weathering a slowdown at what traditionally is one of the busiest times of the year. `` Trade is not what it usually is before Christmas. People are being more cautious with their money because of higher interest rates,'' said a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose 120 members operate stores on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s main shopping street. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostaani </PERSON>, a 36-year-old secretary buying Christmas wrapping paper, said higher interest rates were affecting her shopping. `` We bought our first house in April, when the interest rate was 8 percent. I'm trying to buy less,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mostaani </PERSON> said. To slow spending, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> pushed interest rates to 13 percent from June's decade-low 7.5 percent. Mortgage rates have risen to 12.75 percent from 11.5 percent and are expected to reach 13.5 percent in January. The annual inflation rate has picked up to 6.4 percent from 3.3 percent in January. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayliss </PERSON>, a 30-year-old accountant shopping in the same store as Mrs. <PERSON> Mostaani </PERSON>, also said he was worried about higher interest rates, but added: `` We'll not let it spoil Christmas, anyway.'' Some stores are taking pre-Christmas markdowns to move merchandise: <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a clothing and fabrics retailer, said it has reduced some women's designer clothes up to one-third. `` It's been a very difficult season for ladies fashions,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dighton </PERSON>, a Liberty spokeswoman. But she added: `` We're experiencing a particularly good Christmas season. We expect -LRB- sales -RRB- to be up between 12 percent and 14 percent throughout the store.'' Meanwhile, investment firms in the <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district, are laying off people because of competition and low trading volumes. The government's tight grip on spending also has hurt the market in gilts, or British government bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> announced Dec. 6 it was shutting its gilt and equity market-making operations, cutting 450 jobs just before the holidays. It was the biggest single cutback announced since the October 1987 stock market crash and Big Bang, the 1986 deregulation of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s financial markets. Separately, the British textile group <ORGANIZATION> Coats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viyella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> warned Wednesday its pre-tax profit could fall as much as 40 percent in 1988, mostly because of high interest rates and the strong British pound. But some Britons have been encouraged by three economic reports released this past week which show the government's tactics appear to be working. The government reported last Friday that the annual inflation rate held steady at 6.4 percent in November. Last Thursday, it reported the underlying annual growth of average earnings fell to 9 percent in October from 9.25 percent in September. Earlier, it said retail sales fell 0.5 percent in November. `` The retail sales figures we saw at the beginning of the week were certainly helpful to show that demand is coming off a bit,'' said economist <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Economists now are expecting inflation to peak at between 7.25 percent and 7.5 percent next year rather than at 8 percent or higher, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said But he added: `` We wo n't really see evidence -LRB- of a slowdown -RRB- until the New Year.''

 Some late afternoon selling left stock prices broadly lower Tuesday, frustrating the market's bid to extend its latest rally. Prices opened higher, appearing to take some encouragement from new government reports that indicated continuing low inflation and moderate economic growth. But profit-taking eroded the gains as the day progressed. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen nearly 40 points over the past two sessions, wound up falling 6.61 to close at 2,166.07. The widely-watched indicator of blue-chip stocks had been up nearly 10 points at midday but gave ground steadily in the final hour of the session. Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 652 up, 845 down and 515 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 161.09 million shares, down from 162.25 million Monday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 196.92 million shares. As the market opened, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrials moved up about 14 points during the first few minutes of trading. But the blue-chip market gauge was unable to sustain the advance, and soon dropped below its post-crash closing high of 2,183.50 reached Oct. 21. `` The early rally was a carryover from yesterday's strength,'' said <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalasani </PERSON>, chief investment strategist for <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` But the breadth of the market was poor.'' Before trading began, the government reported the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in November, and lowered its estimate of economic growth in the July-through-September period to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent. The reports tended to soothe worries that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move quickly to encourage even higher interest rates. The bond market rallied, as prices of some long-term issues rose as much as $ 9 for every $ 1,000 in face value and interest rates fell. But analysts said profit-taking eroded some of the stock market's early gains, driving prices lower The skeptics noted that short-term interest rates are hovering near 9 percent and are making yields on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues such as one-year bills attractive compared with the uncertain yields on stocks. <PERSON> Chalasani </PERSON> noted that the Dow Jones industrials have risen about 150 points since mid-November and said he suspects the year-end rally may `` pretty much be over.'' But <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the some further gains could be in store if stocks other than the blue-chip issues attract some buying interest. <ORGANIZATION> Inco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the Canadian metals mining company which began trading ex-dividend recently, was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, rising 1 \ to 26 -LRB- A company spokesman, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, declined to speculate about reasons for the price rise or activity. Among other active issues, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> lost -LCB- to 35 -RCB-, Tiger International slipped -LRB- to 19 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 29 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 123 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LCB- to 53 But two other technology companies fell as <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> lost 1 to 94 and <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> slipped \ to 60. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -RCB- to 26 -LRB-. The company announced last week it expected to lose $ 145 million to $ 190 million in the current quarter, and some analysts suspect the company's financial problems may not be over. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market fell $ 8.975 billion, or 0.33 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.64 to 155.74. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 1.46 to 320.51, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index lost 1.44 tp 277.47 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 0.34 to 376.05.

<HEAD>OECD Says West Should Take Steps to Combat Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western industrialized nations are likely to experience moderately low inflation rates over the next two years, but the threat of accelerated inflation and higher interest rates is just over the horizon, the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In the latest issue of its semi-annual Economic Outlook, the secretariat of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> suggested that some tightening of fiscal policy, as well as monetary policy, may be necessary in most countries to combat inflationary pressures. The secretariat also predicted that the current-account trade deficits of the three biggest <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> countries _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ will remain unacceptably high The Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> cautioned that although there appears to be no imminent problem, `` it would be unwise to conclude that external -LRB- trade -RRB- imbalances no longer represent an important threat to international financial stability.'' The report says the real, or inflation-adjusted, rate of expansion of western industrialized economies is likely to slow to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 1990 from 3.25 percent next year. The expansion rate this year was 4 percent. Growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to slow to 2.5 percent in 1990 from 3 percent in 1989 and 3.75 percent this year. The <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> also suggested that the dollar may strengthen against other currencies in the short term, especially if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy continues to expand at a rapid pace. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s growth rate is expected to moderate from a robust 5.75 percent in 1988 to 4.5 percent in 1989 and 3.75 percent in 1990. The outlook is similar in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where this year's growth rate of 3.75 percent is likely to decline to 2.5 percent in 1989, although there may be a very slight pickup to 2.75 percent in 1990. The organization's chief economist, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, described the overall picture for the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> economies as `` rather encouraging.''

 A House panel voiced tentative support Tuesday for a proposal to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to become self-financing by tapping millions of dollars in annual fees. The money would help boost the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s limited resources for such battles as its securities fraud case against the giant investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told a subcommittee hearing chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., that the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case dramatized the paltry resources of his agency, where there is a 20 percent annual turnover of staff lawyers who are lured to private firms by fatter salaries and better working The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in September filed a civil suit charging <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and some of its employees, including junk bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, with insider trading, stock manipulation and other violations stemming from the ongoing Wall Street insider trading scandal. The case has yet to go to court and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 75 million in legal fees and nearly $ 70 million in public relations and advertising costs _ more than the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current budget of $ 142.6 million, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations was told. Pitting little more than a dozen of the regulatory agency's poorly paid lawyers against more than 100 high-priced Wall Street attorneys representing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> `` is like trying to fight Godzilla with a slingshot,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> endorsed proposals in a new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff study to allow the agency to become self-financed by using the fees it collects for securities registrations, transactions and various These fees, which totaled $ 248 million in fiscal 1988, are deposited in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s general fund and are not available to the agency. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said that in the past few years, fee revenues have been more than double, or nearly double, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s annual appropriation. `` It is my firm view that something must be done to address the growing deficiencies in the resources available to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to carry out its statutory responsibilities,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. `` It is also my view that something will be done.'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and several subcommittee members agreed that the most controversial proposal would be to create a permanent <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> trust and revolving fund, financed by fee collections, which the agency could spend under special authority of a congressional oversight committee. The self-financing concept drew praise from Democrats and Republicans on the panel. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> cited the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in September not to seek prosecution of suspected securities violations in the $ 2.25 billion default on municipal bonds issued by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> because of a lack of enforcement staff. `` The lesson is, if you're going to mess up, mess up big,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. `` The fact is, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> just does n't have the resources to go after these big cases. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said a self-financing mechanism would give the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> flexibility to cope with the growing automation of securities markets, increasingly complex financial packages and trading techniques, sophiscated schemes for market manipulation and insider trading, escalating corporate takeover attempts and the rapid growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign securities markets. Enforcement of securities laws has suffered because of <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff problems, such as starting salaries of $ 27,716 for young lawyers who can command as much as $ 71,000 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firms, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. `` We have evidence of cases we could bring but do n't because we do n't have the resources to do it,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. He refused to cite specifics, but said some of these cases involve `` penny stock fraud'' perpetrated against small investors by `` boiler room operations'' that move from city to city. In another matter, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> refused to comment on reports quoting <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> that negotiations with federal prosecutors had broken down and that his firm might be hit with a criminal racketeering indictment soon.

<HEAD>Coffee Overflows Limit as Concerns Rise Over Dockworkers' Strike
in
Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices made their most dramatic surge in five consecutive sessions of advances, overrunning the daily trading limit Tuesday amid growing concerns over a lengthening strike by dockworkers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` The longer the strike remains in place,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` the more explosive this will get.'' On other markets, cocoa moved in sympathy with coffee and registered sharp gains; platinum came off the floor and posted moderate gains after three straight days of reverses; and the January contract for crude oil futures skyrocketed $ 1.42 when the brokerage arm of a large commodity trading house got caught selling the market short on the day the contract expired. Coffee prices rocketed 10.35 cents and 10.58 cents for the spot March and May contracts, respectively, and settled up the 6-cent daily trading limit for the remaining deferred contracts at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. March closed at $ 1.5543 a pound, a high for the contract. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said the single-biggest development Tuesday was a report that a regional court near the key <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> affirmed the legality of the strike that began Dec. 13. But several other factors were underpinning coffee's dramatic rise in recent days. `` There is concern about the production outlook ... insufficient rain in some parts of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> -LRB- the world's largest producer -RRB- and too much in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` And when you put those together, and then consider that the court decision leaves the workers under less pressure to settle quickly,'' he added, `` you've got the kind of explosive market we saw today.'' Cocoa, meanwhile, was up $ 58 to $ 82 a ton, with March at $ 1,524. `` It was the biggest day for cocoa in ages,'' said <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>. `` There was psychological spillover from the coffee pit and the port strike has some impact there too.'' `` And,'' he added, `` there is some indication the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> -LRB- the world's leading cocoa producer -RRB- is going to tighten supply by removing some from the market.'' Platinum climbed as high as $ 15 an ounce before settling $ 5 to $ 6.50 an ounce higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The December contract closed at $ 535.80 _ a steep decline from the $ 600 level the precious metal topped last week before <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it had developed an automotive catalytic converter that did not require the use of platinum. `` People are coming back to platinum, but there are no bets how this will go until we get a complete story,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronowitz </PERSON>, vice president and director of futures research for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` How much will this actually cut demand? Will General Motors and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> follow suit? Those are questions we wo n't know answers to for a while,'' he added. `` But the worst may be over.'' The rest of the precious metals were quiet. Gold settled 40 cents to 50 cents lower at the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, with December at $ 414 a troy ounce; silver 1.7 cents to 2.1 cents lower, with December at $ 6.093 a troy ounce. Copper was .90 cent lower to 3.15 cents higher, with December at $ 1.5890 a pound. Crude oil futures at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose only by 10 cents to 38 cents _ except for the spot contract in January, which jumped $ 1.42 to $ 17.73 a barrel jump, The spot-month aberration resulted because a brokerage firm, rumored to be part of grain giant <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had sold the market short _ expecting a drop in prices _ and was forced to buy contracts to fulfill obligations on delivery day. `` Somebody got caught between tornadoes,'' said energy analyst who declined to be identified, `` and had to buy like crazy. It seems to happen every time delivery day comes along.'' Heating oil settled 0.47 cent to 0.72 cent higher, with January at 51.47 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was up 0.13 cent to 0.35 cent, with January at 45.55 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices posted across-the-board losses on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower, with December at $ 4.34 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.67 a bushel; oats were 4 \ cents to 5 cents lower, with December at $ 2.21 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -RCB- cents to 7 cents lower, with January at $ 7.86 -LCB- a bushel Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .08 cent higher, with December at 73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with January at 83.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to 1.10 cents higher, with December at 45.74 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .37 cent higher, with February at 45.52 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Reports Second Quarter Earnings Decline; Smith To Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its profit fell 38 percent in its second quarter and 10 percent for the first half of its fiscal year due to the costs of its unsuccessful battle against hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said its net income in the three months ended Nov. 30 totaled $ 44.8 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $ 72.5 million, or 84 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Sales rose to $ 1.75 billion from $ 1.69 billion. The food and restaurant company agreed Sunday to accept a sweetened $ 5.68 billion takeover bid from the British conglomerate, which had made its first offer on Oct. 4. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said the profit decline was `` due to a substantial one-time investment in the Burger King advertising fund and the cost of responding'' to Grand Met's takeover bid. The Burger King investment reduced net earnings by $ 14.4 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter, while after-tax costs related to the tender offer totaled $ 13.2 million, or 15 cents per share, the company said. Operating profit for restaurants fell to $ 4.2 million in the quarter from $ 47.6 million a year ago. Included in the latest quarter's results was a one-time investment of $ 23.4 million to reduce the deficit in Burger King's advertising fund. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s foods businesses reported operating profit of $ 132.8 million for the quarter, a 16 percent gain from the year-earlier period. For the six months, the company's net earnings were $ 116.2 million, or $ 1.35 per share, vs. $ 129.3 million, or $ 1.50 per share, during the comparable period last year. Sales rose to $ 3.23 billion from $ 3.14 billion last year. For the six months, foods operating profit increased 25 percent to $ 211 million, while restaurants operating profit fell by 56.3 percent to $ 52.9 million. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he would leave the company after Grand Met completes the buyout sometime this winter. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 54, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, became <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s president, chairman, and chief executive officer Aug. 1. `` There is n't a CEO -LRB- chief executive officer -RRB- I know that would n't rather be running an independent company,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` I felt there were significant opportunities in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, and my regret is that I wo n't be able to bring those about.'' After months of resistance, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors approved the buyout on Sunday after a judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> on Friday blocked its two key takeover defenses, a `` poison pill'' stock issue plan and the proposed spinoff of Miami-based Burger King. Grand Met will purchase all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> common stock for $ 66 per share in cash under an offer that expires Jan. 3. Grand Met is a British real estate, liquor and gambling conglomerate. Its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings include <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> dog food and Pearle Vision Centers.

 A federal investigation of fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> rug shampooing company continues despite the conviction of owner <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> and his accountant, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said Tuesday. Investors in the company and other victims of its scams are unlikely to get back any of the $ 65 million to $ 70 million that disappeared into the firm, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> told a news conference. `` It's a sad fact that in many of these fraud cases, there is n't much left when it is all over,'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said `` Certainly much of it was dissipated on the lifestyle that Mr. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> led.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, 22, became familiar to millions of people through appearances in television ads and talk shows, portraying himself to the public and the investment community as a teen-age supersalesman whose thriving company began in his parents' garage in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. He was convicted last week of 57 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and credit card fraud. Jurors rejected his defense that Mafia figures had forced him to swindle investors by falsely claiming his company was making a fortune restoring fire - and water-damaged buildings <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s accountant, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>, 52, was convicted Monday of taking a bribe from <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> to cover up the fraud. Ten others connected with ZZZZ Best have pleaded guilty to various charges since the firm collapsed in July 1987. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said his office, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were following leads that surfaced at the trial, including <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s claims that he was forced into crime by mobsters who had interests in his company `` The full range of individuals who may have participated ... is going to be looked into,'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. `` We're not ruling out _ I ca n't say that none of these figures have ties to organized crime.'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> and other officials at the news conference refused to say who was under investigation, when charges might be forthcoming or even if they were sure they would amass enough evidence for further charges. Possible crimes connected with ZZZZ Best include tax fraud, bank fraud and securities fraud through manipulation of the company's stock price, <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said The officials refused to comment on whether <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> had discussed helping in the investigation in return for a reduction in his sentence, which could be a maximum of 403 years. Asked to comment on accusations by <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> that ZZZZ Best may have laundered money for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> mobsters, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said that aspect of the case was in the hands of local authorities. `` There's certainly some smoke there,'' he said. The Police Department's top spokesman, Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, said this week that investigation continues. One of the prosecutors, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON>, said that of the $ 65 million to $ 70 million believed invested in or paid to ZZZZ Best, most seems to have been spent by the high-living <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> and other defendants. Virtually none appears to be available for restitution to investors, bankers, brokers and other victims, whom <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> numbered in the thousands, <PERSON> Asperger </PERSON> said.

 As its own 100th birthday approaches, the song `` Happy Birthday to You'' is about to change owners.

Altogether, <ORGANIZATION> Birchtree </ORGANIZATION> owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700 are actively collecting royalty fees. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, the world's largest music publisher, already owns the rights to songs by <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, among others `` Happy Birthday,'' which is said to generate about $ 1 million in royalties, is one of the three most popular songs in the English language, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The others are `` <ORGANIZATION> Auld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syne </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary has agreed to pay $ 8.95 million to settle a state complaint that it improperly stored hazardous wastes at its <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> facility, state officials said Tuesday. Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> and state Health Director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> called the settlement the largest ever reached under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s hazardous waste law and possibly the biggest of its kind in the country. `` The severity of the penalties imposed in this case are matched by the seriousness of the violations and by the potential threat to public health and safety,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said at a Capitol news conference. He said state investigators found about 5,000 steel drums containing hazardous waste at the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> facility in northwest <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>. About 2,000 of the drums were leaking, corroded or open and more than 3,000 of them were not labeled, he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> said they had no indication that the waste had leaked into groundwater, but <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said the situation at the refinery could have been disasterous if there was a fire. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said the waste posed `` no significant risk to either our employees, the environment or the community.'' They said the company agreed to the settlement to avoid the costs of fighting the case in court. `` While technically hazardous waste, the vast majority of the materials were relatively inert and would not be considered to be hazardous outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Furthermore, procedures exist in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> regulations under which <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> could have sought and, we are confident, obtained approvals from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to treat most of the material involved as non-hazardous.'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresnick </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, said most of the material stored in the drums already was there when <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> purchased property next to its facility from <ORGANIZATION> Tosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Most of the drums have been removed, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The company is required to remove the remaining drums within 90 days, state officials said. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 4.5 million in civil penalties, $ 500,000 to cover administrative and investigative costs and at least $ 3.95 million to reduce waste production and improve waste handling procedures at its facilities. <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> said the violations found by state inspectors included storing waste for longer than allowed without a permit, storing incompatible wastes next to each other, storing waste in unlabeled containers, and storing waste in open and unsafe conditions. According to the complaint, the department first found improper storage of waste at the site during a partial inspection in September 1986. The complaint was filed last week.

 Inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3 percent last month and economic growth did the same in the third quarter, the government said Tuesday in reports that eased fears an overheating economy is about to trigger a wage-price spiral. Seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose just 0.25 percent in November compared with a 0.4 percent increase in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Before the seasonal adjustments, prices rose only 0.1 percent. The monthly inflation figure was rounded off in the department's announcement to 0.3 percent although the actual figure was 0.25 percent Clothing prices that had jumped 4 percent in September and October with the introduction of fall and winter fashions dipped 0.3 percent last month. And food prices showed no increase in November for the first time since February. Analysts who had been seeing harbingers of inflation everywhere in recent economic data described as `` amazing'' and `` remarkable'' the continued lack of it in the government's monthly report on the Consumer Price Index. The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 percent for the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the first 11 months, the same as it was for all of 1987. With only December left, another month similar to November could enable the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to finish its last year in office meeting its inflation target of 4.3 percent for 1988. `` It's amazing,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. `` We've gone six years into an expansion and have the lowest unemployment in 14 years and there's no sign of inflation, at least at the consumer level.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said inflation grew by about one-half percentage point in late 1987 but `` has hung there ever since.'' `` It's rather remarkable when you consider that capacity utilization in factories is up and the labor market has gotten tighter,'' he said. `` But there it is: inflation is stalled out.'' Meanwhile Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the non-farm economy grew at an annual rate of only 3 percent in the third quarter compared with what was generally acknowledged as an overheated rate of 3.9 percent last spring. The effects of the drought, however, limited overall GNP growth to 2.5 percent, in line with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s non-inflationary growth target of 2 percent to 2.5 percent Preliminary reports had put the annual non-farm growth rate at 3.2 percent and total GNP growth at 2.6 percent in the third quarter. Economists said the downward revisions were due primarily to larger declines in government spending and the drought having less overall impact than previously believed. Corporate profits before taxes rose 2.6 percent in the July-September quarter to $ 313.9 billion, following 6.9 percent jump in the second quarter. After taxes, corporations reported their profits rising 3.9 percent in the third quarter compared with 8.9 percent last spring. `` With productivity growth slowing, the big profit increases in the economy are over,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` Higher unit labor costs are squeezing profit margins.'' But those higher labor costs are not finding their way into workers' wallets. Average weekly earnings of $ 327.92 last month, after adjusting for November's inflation, dropped 0.8 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In terms of buying power, workers are making 1 percent less than they did a year ago, the department said. The November increases raised the Consumer Price Index to 120.3, meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing $ 100 in a 1982-84 base period would have cost $ 120.30 last month, a dime more than in October and $ 4.40 more than in November 1987. Housing and shelter costs, including residential rents, rose 0.3 percent in November, the same pace they have maintained over the past nine months. Natural gas and electric rates were up 1.8 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, from October, more than offsetting a 2 percent drop in prices for home heating oil, the government said. The November decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil, now priced 10.8 percent below where it was last spring. Seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from October, remaining 0.2 percent less than they were at the end of last year and 28.1 percent below their peak level of March 1981. Consumer prices for items other than food, shelter and energy rose an average 0.2 percent in November after jumping 0.7 percent in October. New-car prices, which has risen more than one percentage point in Spetember and October, declined by 0.2 percent last month in reflect the introduction of rebates on some of the new 1989 models. However, auto financing and insurance costs continued to advance dramatically, with the former up 1.5 percent and the latter 0.9 percent above October. Airline fares also jumped by 1.1 percent. Medical costs, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent last month and are up at an annual rate of 7 percent so far this year.

 Here are Tuesday's economic reports from the federal government.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Inflation:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Inflation slowed in November to an annual rate of 3 percent as clothing prices fell and food stabilized. The Consumer Price Index, after seasonal adjustment, rose 0.25 percent. That followed a 0.4 percent gain in October. The new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 4.6 percent for the first 10 months of the year to 4.4 percent for the first 11 months. Another month similar to November could enable the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to leave office on target for inflation of 4.3 percent for 1988.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Gross National Product:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The summer's drought held the gross national product to a moderate 2.5 percent annual growth in the July-September quarter. Growth in the GNP, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed from 3.0 percent in the second quarter and 3.4 percent in the first quarter. The drought knocked $ 12.3 billion off the GNP, which was $ 4.01 trillion on an annual basis, adjusted for inflation and season. Excluding the drought, the GNP grew 3.9 percent in the second quarter and 3.0 percent in the third.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Corporate Profits:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations reported that third-quarter profits rose $ 6.4 billion or 3.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual $ 169.1 billion. That was down from a robust 8.9 percent increase in the second quarter. Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.5 percent to $ 105.7 billion in the third quarter, compared with a 1.8 percent gain in the second quarter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Weekly Earnings:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, plunged 0.8 percent in November after jumping 0.7 percent in October. The November decline stemmed from a 0.6 percent drop in the number of hours worked and a 0.1 percent decline in average earnings per hour, the first drop since February. Together, the drops more than offset a 0.2 percent increase in prices as measured by a special index for urban wage earners. Average weekly earnings in November, before adjusting for inflation, were $ 327.92, only 3.2 percent higher than a year ago. Taking the 4.1 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 12 months, real weekly earnings are 1 percent lower than a year ago.
