 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recalled all its ambassadors from European Common Market nations Tuesday and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled an Iranian envoy as the diplomatic battle grew over <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he supported the retaliatory moves by the European countries. However offensive <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, `` The Satanic Verses,'' may be to Moslems, `` inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted existing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and said: `` I do n't know where we'll go from there.'' In <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is withdrawing its charge d'affaires from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for consultations on the death threats issue, but is leaving one diplomatic representative in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s diplomatic recall was in response to Monday's decision by the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw their envoys from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for consultations Iranian parliament speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> move `` a big mistake.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> decision ... is a clear sign which proves claims that the issue of this blasphemous book ... is a plot designed by Western imperialism to fight true Islam,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` We do not fear such threats. ... We are prepared to follow our own path at a cost,'' said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. The confrontation over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> appeared to be eroding efforts by some Iranian officials, including <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, to strengthen ties with more nations despite opposition by fundamentalist hard-liners. Although <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was not quoted as endorsing the death sentence, his comments indicated Iranian leaders were closing ranks in the face of retaliation for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death call. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> ally, said Friday that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> might be pardoned if he repented and apologized. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a Moslem himself, apologized the next day, but <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ignored the overture and renewed the death threat. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, said Tuesday that although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stood by its statements on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, it had not dispatched death squads to kill the author. `` We have not closed the door on negotiations nor have we opened the door for confrontation,'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to spare the lives of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers. The 41-year-old Indian-born author has been in hiding with his wife in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where he lives. The Common Market nations stoppe short of breaking relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but said that in addition to recalling top diplomats, they would suspend high-level visits to and from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a market member, went a step further by recalling its entire embassy staff. On Tuesday, it announced it was expelling the Iranian charge d'affaires and his aide. `` It is neither possible nor sensible to conduct a normal relationship with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> followed the Common Market and recalled their ambassadors, and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> threatened to cancel a trade mission to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> next month unless the death warrant were rescinded. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> summoned the Iranian ambassadors to their nations to express disapproval of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s actions. Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by portraying the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God. The novel was met with critical acclaim when <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> published the 547-page book in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September. It was not until last week, on the eve of its publication in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered Moslems to track down <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and kill him. Publishers in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> then canceled plans to publish the book. Bookstores in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and many in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulled the novel from their shelves. Many independent booksellers continued to stock the novel, however. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that based on last week's sales `` The Satanic Verses'' will be listed as the second best-selling hardcover fiction book in the March 5 issue of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. A full-page advertisement Wednesday in the Times announcing publication of the book proclaimed: `` Free people write books, free people publish books, free people sell books, free people buy books, free people read books.'' The ad was signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In a letter Tuesday to Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the more than 500 authors in the French chapter of the international <ORGANIZATION> Pen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> called for publication of `` The Satanic Verses'' and said they were confident authorities could assure the publishers' safety. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, internationally acclaimed novelist <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON> said a group of 24 writers will publish the book under an agreement with the publisher, which said last week it feared for its employees. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> stopped printing excerpts from the novel after anonymous callers threatened `` violent reprisals,'' according to a newspaper employee who spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Israeli lawmaker <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flatto-Sharon </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to stay in his 27-room home in a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb, and offered to buy the rights to the novel in the countries where publishers have balked. `` We have a lot of problems here but security is not one of them,'' <PERSON> Flatto-Sharon </PERSON> said. In the British <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, Lord <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> raised the possibility of a nuclear strike against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> were murdered. `` Is there nothing we can do when the ayatollah is going around saying ` who's afraid of the big bad bomb?''' he asked. Speaking for the government, Lord <PERSON> Trefgarne </PERSON> replied: `` We seek an improvement in our relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and not a descent to the jungle.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishtmand </PERSON>, a ranking member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo and a hard-liner, Tuesday took over many of the duties of prime minister, government sources said. Moslem guerrillas, meanwhile, fired a salvo of rockets into the Afghan capital, killing one person and injuring three others on the ninth anniversary of an uprising against the Soviet-backed government. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> stepped down as prime minister Monday, and a 21-member <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> took power. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kishtmand </PERSON>, who served as prime minister for seven years until May 1988, is in charge of supervising the government's council of ministers. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonyumity, said this means the 52-year-old Kishtmand will effectively be the prime minister. The return to power of of <LOCATION> Kishtmand </LOCATION>, the only prominent Shiite Moslem in President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government, is seen as another move by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> to consolidate the power of his communist government. Shiites make up only 17 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s population, but they account for about 40 percent of the refugees from which many of the guerrillas are drawn. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> appointed <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION>, a non-communist, as prime minister last May in an unsucessful bid to seek a power-sharing agreement with the Moslem guerrillas. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a committee of Afghan field commanders and scholars sought to reach a consensus Tuesday on the makeup of an interim government for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. More than 400 delegates to a special Afghan council or `` shura'' canceled Tuesday's session while the committee wrestled with a blueprint for a provisional government. The commanders and scholars took over the job of nominating an interim government after guerrilla leaders, paralyzed by differences between moderates and fundamentalists, failed to break a deadlock Monday. The guerrillas' rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was the first since Thursday, when at least seven people were killed. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the fatal rocket in Tuesday's assault hit near a government refugee office in northern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Three other rockets hit southeastern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but there were no reports of casualties. The guerrillas hold most of the countryside and are trying to close in on the cities, which mainly are held by government troops. At the headquarters of the secret police, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> displayed a huge cache of arms and explosives and said the guerrillas had planned to use them Tuesday to attack buildings and bazaars. Many had markings from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Officials said others were made in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the most powerful guerrilla groups are based. <PERSON> Moammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, a state security agent, said the weapons were seized Monday in a well in eastern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Business was brisk at some shops in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Tuesday, but others were closed to mark the anniversary of the anti-Soviet uprising. The 1980 revolt occurred two months after Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to bolster a Marxist government. Soviet soldiers fired on Moslem protesters who emerged from their homes shouting `` God is Great!'' Dozens of people were reported killed. Among the weapons displayed by the government were plastic explosives that agents said came from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Chinese-made hand grenades, British mortar shells, Egyptian rockets, Italian fuses for mines, Swedish circuit testers and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rifles. There also were political pamphlets. One, printed in English and the local language <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION>, said: `` We will contine our Jihad -LRB- holy war -RRB- until the withdrawal of the last Soviet soldier.'' The final Soviet troops, once estimated at more than 100,000 in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, withdrew last Wednesday under a U.N.-mediated accord. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared a state of emergency and shook up his government to consolidate control. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Tuesday, an investigator appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said both sides in the civil war continue to violate the human rights of Afghans. Austrian law professor <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Ermacora </PERSON> said reliable reports suggest dfghan police still widely use torture and mistreatment as part of interrogations. His report also listed alleged incidents, cited by `` a variety of corroborating sources,'' in which rebels had killed more than 100 Afghan soldiers and civilians since September.

<HEAD>Massive Conversion of Grain to ``Gasohol'' Still a Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The old dream of wiping out grain surpluses by turning corn into fuel-grade alcohol is a long way from coming true, but progress continues, according to industry and farm officials. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for example, says ethanol blends will be introduced this fall in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, area to comply with the state's new clean air law. Blended fuels, basically 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline, are said to cut automobile carbon monoxide emissions by as much as 25 percent. Another alternative is petroleum-based MTBE, or methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether, which can reduce emissions by 10 percent. The corn producers said <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> initiated the nation's first fuels program using ethanol and MTBE blends a year ago and that `` the success of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> program was instrumental'' in passage of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s clean air law. An estimated 340 million bushels of corn were used to produce 800 million gallons of ethanol for fuel blending last year, with blends representing 8 percent of all gasoline sales in 1988, the association said. The Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade association representing the ethanol industry, said more than 8.4 billion gallons of ethanol-gasoline blends were sold in 42 states last year. The association said more than 60 ethanol plants are operating in 23 states, representing a private investment of more than $ 2.5 billion. Ethanol use in gasoline to make `` gasohol'' was spurred by the second oil embargo by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries in the late 1970s, the association said, and by a rush of subsidies from the federal and state governments. The fervor at the time also prompted hopes that burdensome grain surpluses could be used as feed stock, thus bolstering the nation's farm economy as well as contributing to the fuel supply `` What is even more significant is that this superior record of growth has been sustained through good economic conditions and bad,'' the association said. `` This past year, unusually high grain prices caused by the drought and near-record low oil prices threatened to severely weaken this industry.'' But while three plants were forced to shut down temporarily, `` little production capacity was lost and sales have remained quite strong.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not viewed ethanol possibilities with the enthusiasm of the corn and industry associations. There are economic problems that wo n't go away simply because ethanol sounds like a good idea, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Ethanol gained support as it also promised environmental benefits and new markets and uses for corn and other surplus crops,'' the agency said in a recent background paper. `` But the sense of urgency over the need to develop alternative fuels dissipated as petroleum prices declined.'' But public attention once again is being drawn to alcohol fuels to help reduce pollution, ease dependence on foreign oil and to provide a greater market for farm crops. `` Compliance deadlines of the Clean Air Act passed and the standards are still unmet,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum imports have increased to the high levels of the early 1970s.'' As to the future, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts said ethanol's success will depend on energy, environmental, agricultural and trade policies. Those are factors that will determine the prices, costs and competitiveness of the ethanol industry. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fuel ethanol industry was created by a mix of federal and state subsidies, loan programs and other incentives,'' the report said. A handful of large plants produce most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ethanol, the report said. The eight largest, owned by five companies, accounted for nearly 75 percent of the operating capacity in 1986. `` Ethanol is exempt from 6 cents of the 9-cent -LRB- federal excise -RRB- tax through September 1993,'' the report said. `` At the 10 percent blending rate ... that exemption is effectively a 60-cent-per-gallon subsidy. Many states provide similar financial incentives averaging 20 to 30 cents per gallon.'' The federal government also helps with loan guarantees to encourage plant construction, but `` most of these plants have not been successful,'' the report said. Only one of the three plants with loans guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was operating and paying off its loans by early 1988. At <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said loan guarantees for 11 plants were initially obligated but that only three are currently in operation. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said FmHA has made no ethanol loans since 1984 and that the maximum had been reduced by half, from $ 20 billion per plant to $ 10 million. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> background report said the production of ethanol so far has `` not significantly affected income for farmers participating in government commodity programs. `` Moderate levels of ethanol production would only slightly affect total farm revenue and income,'' the report said. `` It is unlikely that modest increases in ethanol production would drive market prices for corn to exceed current target price levels -LRB- in the federal commodity programs -RRB- within the next 8 to 10 years.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-American protesters are challenging <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s policies toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sparking more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism here than at any time in four decades. From student radicals yelling `` Yankee Go Home'' to farmers denouncing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture imports, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> are venting their frustration and anger at one of their oldest allies. When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> next Monday, he will find what one newspaper warns is a society `` quite different'' from the one he saw as vice president in April 1982. `` Do n't Come to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>!'' yell radical students, punctuating the words with raised, clenched fists. Criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is no longer relegated to private conversation. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags are torched and effigies of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are burned. Some 12,000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police with clubs and firebombs outside the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> this month and denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trying to force open <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s agricultural market Radical students staged a series of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities to demand an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence. They vowed to hold nationwide anti-government, anti-U.S. demonstrations to coincide with the president's visit. `` Arson, violence, destruction and lawlessness can not be tolerated,'' said President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> in demanding an end to protests. Every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president since the Korean War except <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> but none has come during a time of more public animosity against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policies. Businessmen, laborers, and students who have never thrown a firebomb are heard to complain that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is victimized by unfair trade pressures and rude, <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> arrogance. When asked their nationality by a Korean, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens rarely acknowledge that they are American. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing which labels them from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is no longer a sacred cow,'' said a western diplomat, requesting anonymity.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is no longer the patron saint of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has played roles in past dictatorial governments and we oppose the visit of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' claims a labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and human rights abuses of the past U.S.-supported authoritarian government. A few weeks ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it was considering closing its cultural center in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, because of repeated violent attacks and concern for the safety of its staff. <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> was the scene of a bloody nine-day civil uprising in 1980. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shared responsibility for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident by acquiescing in a military-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government plan to quell the uprising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denied the charge. Although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact on relations and radicals have little public support, government leaders warn that growing anti-American sentiment could endanger <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s interests in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The government lost no time in apologizing publicly for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center attacks and appealed to radical students `` not to damage traditional Korea-U. friendship.'' The assistant foreign minister, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Suk-kyu </PERSON>, reflects the thinking of many when he says anti-Americanism `` is a minority view and a passing phenomenon, despite loud voices and anti-American activists.'' More than half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40 million people have been born since the Korean War ended 35 years ago, and long time observers link the intensity of anti-American feeling to the age of the participant. The younger the person, the more likely he or she is to feel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken its relationship with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for granted. The Korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist south and the communist north since the end of World War II in 1945. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fight the 1950-53 Korean War against the north and keeps 42,000 troops stationed in the south under a mutual defense pact. Radical students and dissidents feel the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stand in the way of unification talks with the north and have demanded the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. They also demand the halt to this year's joint <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> military exercises called `` Team Spirit.'' A more realistic relationship is needed between the two governments, say both protesters and some politicians, a relationship which recognizes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s economic potential and place in global politics. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s leading trade partner. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sold <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> goods worth $ 8 billion more than it bought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Considerable pressure has been placed on the Koreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance the deficit. Anti-American comment became acceptable socially after last fall's Olympic Games when South Koreans of all ages had their frustration and resentment against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stoked by what they regarded as unruly behavior of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> athletes and biased coverage by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Part II: Economic Reform Comes Hard In Populist Louisiana</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
 When the oil and the good times were flowing, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s populist system of government seemed to make sense. Give the people a free ride and let the businesses pay. Now oil has crashed, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has suffered through four years of economic depression, and economists say recovery is n't possible without a new system. A reformist governor is trying to do just that, but breaking with the populist past does n't come easy.

 The 34-story <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state capitol casts a long shadow over the white marble statue of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, but these days, it seems the statue is casting the longer shadow. `` An unconquered friend of the poor,'' the inscription on Long's adjacent tomb says, `` who dreamed of the day when the wealth of the land would be spread among the people. The populist ideas of `` the Kingfish,'' who governed from 1928-1932, still influence the fiscal structure of the state. Spread the wealth, protect the poor. Homeowners receive a $ 75,000 property tax exemption, making the average home tax free. Automobile license plates cost only $ 3 a year. City councils ca n't raise taxes without a vote of the people. Businesses bear much of the burden through taxes and fees. But the way of doing business that <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> helped build is crippling the state now, economists say. Without the oil windfall, state and local budgets ca n't be balanced. Schools and hospitals are suffering. Unemployment has soared. And new businesses are scared away by the tax structure. `` It's ironic. What is supposed to be good for the people now acts to their detriment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Added business leader <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' World Trade Center: `` We've got to change We can not do business in the old ways. ... Painful as it is, it's forced us to wake up.'' But waking up is n't easy in the land of `` The Big Easy,'' as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is called. After a string of legislative victories and a fierce round of budget cutting and borrowing, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s initial attempt at overhauling the tax structure failed in the state House. The Harvard-educated conservative Democrat has, in his own words, `` poked every bear in the forest'' while inciting a revolution in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. He won education reform, campaign finance reform, tort reform, worker's compensation reform, even unemployment insurance reform. But when it came to fiscal reform, when it came to dismantling the last vestiges of the populist past, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> lost. Ca n't a family's home be the one thing that's not taxed, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s opponents asked `` I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> tradition,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` It does n't come easy.'' Along the way, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is also compiling a spectrum of political enemies ranging from populists to labor unions to teachers. Public opinion polls are divided on the maverick reformer. The question remains, what happens if he ca n't complete the revolution? `` It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> ... a wasteland, a welfare state,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said, adding that people with the means to move away would do so. Politicians, he said, `` are beginning to realize that.'' Fiscal reform has become the vortex of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s struggle to climb out of a depression that began when the price of oil fell by more than half in 1984-85. Tens of thousands lost jobs, and both businesses and workers left the state. And taxes on oil _ which used to account for 40 percent of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state budget _ plummeted. The state, long known for its big spending ways, had n't put anything aside for dry years. It had n't spent much on developing a strong economic base, outside of oil. In fact, it had n't even had a balanced budget in the 1980s until <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> took office 10 months ago _ even though it has a balanced budget law. It's debt reached $ 2 billion. `` We could not make the payroll the week after I took office,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. Now, state promoters, planners and business leaders all buzz with talk about <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s recovery _ if there is fiscal reform. `` When the price of oil was $ 40 a barrel, hardly anybody worried,'' said <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, the businessman who chaired a governor's task force on labor `` Having all these advantages made everyone in the state very lazy. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has not been competitive in business,'' <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> said. `` It's only really now that the state is pulling its act together.'' The day after reform failed last October, two companies considering <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> announced plans to build in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Other businesses considering a relocation or expansion in the Bayou State are holding off until they see if reform passes, said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s chief of economic development, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> Wall Street bond brokers set out informal guidelines for what would be necessary to raise the state's bond rating, currently just one notch above junk bonds. Low bond ratings means the state must pay higher interest on its debt. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has accomplished all but one item _ fiscal reform, said his chief of staff, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. `` They watch us very closely,'' he said. The battle will probably be waged this spring when <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> comes back to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> with a plan. Last time, his package passed the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but came up 10 votes short of the necessary two-thirds margin in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition focused on <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan to cut by two-thirds the $ 75,000 homestead exemption _ the nation's highest. It was led by a county tax assessor, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chehardy </PERSON>, who saw reform as an attempt to raise taxes and cripple the average homeowner. `` People in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> read horror stories in other states where property taxes did go wild,'' said <PERSON> Chehardy </PERSON>. `` Government taxes everything. Ca n't there be one thing in life a person can have without being taxed?'' <PERSON> Chehardy </PERSON> says lawmakers should cut the budget, and if there are any tax increases, taxpayers should get a chance to vote. But <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and his top aides insist the budget has been cut so much _ more than $ 500 million _ that further reductions could cripple the state. Already, they worry about the declining quality of care at state-financed charity hospitals and the ability of cities like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to get by without the traditional state support. And the next fiscal year budget has a projected deficit of $ 734 million. The total budget is $ 4.2 billion, but only $ 2.2 billion is discretionary spending _ money that is n't tied to court orders or debt payments. `` Cutting that much -LRB- $ 734 million -RRB- would shut more and more hospitals, cut transportation money and higher education,'' said Commissioner of Administration <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. `` That is, in my mind, shutting down government.'' Still, the early talk of next June's budget is a revolutionary concept by itself in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a state that at times balanced its budget for only three-quarters of the year and hoped oil prices would go up.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, the lawyer prosecuting <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the Iran-Contra trial, has a reputation for intuitively making the right move in a courtroom. In a civil lawsuit, lawyers for a bank abruptly asked one of <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s clients whether he would waive the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality. Reacting to the unorthodox request, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> quickly said his client _ an investor who alleged he had been defrauded _ would agree to a waiver if the bank was willing to waive the same privilege covering conversations with its attorneys. The bank backed down. Representing an insurance company accused of overcharging its customers, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> on cross-examination asked an expert witness to select from a stock of well over 100 files the one he considered to be the most egregious example of overcharging. Robert A. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nest </PERSON>, a partner in <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> law firm, recalls that <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> spent a minute familiarizing himself with the contents of the file selected by the expert and `` then proceeded to tear the witness apart.'' `` Two things about <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nest </PERSON>, his tenacity and his intuition. `` He does n't let a point drop. He will fight all the way to whatever is there. `` He's remarkably intuitively skilled in a courtroom. It's a great athlete's intuition, to know where the ball is and where everything is on the field. <PERSON> John </PERSON> has that kind of intuition. He has an ability to respond to the evidence.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s ability `` to kind of sense where the witness is going'' is `` a rare skill in today's lawyer,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nest </PERSON>. `` So many of us take deposition after deposition and there's nothing to predict.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s weaker points? `` He has as many weaknesses as the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nest </PERSON>. The North case will be <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s first as a prosecutor, but his abilities as a defense lawyer translate easily to the other side of the courtroom, says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for the northern district of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` He's always been aggressive and he can bring that aggression to the prosecution side,'' said <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>. `` He's aware of the moves of a defense lawyer, having been one himself.'' In short, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> `` can try a case there's no doubt about that,'' said <PERSON> McGivern </PERSON>, who as a prosecutor has been involved in several cases in which <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> has been a defense attorney. A Vietnam War veteran who served in the Marines and was wounded in combat, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a founding partner of <ORGANIZATION> Keker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Brockett </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He has successfully defended movie maker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> in a civil lawsuit and won a case in which his client, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> society figure and architect, was accused of vehicular manslaughter. After the Iran-Contra affair erupted in 1986, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> sought work with independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> felt there was an important lesson here for Americans who care about the democratic process and he was intent in participating in the investigation for that reason,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nest </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nest </PERSON> said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> had concerns that those involved appeared to have been `` hiding the ball, running foreign policy without the consent of representatives of the people.'' `` The political and legal implications struck me as enormous,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said of the Iran-Contra episode in an interview last year with The Los Angeles Times. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, 45, has more than 15 years as a trial lawyer and relishes the role. `` When you go to court,'' he told the Times, `` you get a chance to be a hero, which is a thing that most people repress the desire for. You also get a chance to fail enormously. `` That sort of edge is something that people who are trial lawyers usually like. You get a chance to do the right thing. You get a chance to do it in a stylish way.''

<HEAD>Agency Calls for Reshaping of Aid Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal foreign aid agency says the time has come for a radical reshaping of the way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> allocates the billions of dollars a year it passes out to other nations. The recommendation was contained in a 158-page report issued Monday by the administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` The challenges of today's problems, and tomorrow's, can not be met with yesterday's solutions, suitable as they may have been to yesterday's problems,'' the report said. The study, which made no specific recommendations for policy changes, said the aid program no longer seems able to fulfill its original mandate of helping poor countries achieve the transition from dependency to self-sufficiency. Somewhere between 1949 and the present, the original concept of aid as a transitional means of helping countries become self-sufficient has been lost, it said. `` Is today's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid fostering healthy development towards independent prosperity _ or simply postponing the day of reckoning for governments unwilling or unable to take the politically painful steps needed for their own development?'' the report asked. `` All too often, dependency seems to have won out over development,'' the report said. A principal conclusion calls for `` radically reshaping'' future official assistance programs to face new realities and to coordinate government assistance with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> private sector involvement in providing humanitarian aid, education and overseas investment. This reshaping `` must be both an immediate concern and a major long-term national priority. Nothing less will serve the national interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the report said. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> noted in comments to a group of reporters that no country has `` graduated'' from less developed to developed status in the past 20 years. All this is in sharp contrast to the Marshall Plan of the late 1940's and early 1950's when an ambitious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program helped put <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on its feet and then was terminated. One problem highlighted by the report is that `` succeeding Congresses and administrations, prodded by the dominant crises _ and interest groups _ of the moment, have piled differing and often conflicting foreign assistance objectives on top of each other.'' This `` dizzying'' array ranges from winning friends for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to alleviating poverty, to countering the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and to finding markets for American farm products, the report said. In a December speech, Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., a member of a bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force on foreign aid, said the 33 separate statutory objectives for foreign assistance `` are so numerous that they do not provide meaningful direction. `` All of these 33 objectives may be worthy. I probably voted for most of them. ... However, a program that pursues all objectives risks accomplishing none of them,'' he said. Complicating fulfillment of these objectives has been a decline in the amount of aid appropriated from $ 19 billion in 1985 to $ 14 billion this year, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. The Woods report suggested that developmental success has less to do with foreign aid levels than with the internal policies of recipient countries. `` Where development has worked, and is working, the key has been economic growth,'' it said. `` And this is largely the result of the individual nations making the right policy choices and making the most of their internal human and material resources.'' The report said growth-oriented policies `` are a constant among success cases, regardless of the level of aid they have received _ which are sometimes greater and sometimes less than the levels received by developmental laggards.'' It said the `` impressive development of first <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and later <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is proof positive that the right donor program and guidance, when matched by the right recipient policies, can result in a smooth transition from dependence to self-sufficiency.''

 Since taking office in May, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has balanced a state budget for the first time in the 1980s. He's steered a package of reforms through the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, including political campaign reform and education reform. Yet he lost his most important battle _ overhauling the state's populist taxing structure. Here, in excerpts from an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> regional reporter <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> discusses his goals and concerns for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> from his <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, office.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Question: What are you trying to do to this state? It seems like there's a revolution going on. Answer: It really is. ... We inherited the highest unemployment rate in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a budget that was in shambles for a variety of reasons. For example, the price of oil in last year's budget was $ 21 a barrel. Oil never saw $ 21. It was a phony figure which exasperated the deficit. We've got it -LRB- oil, which is currently around $ 17 a barrel -RRB- at $ 13.80. That's how tough we are. ... As a result, I think the business community in the state and outside of the state knows that something's happening in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Our unemployment rate is beginning to go down. It was above 12 percent when I took office. It's now about 9.5. Q: Is it the attitudes in the state that you're bumping up against? A: We had a state, and I love <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, but we had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're trying to reverse it. It's not done. We've got a ways to go. We need to rewrite our tax code to give businesses incentives to grow jobs. I tried ... I failed by a close margin. We'll try it again, and win it. When we do that, all of the ingredients will be in place. ... Watch us. I want to warn <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the other states of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Watch us. Q: Is it fair to say what you're really doing is throwing out the past, throwing out the populist government, throwing out the legacy of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>? A: Right, in part. I want to be fair to <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> because he had many great points. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> built the roads in this state to tie farms to market. He gave children free textbooks. So when we say we're breaking with the past, I really do n't think of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> I do think of the populist strain where there's something for nothing and everybody else pays the bill. We are trying to break from that. ... I believe in paying our own way. That is a break from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> tradition. It does n't come easy. Q: What would happen if tax reform does n't pass? A: It would be more of the same. We'd be a slave to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. We'd be a slave to how many times <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> can get together and jack the price around. We'd be a wasteland, a welfare state. Those who are without hope, those who are without means, wo n't move _ they ca n't, they're stuck. Those with an education, with financial mobility, are going to vote with their feet. They're going to leave. And for the first time the politicians are beginning to realize that. Every bear in the forest, I've poked. Now is the time to do it. There are some who think that if I do my job right, I could never get elected to another public office. Q: Do you believe it? A: Might be true. Q: Do you care? A: I do n't. ... I would be totally satisfied four years from now to prop my feet up on the desk and say, ` Well done.' Q: Do you think things can turn around that quickly? A: Yes, in terms of public perception and attitude. That's the real fight. The fight is not the unemployment rate that goes up and down with national trends and a lot of things out of our control. You'll see an improvement over four years and fairly dramatic. But what needs to turn around is attitude. I found many people in this state who had given up, who felt <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> could not change, who felt that we were a slave to our past, who felt that the populist politicians owned <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. They're beginning to realize now that we are winners. Not me, we. This state's a winner.

 Not so long ago, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy-makers would be concerned about the forthcoming Sino-Soviet summit, the first one in 30 years. But that's no longer the case and the meeting is not likely to blemish President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this weekend. `` If Sino-Soviet rapprochement contributes to the stability of the region and the globe, then it is all to the good,'' said one old <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> hand who is helping plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s scheduled visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May will end the Sino-Soviet rift and highlight Kremlin concessions on the three points the Chinese have said were preventing improved relations for a decade. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiao-peng </PERSON> will be the first Sino-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in 1959. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> later argued over ideology, and Soviet and Chinese troops clashed in the 1960's and 1970's along the 4,670-mile border. The reason the Chinese are welcoming the Soviet leader, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not object, is the marked shift in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> foreign policy in the four years <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been in power, according to scholars and government experts. Before agreeing to meet with the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, the Chinese wanted the Soviets out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and a reduction of Soviet troops along the border. The Kremlin has met or started to meet all of those conditions. The last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last week, ending a bloody and futile nine-year occupation. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a close military ally of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has removed some of the more than 100,000 troops it sent into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and agreed to negotiations over withdrawing the rest. In 1987, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew 12,000 of its troops from <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, on the Chinese border, and last December <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced unspecified further reductions in the estimated 50,000 troops remaining there. The Sino-Soviet summit, in short, derives from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to change Soviet policies and to make friends rather than enemies around the world `` There could be a summit only if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> changed its pattern of behavior from the last two or three decades,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a fellow at the Russian Research Center at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The things that brought the Soviets and the Chinese together are the same things that brought the Soviets and the Americans together,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a specialist on Soviet relations with Asian nations. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> specialist on <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition he not be further identified, noted that `` both the Chinese and the Soviets have stressed that the normalization of their relations will not affect their ties with any other country,'' in other words, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If the Soviets fully meet the conditions laid down by the Chinese, said the government expert, `` that will be a big plus for stability in the region.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, announcing his trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, indicated that the time had passed for the kind of geopolitical maneuver that opened the door of U.S.-Chinese relations in the 1970's, the `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card'' played by then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> against the Kremlin. `` Well, I do n't know what signal it sends in that regard, but let me just remind you that I'm the one who does not believe in ` playing the Soviet card,' or ` playing the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on Jan. 28. The most recent senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last September that `` we think the relaxation of tensions between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be healthy for world peace and stability.'' A report from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> concluded that `` a <LOCATION> Beijing-Moscow </LOCATION> summit need not bode ill for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not necessarily gain if Chinese-Soviet relations remain cool, nor does the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> necessarily lose of those relations improve,'' wrote Heritage analyst <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Brick. Relations between the communist giants has already improved in recent years, noted Brick, and the two are natural trading partners, with similar economies, a long border, and natural resources that the other needs. Under a bilateral trade pact signed in 1985, said <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has become <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fifth largest trading partner, with barter exchange rising from $ 260 billion in 1981 to $ 1.8 billion last year, and expected to reach $ 6 billion by 1990.

<HEAD>More and More Swedes are Calling in Sick</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More and more Swedes are calling in sick from their jobs and authorities say they plan to try to find out if they are faking. Abuses in one of the world's most liberal welfare systems may be costing billions in sick pay. A recent study by the Swedish Employer's <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the average Swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illness in 1987, compared with 18 days in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 16 in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and 11 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of those questioned suspected their colleagues of cheating. Official statistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percent over the past three years. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honor system. Under a 1987 reform, blue-collar workers joined other wage earners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they are off sick, starting from the first day they stay home. The government handles the payments, but most of the money comes from taxes paid by employers. In the Swedish system, an employee who is ill calls his <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and later signs a form stating the nature of the illness. A doctor's certificate is required only if the worker is home for a week or more. One form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick when he's not. However, authorities say it's even more common for workers to file for sick pay and go to work anyway, getting sick pay in addition to regular pay. It's difficult to check. `` If I knock on the door and nobody opens, what is my proof?'' <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroberg </PERSON>, a local official, said recently on Swedish television. She suggested more telephone checks with employers rather than home visits by inspectors. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> described another scheme in a report late last year. It said some people collect payments for sick leave, parental leave and student grants for the same period. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said on television his organization would increase its supervision. In <LOCATION> Bandhagen </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, the local office started a three-week campaign to check all claims on certain days. Sick leave, pensions and various other social benefits are expected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year. Illness benefits last year amounted to $ 5 billion, $ 120 million more than <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> paid for defense. One option under study is to let employers take over sick payments for those absent from work up to two weeks, saving the government money and paperwork. The employer would then claim a refund from the authorities. Unions have opposed the plan. <PERSON> Margareta </PERSON> <PERSON> Svensson </PERSON> at the blue-collar <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> said it would permit employers to put pressure on employees. `` There would be people who would not dare to be -LRB- off -RRB- ill if their employer controlled'' sick payments, she said. Since benefits are administered locally, there is no official overall picture of cheating nationwide. A random check by insurance offices in the west coast town of <LOCATION> Halmstad </LOCATION> indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false, and the figure was 15 percent in neighboring <LOCATION> Varberg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> said. Another study reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said a three-day check of claimants in the northern province of <LOCATION> Jamtland </LOCATION> showed all 180 cases were valid. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s report said illness claims, valid or not, varied strongly by location. The 10 districts with the highest absenteeism were low-income suburbs of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s three largest cities. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rinkeby </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> suburb inhabited mostly by immigrants, topped the list, with an absentee rate almost twice as high as the national average. `` People out here have heavy, monotonous, dangerous and boring jobs,'' said <PERSON> Gun </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansson </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Rinkeby </PERSON>'s social insurance office.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will use his upcoming trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to reaffirm the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to that country's security while seeking improved access for American products in South Korean markets, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say On the final leg of a trip that also will take him to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to spend 4 -LCB- hours in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital. There, he will meet with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and other officials and visit some of the more than 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in the country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departs Wednesday for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where he will attend Friday's funeral of Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> He will spend two nights in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are delighted with the political and economic development of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in recent years, there is growing impatience over South Korean barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, including beef and fruit. The result is a lopsided trade imbalance in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s favor _ about $ 10 billion last year on total two-way trade of slightly more than $ 30 billion. `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has free access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should now open up,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified further. Another irritant in the relationship between the two countries is the large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the capital area. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials have been engaged in discussions designed to ease the frictions. There is a small but determined radical movement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which is driven primarily by anti-Americanism. The radicals have attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> several times over the past month. A principal rallying cry recently has been opposition to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is a far different country today from the one which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw in 1982, his last visit there. The country's unpopular military dictatorship has been replaced by a democratically elected government, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> now ranks among the world leaders in economic growth rates. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made a major contribution to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s prosperity, accounting for 34 percent of the country's exports It is quite a change from the situation in the country during the decade after the armistice ended the Korean War in 1953, when the destitution there was such that some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials recommended suspending all economic assistance, considering the country's future prospects to be beyond hope. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been playing an increasingly active role internationally, establishing trade and diplomatic ties in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and hosting the Olympic Games last September. Last fall, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> began making peace overtures to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and asked then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to complement <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s steps with gestures of his own. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded by liberalizing rules for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic contact with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, encouraging cultural exchanges between the two countries and easing restrictions on tourist travel and the export of humanitarian items to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A subsequent exchange of notes included a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> proposal for formal diplomatic discussions, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regarded as unacceptable because it undercut <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s position. Still, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been encouraged by an apparent easing of tensions recently on the peninsula, an area long viewed as having the potential for an outbreak of <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> hostilities because of the major stake that both superpowers have there.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Front to Meet Moroccan King for Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Polisario guerrilla front says it will hold a second round of talks next week with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to discuss extending a truce and a political solution for the disputed <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. Polisario leader <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelaziz </PERSON>, speaking to a news conference Monday, also dismissed the newly declared five-nation union of north African Arab states as unviable as long as the conflict over <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> is unresolved. `` It is like building houses on a volcano which can erupt at any time,'' <PERSON> Abdelaziz </PERSON> said, speaking through a translator. The leaders of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> declared the union on Friday, but did not disclose details on how it will function. One likely result would be a suspension of aid and support by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for the Polisarios' 13-year war to free <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> from Moroccan rule. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> annexed most of the former <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> territory in 1976. <PERSON> Abdelaziz </PERSON> said he received word Sunday that <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> had agreed to meet a <LOCATION> Polisario </LOCATION> delegation next week, but the date and venue was not set. The king first met the Polisarios for two days in early January. The guerrillas later declared a cease-fire for February to improve the climate for the five-nation summit in <LOCATION> Marrakech </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdelaziz </PERSON> said. Asked if the truce could be extended, he said he hoped the meeting with <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> `` will be an occasion to transfer the truce into a political agreement.'' He said the Polisarios would not relinquish the demand for sovereignty over all of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, and rejected the idea of autonomy under a Moroccan flag. The options which should be put to the inhabitants in a referendum are `` total independence or integration into <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. For us, the only choice is total independence,'' he said. The Polisario delegation was in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as guest of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It was to meet Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, opposition leaders and Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> can buy hotels, he can buy football teams, he can buy casinos and airlines. But he ca n't buy respect. Spy magazine calls him a `` short-fingered vulgarian.'' Cartoonist <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> Breathed takes <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s brain and installs it in the skull of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> the Cat, the foul feline of `` Bloom County.'' A Daily News columnist writes that when she needs cheering up, she watches `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> do something silly.'' The Stand Up <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> comedy club devoted a night to ridiculing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. For two hours, comics drew laughter with readings from `` Trump: The Art of the Deal'' and took their own potshots _ suggesting, for example, that he bought a Parisian landmark and renamed it the `` Arc de Trump.'' The 43-year-old billionaire does not believe he deserves this tidal wave of derision, which rises along with his success and prominence. But <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> _ who declined to be interviewed _ thinks he understands it. `` Those who do n't like me do n't know me, and have never met me,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>. `` My guess is that they dislike me out of jealousy.'' Not so, say <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s detractors. They dislike him on merits. `` He's just an everyday slob with too much money. He just does n't have enough taste to keep his name off of things,'' said Breathed The sequence about <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s transplanted cerebrum, Breathed said, is born of his conviction that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> `` looks too smooth and polished on the outside. He should look like <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> the Cat.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is no stranger to the funny pages; he also appeared within the past year in `` Doonesbury.'' <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> tossing casino chips from the deck of his 282-foot yacht, the Trump Princess, to small boats below. This obviously was not the `` quality'' image <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> wants to project. `` I did pretty well in school, but for the life of me, I really ca n't understand what ` Doonesbury' is about,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has said. He suggested <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s wife, television's <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, `` has a lot more talent than he does.'' Critics have found fault with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s taste. When he announced last month that he intended to close that Plaza Hotel landmark of bogus Hawaiiana, Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s _ a closing that he delayed when the threat of the bar's demise improved business _ <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he was doing so not because of any hostility to Samoan Fog Cutters and similar drinks, but because the bar was tacky. `` Wildly tacky,'' riposted <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trebay </PERSON>, `` is Trump Tower, with its mean escalators and pink marble vastness. Does <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> think a waterfall wall is the acme of subtle design?'' Critics have found fault with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s ego and penchant for self-promotion. Daily News columnist <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, writing about a new board game based on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s wheeling and dealing, noted that `` Trump _ The Game'' contained `` approximately nine million photos of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>.'' The game is meant `` for players 12 and up, and I suppose there could be worse things to give your 12-year-old than a game that encourages him to act like <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. ` Uzi: The Crack Dealer,' for example,'' she mused. Critics have found fault with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s dedication to building glitzy buildings in a city where homelessness and poverty are endemic. One group staged a brunch for the homeless this month in front of the Plaza, along with a `` public shaming'' of its owner. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> did not attend. But the reigning champion of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bashers is Spy, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> satire magazine, and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has reacted with irritation and vitriol. In September, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> claimed Spy was in dire straits and would be out of business within a year; now each issue contains a countdown of `` our death foretold.'' Last week, an outraged <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> claimed that the father of a Spy executive had suggested Spy would ease up on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> if the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> offered the magazine to passengers; Spy said this was a joke. The irreverent and irascible magazine is fixated on the Big T _ on the `` eerily stiff hairdo'' of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ivana </PERSON>; on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> himself, who was mentioned derogatorily in all 10 issues last year and whose picture was compared in the March issue with the first police sketch of Son of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Each year, Spy lists the 100 most annoying people, places and things in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. One year, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was No. 1; one year, he was No. 3. Last year, he was Nos. 10, 14, 21, 26 and 30, subdivided into <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, Candidate; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, Acquirer; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, Boxing Promoter; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, Author, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, Fixer of Things We'd Almost Rather Leave Broken. `` We do n't hate him, we despise him,'' Spy said this month. But why? `` He's ... sort of a polyester guy in a 100 percent cotton world,'' froths Editor <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graydon </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` He represents a sort of mass-market, fake sophistication. In a city that invented real sophistication, his kind is driving the real stuff out.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is just warming up. He dismisses <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> as a `` sort of show-and-tell child'' who insists on splattering his name everywhere he goes. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> knows that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has become a celebrity _ his face on the covers of news magazines, his book a bestseller. To some, he is a capitalist hero. `` The folks who watch motivational cable shows late at night _ to them he's a hero,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` To anybody who cares about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who does n't like brass, he's no hero.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Kenyan diplomats are lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to block a threat by several congressmen to limit aid to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> because of alleged human rights abuses. The effort follows some acerbic criticism by the head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that appropriates money for foreign aid. `` It will be a cold day in you-know-where before this committee earmarks money for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., at a recent hearing on human rights in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` Earmarking'' is a method <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> uses to guarantee that select countries receive a certain amount of foreign aid, making them immune from administration attempts to shift assistance to other priorities. The bulk of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid is earmarked for about 20 countries, leaving the administration little room for maneuvering with the aid. Economic aid for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> has been earmarked for the past three years. Skillful efforts by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and its lobbyists last year brought the military component of the assistance under the protection of the earmark too, despite Obey's objections. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> got $ 15 million in military aid, which accounts for about 60 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and an additional $ 45 million in economic and development funds. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> supporters in the administration and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> cite the access granted by the strategically placed country to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships at <LOCATION> Mombasa </LOCATION> and to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planes at its airfields as reason enough for the financial support. But since last fall, when the aid was appropriated for fiscal year 1989, several other congressmen have joined Obey, head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, in criticizing what they view as <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s deteriorating human rights situation. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a member of Obey's committee who also serves as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement at the same hearing critical of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, which had been a `` shining star in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a model for its neighbors over many years,'' had been turning in a different direction in recent years, resulting in an erosion of its human rights record. Specific charges against <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> by human rights groups, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s annual international human rights report, include the stifling of political opposition by banning political parties and jailing dissidents. Critics also object to recent constitutional amendments that allow President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> to dismiss judges and to detain criminal suspects without trial for up to 14 days. But Kenyan Ambassador <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Afande </PERSON> said critics fail to understand that <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> is acting strictly within the bounds of its own constitution and laws. `` <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> is trying very hard to respect the rule of law,'' he said in an interview. `` The criticism here is very demoralizing to my people.'' Other African nations have much worse records than <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, he said, and many Kenyans feel their country is being picked on unfairly. `` We were very surprised by all this,'' <PERSON> Afande </PERSON> said.

 As many as 7,000 people were evacuated from their homes Monday after a leaking crude oil tank at a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> plant created a noxious cloud of gas with traces of hydrogen sulfide, officials said. More than 20 people were treated and released at hospitals for minor reactions to the fumes, most for fume inhalation, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were monitoring air quality in the area of the leak since it was discovered in the early afternoon, and described the gaseous release as a miminum health hazard that created a terrible odor. `` Most crude oils in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have sulphur in them, and that means their gas containes hydrogen sulfide, which is listed as one of the hazardous chemicals,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. Hydrogen sulfide is a flammable, poisonous gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs. `` We're doing continuous monitoring and we're finding that there's nothing there that is hazardous to health and we're also finding that the hydrocarbon smell in the air is lessening,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` But the odor got so strong that the city emergency response unit decided to go ahead and evacuate people downwind of it,'' he said. Authorities described the evacuation as the largest in recent years in this coastal city, a heavily industrial area near the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> border. `` We've had some real bad fires at these plants where people were injured and killed, but even then we never had an evacuation of this magnitude and I've been here 28 years,'' said <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>. Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> estimated late Monday that 5,000 to 7,000 people were evacuated from a densely populated 14 - by 17-block area on <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>'s west side About 3,000 people were being housed at three schools that were opened as emergency shelters, he said. Officials decided after a late meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> officials that the evacuation would continue until at least 7 a.m. Tuesday, <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> said. `` It appears the spill is under control, but the odor is still present and we're going to keep it evacuated until then,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> tests show a mimimal amount of hydrogen sulfide is present. At least 24 people were examined at local hospitals as a result of the leak, officials said. `` As far as I'm aware, plans are just to treat and release them,'' said Doctors Hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleyhl </PERSON>. `` Nobody suffered anything really bad.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> employee discovered the leak around 1:30 p.m. Monday, officials said. The leaking tank has a capacity of about 300,000 gallons, but its exact content was not known because it was connected to an automatic pump that fed into a refining unit, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. Crews were using vacuum trucks Monday evening to remove the spilled crude from a ditch surrounding the tank, but <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> estimated the task could take two or three days to complete.

 A cave-in in a gold mine shaft killed three miners in this northeastern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> city, the mine manager said.

 A major tobacco company advertised its cigarettes as `` Just what the doctor ordered'' at the same time it began a defense of smoking against growing evidence of serious health hazards, according to newly released documents. Reports and memorandums passed between the research firm <ORGANIZATION> A.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since the 1950s were gathered by a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney in a 1987 liability suit against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and released by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. More than 1,200 pages of the documents reviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> indicate that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> officials knew their product posed a health hazard but that they denied the dangers to themselves, smokers and the surgeon general. The documents, highlights of which were cited in the liability suit against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, by survivors of a heavy smoker, prove nothing, said <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M and <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarettes. `` The charge that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> suppressed information was rejected by the court and the jury,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>. `` In other words, we've been through all this and it ended up a big zero, and that was a 5 -LCB- - month trial. In that case, a federal jury in June found <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> partly responsible for a smoker's lung cancer and awarded $ 400,000 to her widower, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. But the jury cleared <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and two other cigarette makers, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of conspiring to mislead the public about the risks of smoking. `` Clearly they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- had enough evidence to conclude that the product was harmful to humans,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' anti-smoking office. `` They conducted counter-advertising programs to keep people smoking, and they modified their products to allay public fear without producing anything safer. We've paid an extremely heavy price in terms of human lives.'' The documents show that after a 1954 review of existing studies, A.D. Little and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> moved ahead with their own research, and began, often despite strong hints of hazards, a long defense of smoking. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising in the 1950s included the line `` <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> says L & amp; M filters are just what the doctor ordered.'' Other ads proclaimed `` Nose, throat and accessory organs not adversely affected by smoking Chesterfields'' and `` Play safe, Smoke Chesterfields.'' When <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON> reported in 1954 that smoking appeared to cause lung cancer, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> asked A.D. Little to put the damaging information into a more favorable light. The response was three short statements to be read after an episode of `` Dragnet.'' `` Before this year is ended about 20,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will get lung cancer. Twice as many will probably die in automobile accidents,'' one statement said. `` There is no real proof that the smoking of cigarettes is a cause of lung cancer now; there is only an association and a suspicion. Do n't let's be fooled by mere suspicion.'' A.D. Little scientists prepared a paper for presentation at a private conference in June 1960 in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> _ the site of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> headquarters _ that referred to statistics linking smoking with lung cancer and said data showing tobacco smoke caused skin cancer in laboratory animals `` are confirmed by experiments which were run in our own laboratories.'' Tobacco companies took the position that they could publicly deny any link between cancer and smoking as long as they could point to air pollution, drinking or any other possible factor in cancer rates in humans, said <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daynard </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks research and litigation on smoking. `` On a legal level, it's outrageous. There's a clear duty to warn,'' he said. The surgeon general released the first government report linking smoking to lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema in 1964. A February 1963 A.D. Little in-house draft on smoking and mortality rates prepared in anticipation of the surgeon general's report states that researchers felt there was `` a statistically significant, not merely apparent, relationship between cigarette smoking and death rates. But <PERSON> Liggett </PERSON> told the surgeon general in April 1963 that any assessment of the effects of cigarette smoking would be `` highly speculative.''

<TEXT>
 In this backward Armenian village torn apart last year by bitter ethnic strife and a devastating earthquake, the rival mountain people are finding it easier to mend bones than fences. Despite edicts from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that national differences be cast aside, and despite the daunting task of post-disaster recovery, the peasants of <LOCATION> Kursali </LOCATION> are loathe to let go of the hate for <LOCATION> Azerbaijanis </LOCATION> that has given them solace through severe tragedy. The long-simmering hostility between Armenians and Azerbaijanis that broke open a year ago forced the 1,100 residents of this ancient village to choose sides against friends and neighbors. There had been little trouble here, but, in an excess of adherence to the adage that blood is thicker than water, <PERSON> Kursali </PERSON> came to typify the headlong rush into ethnic trauma that wracked <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> before the earthquake. Nearly 1,000 Armenians sought refuge here after rioting and murder in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, some crowding into the hillside homes of relatives and others swapping the places they abandoned for stone hovels left behind by <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> made to pay for the crimes of their distant countrymen. <PERSON> Kursali </PERSON> was in the midst of such turmoil that officials have no clear idea how many people were here when the Dec. 7 earthquake struck, destroying every dwelling and visiting death on every family. `` For us every day is like the day of the earthquake. It's horrible,'' said <PERSON> Alavina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirzoyan </PERSON>, whose husband was killed when the house across the rutted road tumbled into ruins with him inside She lives with her three children and two elderly in-laws at a cold, windswept campsite among the rubble that used to be their home. Her sister-in-law, <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagiryan </PERSON>, contends the family can not be evacuated because of bureaucratic tangles and the fact that they delayed leaving until her brother's body was found two weeks after the earthquake. `` Now they've stopped evacuating people and look what these children must live with!'' she lamented, breaking into sobs. With no longstanding ties to the area, the family fears it will fall to the bottom of the housing allocation lists in the hands of officials of the close-knit villages surrounding <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, the city hit hardest by the earthquake. The <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> region's mayor, <PERSON> Vresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Adjyan </PERSON>, showing <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> representatives the village they have proposed to rebuild, conceded there has been a halt to evacuations but promised the family their plight would be addressed. `` We came here on Nov. 13 after we traded our home in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> for this,'' <PERSON> Grigory </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagiryan </PERSON> said, motioning to a pile of twisted beams and shattered stone walls. `` We do n't have jobs here or a home or anything. And the Azerbaijanis are laughing at us.'' Only two ruined homes away, <PERSON> Akhmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosanov </PERSON> tells a sad tale from the other side of the controversy. The Azerbaijani farmer lived all of his 65 years in the spacious stone home his grandfather built, raising seven children and tending a prosperous plot of fruit trees. But the Armenians who had been his friends through life drove him and other Azerbaijanis from the village when the flood of refugees arrived and ethnic hatred spread swiftly through the overwhelmed community. The home was taken over by Armenians, but <PERSON> Gosanov </PERSON> retains ownership of it and the rights to farm the land. `` We never had any problems here,'' the bewildered farmer said. `` We want to live here, but the Armenians wo n't let us.'' With his family safe in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Kirovabad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gosanov </PERSON> has been camped in freezing weather in a sod hut that he built in the corner of his property. He makes daily forays into nearby <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> to plead for a fair price for his property and losses. `` I've lived here all my life. My father died here, and my grandfather died here,'' <PERSON> Gosanov </PERSON> said. `` And now the Armenians are trying to throw me out.'' The Armenian officials of the <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> region have offered him only a fraction of what his rights to the private plot are worth, he contends. The ethnic conflict that has separated <PERSON> Gosanov </PERSON> from his Armenian neighbors stems from centuries-old differences and distrust between the Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis. Long suppressed by the official Soviet facade of multinational brotherhood, hostility broke open in the first days of 1988 when Armenians began demonstrating in demand of annexation of a mostly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The protests were initially peaceful, but counterdemonstrations by Azerbaijanis turned violent. On Feb. 28, zealots went on a rampage of atrocity, killing 26 Armenians and six others in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. Inter-ethnic turmoil rocked the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area intermittently throughout last year, and the earthquake that killed 25,000 people did nothing to defuse the widespread tensions. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> lashed out at the demonstrators after a visit to the earthquake-stricken area, but in distant regions such as <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and Kursali the local officials can do little to soften the strife. They often share the anti-Moslem sentiments of their fellow Armenians. <PERSON> Kursali </PERSON>, which is expected to be rebuilt this year, likely will continue to be plagued with discontent as the homeless masses with rival claims to residence here struggle to rebuild and return to the old ways. The Armenian refugees from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, who were welcomed with open arms last year, now are competing for the sturdy new homes to be built here. Claims of favoritism and injustice are expected to flourish when the houses are finished late this year. <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and nearby villages were evacuated after the earthquake, but the injured are recovering and returning to see what of their lives is salvageable. `` Nothing is getting better,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gukasyan </PERSON>, an Armenian refugee from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> recuperating at a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> field hospital in <LOCATION> Stepanavan </LOCATION>, another of the hardest-hit cities. `` The Azerbaijanis continue to throw us out, even when we have no place to go.''

<TEXT>
 Breathe deeply to greet the day? Not in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It has some of the dirtiest air in the world. It burns the eyes and nose, hides the spectacular, snowcapped volcanoes outside the city, and leaves tourists with a smell more memorable than the sights seen dimly through the haze. Doctors say the pall is a hazard for the metropolitan area's 19 million residents, and the public outcry has become loud enough to force at least some government action. `` For all of us who live here, it is shortening our lives,'' said <PERSON> Homero </PERSON> <PERSON> Aridjis </PERSON>, an writer of prose and poetry who speaks for the Group of 100 Artists and Intellectuals, an environmental protection group. Studies indicate athletes who exercise outdoors suffer reduced lung capacity. Patients with respiratory illnesses recover slowly. Embassies offer early retirement or weekends out of the smog. Schools closed in January, one of the worst months for pollution. `` Since the middle of 1986, the question has been who is going to take responsibility for the effect this has on children,'' said <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, who has been studying air pollution since the 1950s. `` We're not only contaminating more but it is increasing faster and in a way that is more damaging to health,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON>, director of pollution control. Pollution is not a top priority, however, for peasants who continue to arrive from the countryside in large numbers seeking work. `` Do you think they are going to be very worried about the environment when they're at a subsistence level wondering ` What am I going to eat?''' said <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, a graduate school and think tank. Ozone, the main contaminant, is caused largely by automobile exhaust and exceeded <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s acceptable level of .11 parts per million at least 323 days last year, according to government records. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, synonymous with smog in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the ozone standard of .12 parts per million was violated on 174 days in 1988. Mountains ring the Valley of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and what goes into its air has a hard time getting out. Winds carry pollution from the industrial north of the valley to the residential south. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>, the Spanish conqueror, first saw <LOCATION> Tenochtitlan </LOCATION>, the city's <LOCATION> Aztec </LOCATION> ancestor, 35 miles away between the 17,000-foot peaks of <LOCATION> Popocatepetl </LOCATION> and Iztaccihuatl. That was in November 1519; it seldom can be seen from that distance now. Officials and environmentalists blame the 3 million cars and other vehicles for 80 percent of the nearly 5 million tons of pollution expected this year. Few Mexicans can afford new cars. Officials estimate 60 percent of those in the valley need repairs and 1 million more than nine years old. The three chief polluters among the valley's 35,000 industries are owned by the government: an oil refinery in a densely populated neighborhood and two electric plants that burn heavy fuel oil. Adding to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s pollution problems is its altitude of 7,400 feet, which creates more pollution by preventing engines from burning fuel efficiently, and abundant sunshine that causes a chemical reaction creating ozone. Wind adds other elements _ dust from dry lake beds and fecal matter and garbage particles from open air dumps. The main problem doctors report is aggravation of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. `` The children we are studying are going to be people who have chronic illnesses,'' Ms. <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON> said. `` They may not die but they are n't going to have a healthy life,'' <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, a policemen on the busy <ORGANIZATION> Paseo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reforma </ORGANIZATION>, said some officers `` have had to go to the doctor and it turned out that even their lungs were affected. When they spit, it's black I have a friend they sent out of the city for 15 days on doctor's orders.'' Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON> of the government's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said a patient from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with respiratory or digestive illnesses is more difficult to treat than one from the provinces. `` He does n't respond to the treatments or responds badly,'' said <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, who heads an association studying pollution effects. Dr. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Shturman </PERSON> said a study he is conducting on athletes in a downtown park indicates at least one-third suffer respiratory impairment, compared with less than 10 percent of the general population. The air is so bad that making lungs more efficient is harmful, he said. `` The more they exercise, the more polluted the air is, the worse the potential for damage,'' he said. Shturman works out on a treadmill and small trampoline in his lab, with an air purifier going. Facing growing demand for action, the government last year began auto emission checks and extended school Christmas vacations through January. A new program calls for better studies of contamination sources, increased monitoring, use of low sulfur fuels in the refinery and other facilities and better control of industrial emissions. Catalytic converters and unleaded gasoline will be phased in by the early 1990s, officials say. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON>, the pollution control director, said the program is expected to cut pollution this year by 20 percent.

 A young woman's scathing public reply to a college student's classified ad seeking a wife has touched off a heated public debate over the low social status of intellectuals in a country that once prized learning. `` Wielders of pens like you are less than beggars; people like you who take the world prize for being behind the times are nothing but fools,'' she wrote in a letter published in the <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' News, where the lovelorn student placed his ad. The tale was retold Monday in the national newspaper for intellectuals, the Guangming Daily. Neither the woman nor the student was identified. `` Learning is not food on the table, ideals are not money to spend,'' the woman wrote. `` Modern women eat money and people like you who wield pens and do n't have money can only marry 50-year-old housewives. If you do marry a housewife, advise your children not to go to school. Five years of elementary school is enough, everyone nowadays uses calculators. `` Tell them to sell soft-shelled turtles'' _ an expensive delicacy _ `` and they can become multimillionaires.'' The letter, published in coastal <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province late last year, `` touched a sensitive spot in society,'' the Guangming Daily said. The Zhejiang Workers' News was inundated with phone calls and nearly 700 letters from readers who agreed with the woman or offered consolation to the young man. `` This view that learning has no value is just a temporary phenomenon,'' wrote one reader, <PERSON> Shao </PERSON> <PERSON> Guoqin </PERSON>. But many teachers, researchers and writers fear their low status has become a permanent feature of modern Chinese society. After centuries in which scholars ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and learning was the only way to advance, those with college degrees have become one of the poorest-paid groups in cities. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> last year found that college graduates earned an average of $ 9 less each month than illiterates. Most college professors earn far less than the $ 54 per month that is common for factory workers. Scholars' traditional status first was undermined by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s distrust of them and the revolutionary leader's emphasis on the wisdom of simple peasants. Since <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s death in 1976, intellectuals no longer face attack as class enemies. Instead, in a society newly concerned with making money, they have watched inflation erode the spending power of their fixed salaries while factory workers have been encouraged with pay bonuses. `` Our brains are stuffed with learning, but are our pockets jingling?'' one college graduate wrote to the <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> Workers' News `` We can only haggle with the peddlers _ a penny for cabbage, two cents for radishes. Women treat college students with disdain and some people in society look down on them _ is n't it because there's no money in studying?'' Surveys found that intellectuals have less leisure time than other urban residents and live an average of 58 years, 10 years less than the national average, due apparently to poor nutrition and hard work. College students, worried about their futures, repeatedly have put up posters protesting the poor status of intellectuals. The problem has been a theme of all student protests in recent years, including rallies and a poster campaign last June at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> University that began when a student was killed by a group of unemployed youths. Students also have protested by dropping out. Official reports said the number of undergraduates quitting school rose 45 percent last year, while the number going on to postgraduate studies fell 75 percent.

<TEXT>
 When the curtain rises on the Metropolitan Opera's two-story new production of `` Salome,'' it looks like a set for a <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> opera or maybe `` Cabaret.'' It cries out `` German decadence'' in the time the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> came to power. It does n't make `` Salome'' any more universal to set it in the century in which <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> composed it rather than in biblical times, but it works. Even for an audience which has heard `` Salome'' often before, the production and <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> as Salome provided some chilling moments. Miss <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> is exceptional. Her voice soars through dense orchestration. Mature technique gets her there but she keeps her voice sounding young. Salome is young and director <PERSON> Nikolaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehnhoff </PERSON> has directed carefully in that direction. Her acting conveys that Salome does n't understand the lust that draws her to <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Baptist When he flings her from him, she has childish tantrums. After <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Baptist is beheaded, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Marton </PERSON>'s voice becomes mature-sounding and she seems to be bragging about a kinky lust she now does understand. Two or three small excesses could be trimmed so the theatrical experience is n't broken by inappropriate laughter. The stage is slanted but a woman pushed away by a man probably would n't roll over twice from the shove. When Miss <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> starts her dance, she removes the long pink gloves that match her girlish gown and twirls the gloves like a stripper before throwing them to <PERSON> Herod </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassilly </PERSON> sounded Wagnerian as <PERSON> Herod </PERSON>, keeping a full voice centered to punch it authoritatively through the large orchestra. <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Dernesch </PERSON> was glamorous as <PERSON> Salome </PERSON>'s mother, Herodias. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sounded very good as <ORGANIZATION> Narraboth </ORGANIZATION>, the young guard captivated by <PERSON> Salome </PERSON>. He replaced <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenshein </PERSON>, who was ill. The set is like nothing else the Met has seen. The main stage looks like the basement of a castle, with walls of black bricks, a gate at the back and a rectangular hole in the floor, the dungeon where <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Baptist, called <PERSON> Jochanaan </PERSON> in the opera, is kept. <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Weikl </PERSON> sounded commanding as <PERSON> Jochanaan </PERSON>. But his standing against the gate, arms outstretched like <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> on the cross, was another effect used too often. Miss <PERSON> Marton </PERSON>'s dance of the seven veils was a success. She began with graceful arm motions and no veils in sight. As she danced, she removed the skirt of her dress and sheer underskirts, throwing them into the dungeon. She finished in a simple white dress. <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowski </PERSON> conducted superbly. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON> had spotlights follow principals through the general gloom and put two fixed spotlights on <PERSON> Jochanaan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehnhoff </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Hannover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was making his Met directing debut. Set and costume designer <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a native of Bernburg-Saale, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, also made his Met debut.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made an appeal Monday for the `` earliest possible'' parole of soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had been a model prisoner and an inspiration to others. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for more than 90 minutes to discuss the singer's health, his trouble with the law and his stay at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a self-styled civil rights activist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and longtime protege of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, met <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the airport. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> asked to join the meeting with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> corrections officials refused. Neither <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s list of approved visitors, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had received prior permission, authorities said. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> minister and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native said he wanted to meet with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and learn more about the case. He said he had spoken with Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, to see what could be done for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his intention was not to criticize any of the legal aspects surrounding the case, including the six-year sentence <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> received. `` The appeal really is for mercy,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said he also wanted to clear up misconceptions about <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s convictions <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is concerned that the public mistakenly thinks he was charged with the use or possession of drugs and that he shot at police. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in a statement read by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said, `` I am not on drugs.'' The 55-year-old entertainer, who lives in <LOCATION> Beech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, is serving a six-year sentence at the minimum-security prison after being convicted in January of an array of charges stemming from a two-state, high-speed chase on Sept. 24. Judge <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said then that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> must undergo examination and treatment for any drug or alcohol problem he might have as part of his sentence on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> conviction. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Authorities said the chase began after <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> disrupted an insurance seminar in an <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, office building by walking in with a shotgun. Before officers could arrive, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> left the building and a chase began. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to having no state license tag, reckless driving, driving with a suspended license, attempting to flee or elude police, carrying a deadly weapon to a public gathering, simple assault and improper lane change. He was fined $ 1,000 and given a six-year sentence that runs concurrently with the six-year sentenced he received in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for failing to stop for authorities during the chase. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in August 1991.

<HEAD>Native Indians Meet to Protest Hydroelectric Dams</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In their first joint political action, more than 500 Indians from 20 <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> rain forest tribes have gathered in this jungle town to protest planned hydrolectric dams that would flood their lands. Sporting green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and red and black warpaint, about 100 warriors from the <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> tribe ran chanting into a brick community center Monday in <LOCATION> Altamira </LOCATION>, which is 2,000 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janiero </LOCATION>. The tribe circled in a ritual dance, then sat to applaud as the men, women and children of each subsequent tribe arrived for a week of debates, speeches and other events. For the first time, <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tribes were together to discuss common concerns. The Indians are protesting the proposed <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Babaquara </PERSON> dams on the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> river. If built, the reservoirs would flood about 3,000 square miles of jungle, displacing 7,000 of the 220,000 Indians who remain in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. About 5 million Indians roamed the country when the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> arrived in the 1500s and `` settled'' what is now <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest nation Anthropologists have expressed fears about the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' continued survival, as hundreds of thousands of non-Indian homesteaders, ranchers and prospectors stream into the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> annually, chopping and burning away the rain forest and ignoring demarcations of native tribal areas. `` We want the government to rethink the dams,'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Terena </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Terena </PERSON> tribe told a cheering crowd packed into the community center. `` The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of our culture and our ancestors.'' `` We will not accept the dams,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanomami </PERSON> of the primitive <LOCATION> Yanomami </LOCATION> tribe. `` The river will rise. The fish will die. The game will move away.'' Later in the day, thousands of farmers and local shopowners marched through <LOCATION> Altamira </LOCATION>, a town of 38,000, carrying placards saying `` Dams mean more jobs and more progress'' and `` Gringos leave us in peace.'' `` I know the Indians will have problems, but I'm in favor of the dams,'' said <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastos </PERSON>, owner of an Altamira bar. `` I believe the dams will bring development and progress for us.'' Government and industry leaders say the energy provided by the dams is vital for the growth of this Third World nation. The government representative to the meeting, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON>, president of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, spoke to whistles and boos from the crowd, which included native Indian leaders from around the world, hundreds of foreign and Brazilian environmentalists, and droves of journalists. `` We recognize that great indignities were committed against the Indian people. But now it is a question of national awareness. We are here to listen,'' <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. The late December shooting death of internationally-known <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> ecologist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, who fought against the destruction of the rain forest by ranchers, increased international awareness of the movement to preserve the jungle and protect its native peoples. Environmentalists are concerned that slash burning of the rain forest is contributing to the warming of world temperatures and destroying both a vital source of oxygen and an important habitat for animal and plant life. The ecologists are trying to discourage foreign lending institutions from putting money into Brazilian development projects considered harmful to the enviroment and native peoples. Foreign governments and environmental groups have, for example, proposed that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> swap part of its $ 115 billion foreign debt for promises to preserve parcels of jungle territory. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, for his part, has said he does n't want any meddling in domestic affairs by foreigners.

<HEAD>Pinochet Plans To Play Kingmaker In Presidental Race And Remain Army
Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> says that although the constitution prevents him from running for re-election, he will still pick the candidate he wants to succeed him and will not step down as army chief. `` I'm going to tell you soon whom we must support'' in presidential balloting scheduled for Dec. 14, the right-wing general told cheering supporters on Sunday in <LOCATION> Temuco </LOCATION>, 370 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` Let's stay together, let's not quarrel among ourselves,'' the 72-year-old army commander said in his speech carried by <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspapers on Monday. `` We should not yield the field to those other gentlemen'' in the opposition. Congressional elections also will be held Dec. 14. The Temuco speech quickly drew fire from opposition leaders, who called <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s remarks a threat to any future elected government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was ending an eight-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> during which he made clear that he plans to retain a key role in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> once he steps down from the presidency in March 1990. The 55,000-men army is by far the most powerful of the armed services and the key to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s hold of power for more than 15 years. Under a 1980 military-written constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is allowed to remain army commander for eight years after leaving the presidency. He must hand power over on March 11, 1990, to the winner of the December election. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, vice president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s remarks: `` That's unacceptable <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> should leave the army as a gesture of dignity.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> took power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist who died in the takeover. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was obliged to call the elections after losing an Oct. 5 referendum, in which he sought voters' approval to remain in power until 1997. After the referendum defeat, the pro-Pinochet forces split. At least two politicians formally announced their candidacies for president and conservative business leaders are actively promoting the nomination of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 39-year-old finance minister, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. Several small groups also asked that a formula be found, probably a constitutional amendment, to allow <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to run. He insists, however, he definitely will not be a candidate. The constitution bars him from running. But <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has made it clear that he plans to play an active role in the campaign and the election by telling his followers for whom to vote. The opposition says it plans to seek a single presidential candidate. Leaders of a coalition of 17 opposition parties are scheduled to pick the nominee next month among at least four contenders. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, is considered the front-runner. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party, and was the opposition's chief spokesman during the campaign for the referendum.

<HEAD>Communist Party Newspaper Goes For People Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The People's Daily, the voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, is trying out a new look in an attempt to win back readers by giving them more of the news that interests them. The paper has seen its circulation fall 20 percent a year recently. Currently, 4 million papers are printed a day, the most of any daily in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but only 2 percent of subscribers are private citizens. In a front-page letter Monday to its readers, the paper said the change would increase the amount and the timeliness of news. It also said it would `` work to reflect the opinion of the people and help employ public opinion to bring our paper closer to the masses, closer to life.'' `` Not bad for day one,'' said a retired official as he read the paper in downtown <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` I guess you could say it's ` glasnost' with Chinese characteristics. In the past, the paper has been filled with reports about bureaucrats opening a meeting here and closing one there. Tidbits of important information were often buried. Breaking news such as plane crashes and important government decisions was either not reported or published late and with scant details. The paper paid infinite attention to theoretical issues of little import to everyday life. Many Chinese used to read the paper to gauge the latest shift in the political wind. But as the society has become more concerned with economic development than ideology, the paper's usefulness _ and its readership _ has diminished. Monday's editions differed from previous weeks, but only slightly. International news was displayed on page one. Several breaking stories were reported with current details. An unusual report appeared on the status of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s military draft. More photographs lined the pages. `` They would n't have had this a while ago,'' said <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kexing </PERSON>, pointing to a story about hundreds of fishermen illegaly trawling for eels on the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Before, they'd only report it after it ended.'' A companion story asked the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for reaction. `` Telephone Interview By The Paper,'' read the headline. `` They seem to be showing off here,'' said <PERSON> Kang </PERSON>. `` Very pleased with themselves for reporting this so soon.'' Other readers pointed to a story on <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s apology to Moslems angered by his book, `` The Satanic Verses.'' `` In the past, it seemed that the only international news we got were things almost directly related to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said one reader. `` This has nothing to do with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. That seems to be a change, and a good one.'' The changes are limited, however. The People's Daily, like all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s papers and publications, remains run by a government very concerned with what is read by its people. Newspaper officials interviewed Monday said they believed the change would help the circulation which has dropped further since January when the paper doubled in price to about 5 -LCB- cents. Readers on the street were less enthusiastic. `` There's no comparison between this and some of the other papers,'' said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Gong </PERSON>, a 23-year-old university student. Indeed, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> is by far the stodgiest of the four dailies with the highest circulation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The No. 2 paper, the Worker's Daily, although generally conservative, occasionaly comes out in favor of greater power for the state-run labor union. Next in line, the Legal Daily, often is filled with lurid stories of murders and rapes. The No. 4 paper, <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the most interesting publications in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Over the last seven months, it has written on labor strife, prostitution, homosexuality and the uses of liquor for bribery. `` The People's Daily was boring before and it's boring now,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daqin </PERSON>, a worker in his 20s as he peered against a glass case holding Monday's editions on bustling Wangfujing Street. `` They've changed the soup but the prescription's the same.''

<HEAD>Industry-Led Consortia Needed to Combat Foreign Competition, Group
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More industries must conduct joint research, with government support, to cope with foreign competitors in critical electronics areas, a panel of industry, academic and government experts recommends. `` The survival of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial base in vital electronics sectors is at stake,'' said a statement issued after a workshop meeting last week held under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. It said participants at the workshop had reached a consensus that `` to address the problem, we endorse industry-led consortia with government cooperation and support.'' The IEEE is a New York-based professional association with more than 250,000 members worldwide. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> IEEE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and Information Policy, said the consortia envisioned by the panel would go beyond efforts currently being mounted by <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies developing advanced technology for computer chip-making. `` Consortia similar to <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> are needed because <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> alone will not do the whole job,'' he said. `` Sematech is a good start, but that only addresses one part of the industry.'' During last week's meeting, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said, `` it was explored as to how far along the spectrum of research, development, manufacturing and commercialization these consortia should go. The consensus was that they certainly should stop short of commercialization.'' The workshop involving about 60 participants from industry, academia and government was held Feb. 14 at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. A majority of the workshop's participants agreed that the situation involving foreign competition was serious, but they decided to shy away from estimating specifically how much it will cost to turn things around. `` There was widespread if not unanimous agreement that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic industries are in deep trouble, that there is a fighting chance to recover, that this will have its costs and that these costs will be non-trivial. But there was a reluctance at this early stage to mention a dollar figure for government support or private investment,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAdams </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manageent </ORGANIZATION>, said the panel put most emphasis on developing initiatives in three areas _ high-definition television, advanced-design memory chips and high-resolution computer systems `` We think that these initiatives will have enormous benefits to the domestic economy,'' <PERSON> McAdams </PERSON> said. `` One trouble with talking about cost is that people forget about benefits. We believe that whatever we recommend will have payoffs many-fold greater than cost.'' The workshop stressed the importance of developing dual-use technologies that meet both civilian and military needs. <PERSON> McAdams </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has committed about $ 30 million and put out a call for proposals in the area of high-resolution computer systems. `` We applaud the fact that they've acted quickly and that they recognize that these are multi-use technologies, with both military and civilian implications,'' he said. Participants at the workshop also looked for government support of the electronics initiatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> Last week's meeting followed a position statement adopted Jan. 25 by the <ORGANIZATION> IEEE </ORGANIZATION>'s Technology Activities Council. The statement said that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must immediately re-establish significant technological capability and domestic manufacturing of world-class products by U.S.-owned firms based on electronic and related technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes.'' `` The situation is critical,'' it said. `` A pro-active stance by the federal government is required if these goals are to be achieved.''

The dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 1.40 yen from Monday's 125.75-yen finish The currency opened at 126.60 yen and was traded in a range of 126.60-127 .35 yen Dealers said many market participants hesitated to make major moves before Congressional testimony by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> scheduled for later Tuesday. They added that the dollar moved higher because speculative investors bought up the currency in anticipation of a tighter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policy. On the stock exchange, profit-taking erased earlier gains made by the index, which had won about 48.40 points shortly after the market opened for trading. Dealers said many speculative investors backed off in fear that the main market barometer may rise too sharply. Attention focused on medium-sized shares, they said.

Many of the dignitaries <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will see have talked with him during his eight years as vice president, but there is a big difference now. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is no longer the understudy. First on the visitors' list will be French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, arriving in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after a flight of more than 15 hours, will go directly to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy for a luncheon meeting with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. As he dines with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s body clock will tell him it is about midnight Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> it will be about 2 p.m. Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to nap on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on the way to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to help adjust to the 14-hour time difference. Blocks of time have been set aside for other meetings on Thursday night, Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. The entire list of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visitors has not been released but his guests are expected to include several <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> leaders: <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and Israeli President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> Others who will see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Mobuto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seku </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also will meet with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Akasaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> and with Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> at the Imperial Palace. In compiling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s guest list, White House officials considered the nature of relations with countries whose leaders expressed an interest in seeing the president, officials said. They also looked at whether there were shared interests, as well as whether there was a past personal relationship. White House officials consulted with Japanese officials to make sure they would not take offense at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for using the occasion of the funeral for private meetings. `` We checked with the Japanese and they said it was perfectly correct to do so,'' said a White House official. In fact, the official said, the Japanese are pleased that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> will be the site of such high-level meetings. The president will receive dignitaries one by one at the American Embassy across the street from the Okura Hotel where he's staying. Most of the meetings will run between 20 to 30 minutes, longer if translations are necessary. Immediately after his last bilateral meeting Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will depart for a two-night stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the second country on a three-nation journey. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, he plans to meet with Chinese human rights activist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>. The Times quoted sources as saying <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> has been invited to a reception that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is an internationally recognized astrophysicist and has often been compared to Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. The meeting would mark the first time that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president has met with a Chinese dissident in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The president also will stop briefly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday night. White House officials are playing down expectations of major developments from the talks. `` They are largely a renewal of acquaintances or introductions _ discussions of broad topics of mutual interests,'' one official said. `` You ca n't expect too much substantial accomplishment or resolution of thorny issues in a 20 to 30 minute meeting,'' the official added.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane with eight people on board crashed and exploded in a swampy forest just north of this base in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, officials said. The C-141 Starlifter cargo plane left from <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, refueled in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and was on its final approach to land here when air traffic controllers from adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> suddenly lost radio and radar contact around 8 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> reported an explosion about four miles north of the field, said Airman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON>, duty officer at the airfield. It remained unknown early Tuesday whether there were any survivors, said <LOCATION> Hurlburt </LOCATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinneard </PERSON>. Seven people on board were crew members and one was a civilian passenger, <PERSON> Kinneard </PERSON> said. Military and civilian fire and rescue units reached the crash site by 10:10 p.m., <PERSON> Kinneard </PERSON> said. `` It's an extremely rugged area,'' Capt. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hurlburt </LOCATION> spokesman said early Tuesday. `` They're still working to get to the actual wreck itself.'' He said a helicopter had been dispatched to the site. The area around the base was hit by strong thunderstorms and flashes of lighting through much of the night. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was too early to tell if the bad weather played a part in the crash. The plane crashed in a forested swamp in the middle of the testing range at <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters for non-nuclear arms testing, the spokesman said. `` They've found one of the engines in a creek,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurkovic </PERSON>, a dispatcher at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which sent three rescue units to the scene. The C-141, capable of carrying up to 200 troops, belonged to the 63rd <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION>, which is about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said base spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. The names of those aboard will be withheld pending notification of next of kin, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said.

 In the 1960s, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> watched a news report about the home of the nation's 36th president and decided that <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s ranch needed a few ducks. So he wrote a letter and proposed a trade: mallards to put in the water on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s property in exchange for a Lone Star <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> hat. `` It seems that you have a deal,'' <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s aide, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Deathe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, replied. The presidential pact was a feather in <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>'s cap, but no big deal for his <ORGANIZATION> Whistling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, beak broker to the world. The <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> family is to mallards what the Wrigleys are to gum. Only more so. Each year, 200,000 mallards are born in this town of 1,100, which lies 10 miles east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the northwestern corner of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. They're sold to conservation groups, university researchers, hunting clubs, foreign palaces and even a few restaurants _ around the globe. `` We originally started as a hunting club, but it never really got off the ground,'' said the founder's son, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, who shares duck-keeping duties with his sister, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` Dad brought the idea home from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II. But at that time we were too far from any major city to draw hunters, so we diversified and simply went into raising the birds,'' he said. Because mallards are the most popular hunting ducks, Whistling Wings stuck with them. `` We've grown up with it,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, `` and it's grown with us. `` When you pick up the phone you never know who you're going to be talking to. Once it was a caller from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, inquiring about ducks for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Chilean officials asked if they could send a plane to get some eggs, and the <ORGANIZATION> Brookfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bought a duck each week for an 11-foot anaconda snake. `` It just would n't take anything else,'' said zoo reptile curator <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>. Whistling Wings has 4,000 breeding ducks. Each hen produces at least 40 eggs that hatch in incubators after 27 days. <ORGANIZATION> Ducks </ORGANIZATION> sell for $ 1.55 to $ 15.50 depending on the age of the duck and size of the order. Younger ducks cost less. Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and her brother deal ducks out of a small office in the center of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>. A few miles south, near the town sign that welcomes travelers to the `` World's Mallard Duck Capital,'' is the farm where ducks are kept in pens during late fall and winter. When the weather turns warm, most newborn mallards are driven to a chain of small, private lakes on 300 hilly acres in <LOCATION> Jo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daviess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We want to raise them in their own environment,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> explained as he took a visitor around the scenic duck territory, icy and bare in winter. By truck or plane, they're shipped to 48 states and points beyond _ sometimes unintentionally. `` Mom took some into <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> once for a flight to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` The plane was hijacked to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. One-thousand birds headed to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> became Cuban ducks.''

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to abandon its plan to dig a ditch near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> along a four-mile stretch of border that drug smugglers and illegal immigrants now cross in vehicles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the 8-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch was originally planned to improve drainage along the border on the relatively flat <LOCATION> Otay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. But more recently, they said it could also discourage narcotics traffickers and illegal aliens from crossing the border in cars and trucks. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said construction could begin within two months and should be completed by summer. In a statement late Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to abandon plans to dig the ditch `` and immediately begin a study of other alternatives that would permit a quick and acceptable solution to the problem of flood waters on the Otay <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>.'' Ministry officials reacted with surprise in late January to news reports that one purpose of the planned ditch would be to deter drug smugglers and illegal immigrants. They said they had only been told the ditch, about 25 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, was meant to improve drainage. The project has since been criticized by people on both sides of the border. Some have likened it to the Berlin Wall, and several Mexican congressmen called it an `` unfriendly'' gesture. Immigration officials say the isolated <LOCATION> Otay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> is the most popular crossing point for illegal immigrants along the 1,950-mile U.S.-Mexico border. About one-third of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants seized in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year were rounded up on the mesa. Officials say up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> each month. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement came three days after <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told a meeting of Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governors from border states that the ditch would prevent illegal drugs and aliens from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he emphasized that its primary purpose would be drainage. `` I hope it will be understood for what it is and what it is not. At no time was there an intent to send a negative message -LRB- to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said during the 7th International Border Governors Conference in the northern city of <LOCATION> Saltillo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading stock index today plunged from its latest record high, and the dollar gained sharply against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 197.00 points, or 0.61 percent, closing at 31,980.08. That was its first closing below the 32,000-yen level since Feb. 14, when it ended at 31,982.89. It had set a record high closing of 32,177.08 on Monday. The plunge in the index resulted mainly from the dollar's quick rise on the foreign exchange market, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. He also said prospects for a tighter economic policy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, possibly leading to higher interest rates, discouraged investors from buying stock while awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> testimony by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> scheduled later today. Expectations of higher interest rates generally discourage stock buying, the analyst added. In addition, he said, institutional investors feared the Nikkei had risen too high recently and were selling to take profits. In active trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.2 billion shares, steel and real estate shares were among losers. In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 1.40 yen from Monday's 125.75-yen finish. The dollar opened at 126.60 yen, its low for the day, and went as high as 127.35 yen. The dollar's sharp rise was prompted by expectations of <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> suggesting a tighter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policy later today, dealers said. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to foreigners. Some traders avoided major moves before <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony, dealers added.

 A moose is keeping a vigil near four mares on a farm here, but the horses' owner says the animal is lonely, not lovestruck.

 An effort to have the magpie declared the state bird was beaten back by ruffled lawmakers, but only after a legislator proposed a unique designation: state scavenger. State Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Yellowtail </PERSON> extolled the magpie's virtues in pushing a bill to have it replace the meadowlark as the state bird. He said the magpie is self-sufficient and hardy, like Montanans, and praised it for staying in the state during bad weather as well as good, unlike the migrating meadowlark. `` The meadowlark right now reclines on a <LOCATION> Bahama </LOCATION> beach, bedecked in sunglasses and <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> shorts and drinking a mint julep,'' Yellowtail said. But other lawmkers denounced the magpie's eating habits and its noisy chattering. Sen. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said legislators who live in the capital for part of the year should n't criticize those who head south for the winter. `` Where would you be living today if people in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> did n't go south for the winter?'' she asked. `` We'd all be in tents on the Capitol lawn.'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> suggested the meadowlark retain its post and the magpie be designated as the state scavenger, a move the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved 34-14. `` I'd like to honor both of these birds in the way that they ought to be honored,'' she said.

Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> ran two stories on how a thief and rapist became a soldier after his father gave the wife of a military official a job. The articles said such occurrences are common. Monday's <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> cited one regiment in which 433 men claimed to have a high school level education. When they were given a test only 4 percent passed and 37 percent got a grade of zero. Of the 150 new conscripts another company got last year, the majority were `` gamblers, fighters, thieves and hooligans,'' the report said. One man was wanted for murder, another for escaping from jail. One headed a criminal organization. In one division, 200 of the 733 soldiers were shorter than the 5-foot-3 cut-off point. `` Deaf mutes, sick people also become soldiers,'' the report said. `` Schizophrenics, epileptics are also not rare.'' `` Everybody in my county fills in the draft form the same way,'' said one illiterate soldier when asked why he claimed to have a high school education on his draft card. `` We fill it in as we wish. And whatever we say, that'll do for the truth. I ca n't write so I had my cousin fill it in.'' A Western military analyst said the annual draft was moved up this year to force soldiers to undergo an extra winter training period in their three years of service. The extra exercises will help in the selection of officers and strengthen the military's weak winter fighting capacity, he said. Conscription is supposed to play a key role in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s program to modernize its military and abandon <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s philosophy for guerrilla warfare, `` People's War. Under that strategy, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> threw the largest number of people in the smallest amount of space and tried to overwhelm its enemy. But heavy losses suffered in 1979 during a border war with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> signaled its death knell. Reforms in the last nine years have cut at least 1 million men from the military, leaving fewer than 3 million in uniform. Standards for new soldiers have been raised. Today, 70 percent of divisional leaders have college educations, compared with 1.6 percent in 1982. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> started buying advanced weapons from the West and developing its own arms industry. Last year, it reinstituted a ranking system after a 23-year ban and elite fighting squads began practice. Serious problems have developed in the draft, however. Attracted by the opportunites available under current economic reforms, many men do n't want to be soldiers. Others, who lack the educational, cultural or physical standards still look to the military as a way out of the countryside. `` The military is in a bind,'' said the military attache, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The only people who want to be soldiers are hillbillies but the system has changed. No more is it just ` a rifle and a sleeping bag and off you go, sunshine.''' Corruption is rife as thousands of qualified men bribe officials to let them out of military service and others who do n't qualify pay to get in. In addition, the defense budget has been cut drastically, from about 17.5 percent of all state expenditures in 1978 to 8 percent today. Many officers want early retirement to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> says he's more worried than at any other time during the 26 years he's fought for birth control and abortion rights. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> fears that his work, which led in part to the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, may swiftly come undone. And he's concerned that no one understands what's at stake in the growing battle between anti- and pro-abortion activists. `` I see war,'' predicted <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>. `` I see that this nation has a real potential to turn into <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> unless people take seriously this holy war being waged.'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, 56, believes women are about to lose important civil rights allowing them to have abortions and to choose birth-control devices. He views the onslaught against abortion as the result of an aggressive right-wing agenda initially promoted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration. `` The real root of the anti-abortion movement is to keep women at home waiting with the pipe and slippers,'' he said. `` It's called control.'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> says he began his crusade in the early 1960s when a woman died in his arms after a self-inflicted abortion attempt with an eight-inch coat hanger. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> believes that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women may be forced to return to that era. `` I grieve over the fact that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> seems fast asleep at the wheel,'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said during a recent interview at his counseling and referral clinic in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Americans should wake up and learn that freedom is n't free.'' Despite his years battling anti-abortion activists, <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> has never taken a public stance on the morality of choosing an abortion. `` And I never will,'' he said. `` We men have been telling women what to do for too long. When I'm asked the question in debates, I always say, ` I'll never get pregnant, it is n't up to men to decide for women.''' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> often travels with a voluminous file of old press clippings that detail his brushes with the law _ like his 1967 arrest for distributing contraceptives to <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students. For a man closely associated with the once-revolutionary concept of sexual freedom, <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> leads a near-monastic life. He has lived 400 miles apart from his wife and four children for almost 15 years. The decision to live separately came after his children became the target of death threats. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> moved them to an undisclosed town somewhere in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and lives alone `` behind a six-foot high fence'' on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>'s two other counseling clinics are in <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hauppage </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. His clinics do not offer abortions because they became too expensive to perform, he said. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said he is `` painfully lonely'' and admitted that his children harbor some resentment over his work and the family's separation But nothing can stay him from his crusade. He said he recently worked night and day on behalf of a comatose <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman who was allowed by a judge to have an abortion earlier this month over the objection of anti-abortion activists. `` I see myself as the candle that lights the darkness of ignorance and sexism,'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have much money but I'm the most stubborn man you'll ever meet in your life.'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> is most bitter about a 1971 incident in which he gave a lecture on birth control before an audience that included a mother and her 14-month old child and was arrested for corrupting a minor. He also served three months in prison for distributing contraceptives. He said he still `` remembers how I felt standing in the ashes'' after his <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION> clinic was firebombed in 1979. He has been shot at, spat at and reviled even by some feminists. But he will not be deterred. `` I will die fighting this cause,'' he said. `` I eat, sleep and breathe your rights.''

 A minor earthquake shook <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburbs, but there were no reports of damage, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. The quake occurred at 10:48 p.m. PST Monday about 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and registered 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the center said. The quake was felt in the south <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburbs of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Enumclaw </LOCATION> and Skyway, the center said. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage.

The southeast corner has been made to appear as it did when <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ate lunch there Nov. 22, 1963, waiting for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s motorcade Visitors may not share <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s perch _ which has been sealed off with glass _ but see a view of Elm Street close to it. `` I got a big lump in my throat when I saw this window,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Veno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I've waited a long time to see this. A long, long time.'' The 9,000-square-foot exhibit organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> contains 350 photographs, 30 artifacts, a 30-minute audio tour and six films running a total of 40 minutes. `` Our purpose is not to preserve the memory of that death,'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a dedication ceremony. `` It is not in our power to preserve what already lives so powerfully any more than we could erase or escape this history. `` The lessons of history found here will be passed, like a torch, to all generations.'' `` About 26 years ago <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was wounded,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` But today we stand here whole again.'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> residents often have debated whether there should be official recognition of the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> assassination in the city where he was killed. The Sixth Floor, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said, shows <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> has `` finally reconciled the pain of the past with the promise of hope for the future.'' Although it was packed with people, the museum was very quiet, save for some small talk and a couple of children asking quesions. Four-year-old <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> looked up at his father, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, a computer programmer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Why would anyone want to kill a president?'' the boy asked.

The move by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was in direct reponse to the Common Market foreign ministers' decision in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, on Monday to recall their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not specify the countries from which the Iranian ambassadors were withdrawn and it was not immediately known in what Common Market countries <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has maintained ambassadors. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, for example, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has been represented by a charge d'affaires. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that respect for <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> and its values will remain an inviolable principle in relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other countries, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The communique said that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s week-old order for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death for blaspheming Islam with his book `` The Satanic Verses'' was a `` consensus judgement of all Moslem leaders throught the world,'' the agency reported The dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> deplored the refusal of the European community to condemn the book and criticized the community's support for a work it said blasphemes Islam. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced Monday it would withdraw all its diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and request that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recall its representatives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had refused to accept <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s apology for offending Moslems with the book, affirming his call for Moslems to kill the naturalized Briton, who is reportedly in hiding under police guard. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> stopped short of actually severing ties, while its partners in the Common Market said they would recall their envoys for consultations. Many Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' portrays the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggests that he _ rather than God _ wrote the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book. The novel has been banned in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 As her 8-year-old son watched, a flaming blowtorch was forced down a woman's throat by a woman and two teen-agers apparently trying to collect a drug debt, police said.

 An experimental bone-marrow transplant that ended in death five years ago for <PERSON> David </PERSON>, the `` boy in the plastic bubble,'' is helping other children with the same immune system disorder to survive without isolation. `` His life certainly had an impact on mankind. If only our lives could have as much of an impact,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s primary physician at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Children's Hospital <PERSON> David </PERSON> was born with severe combined immune deficiency syndrome, or SCIDS, a disorder that left him without protection against disease. At the time, children with the disorder died because there was no treatment. Doctors placed <PERSON> David </PERSON> in a clear plastic bubble immediately after birth and increasingly bigger bubbles as he grew to protect him from germs while researchers worked on a treatment. <PERSON> David </PERSON>, whose family name was never released to the public, died Feb. 22, 1984, of blood cancer contracted shortly after he underwent a bone-marrow transplant designed to free him from the bubble. No other child lived like <PERSON> David </PERSON> and, because of the treatment, there has not been another `` bubble boy.'' Today, at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, many children with SCIDS are being treated successfully with the improved transplant treatment, <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. A handful of hospitals across the country also perform the transplant. Gone are the strict sterile conditions that made <PERSON> David </PERSON> a prisoner of his disorder. Children with the condition stay in the hospital before and after transplant. Visitors need only wash their hands and be healthy. SCIDS also is being identified earlier, thanks to pediatricians who are more aware of the disorder. `` When they see children who have unusual infections, they think maybe this child has a similar problem -LRB- to <PERSON> David </PERSON> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. About one out of 100,000 babies have SCIDS. The treatment involves taking about a quart of bone marrow from a donor, either a sibling or a parent, and injecting it into a vein. If the transplant is successful, cells known as lymphocytes in the marrow form the core of a healthy immune system. Sixteen children have been treated at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Children's in the past five years, including one boy who successfully underwent the procedure while <PERSON> David </PERSON> was dying. Eleven are still alive. Three-month-old <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was released from the hospital three weeks ago after receiving a marrow transplant. `` She is fat and sassy, doing well,'' <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said neither he nor <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s parents look back at whether anything could have been done differently. `` They went for a chance at the time when the technology was right,'' the doctor said, `` and for one reason or another, it worked out in a very sad way.''

At the meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with Egyptian counterpart <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> explained a proposal for convening an international peace conference, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s three-day <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> visit is the busiest leg of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour designed to advance Soviet proposals for regional peace. The tour has taken him to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, and he will later visit <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met for three hours with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. He has scheduled separate meetings in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on Wednesday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. In today's talks, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` agreed on the importance of moving the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> position and convincing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of the importance of peace, withdrawal from the occupied territories and giving Palestinians self-determination,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said. At a dinner speech Monday night, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` Here, where the eye is deceived at times by the desert mirage, there must be no room for political illusions.'' `` The peaceful horizons of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are not imaginary, not a mirage. Their concept is based on a conscious and realistic realization of supreme responsibility for the destinies of peoples.'' He said all parties to the conflict should abandon mutual `` doubts and suspicions and display a will and readiness to have a civilized dialogue.'' He spoke in Russian, but his speech was distributed in Arabic translation. <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> also spoke of `` a rare historic opportunity'' to forge a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> unveiled a plan to convene a U.N.-sponsored conference, with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation, within nine months.

It also says it will not meet the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` stressed the importance of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s role in preparing for the international conference,'' the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> official said of today's talks <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> Monday night, told reporters afterward that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> still disagreed with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on the role of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in peace talks. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is expected in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon at roughly the time <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> is to leave for home.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will for the first time visit the Chernobyl power plant, site of the world's worst the nuclear disaster, during his current trip to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> found out Monday in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, that the dangers of nuclear power are still very much on the minds of Ukrainians. In a street encounter broadcast by Soviet television, an elderly woman asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> why another nuclear power plant was being built in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>. The area contains some of the country's most popular beach resorts and is home to 2 million people. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was aware of worries about the plant's safety. He also said American specialists who helped plan nuclear power plants in earthquake-prone <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had been asked to study the Crimean facility. `` Construction is under way,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` But if the conclusion -LRB- of the specialists -RRB- is that it is not advisable to build a station there, then it will be turned into a training center for personnel, not an atomic power station.'' He assured the woman that the government now takes a cautious approach to nuclear power. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said today that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was preparing visits to <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, a nearby town built to house plant workers. The broadcast did not say exactly when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, where an explosion and fire at a nuclear reactor on April 26, 1986 killed at least 31 people and sent a radioactive cloud around the world. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today arrived in <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, a center of railway engineering, automobile assembly and oil refining. The city of 753,000 residents is about 260 miles west of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began his trip Monday. Last month, 10 Soviet scientists wrote a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda calling for construction of the Crimean plant to be stopped. They said it was not designed to withstand earthquakes of the magnitude possible there. Since the Chernobyl accident, the Soviets have moved away from complete faith in the safety of nuclear power, and public opposition to it has grown. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukonin </PERSON>, the nuclear power minister, announced in December that six projects to build nuclear plants or add more reactors at existing stations had been scrapped because of earthquake danger or tougher standards. The Soviet press is also increasingly reporting on the growing health problems from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said cancer cases have doubled and calves are often born without heads and limbs in a region 30 miles from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> where people were not evacuated during the disaster. Also at Monday's street encounter in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the confusing electoral system he ushered into law in December already needs reform. `` We will review the results of the campaign, carry out the necessary corrrections,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He was not specific. The new law creates a 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a two-thirds of whose members will be elected by the public on March 26. One-third of the deputies, however, will be chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its affiliates, unions, social and political organizations.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Tapes Dispute Paramedics In Boy's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The attorney for the mother of a boy who died during an asthma attack says emergency dispatcher tapes prove paramedics were not attacked before they refused to enter a housing project to help the child. However, the speech pathologist who prepared a transcript of the tapes found a key segment was unintelligible, and neither supported nor contradicted the paramedics' contention that they were driven away by a barrage of eggs and rocks. The 9-year-old boy's mother, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarnagin </PERSON>, has said there was no such attack on the ambulance on Dec. 12, when her son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, was stricken. Her attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kremin </PERSON>, contends that the tape recordings, which were released publicly at a news conference Monday, refute the Fire Department paramedics' version, which has been supported by city officials. On the recording, neither paramedic says anything about being the target of missiles, <PERSON> Kremin </PERSON> said. The Fire Department, which oversees emergency medical activities, `` is still vigorously defending the paramedics and their actions,'' spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaGreca </PERSON> said after the tapes and transcripts were released. `` It was a sad, sad case but we feel our people were correct in their actions and our policy is sound.'' He declined to comment further, citing the $ 60 million lawsuit filed by Mrs. <PERSON> Jarnagin </PERSON> against the department and the city. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubnick </PERSON>, an attorney for the city, said <PERSON> Kremin </PERSON> was wrong. `` There's no doubt in my mind. They did the proper thing,'' he said of the paramedics. But <PERSON> Kremin </PERSON> said more than a dozen witnesses will swear that nothing was thrown at the rescue workers. The recordings cover about 32 minutes of telephone and radio conversations among the two paramedics, the ambulance dispatcher, the Police Department and the boy's relatives, who made eight calls to an emergency number Dec. 12. According to the transcript <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> speech pathologist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrell </PERSON> prepared from recordings <PERSON> Kremin </PERSON> said he had obtained from city authorities, Ms. <PERSON> Jarnagin </PERSON> initially called at 4:14 p.m.. She requested an ambulance at the <ORGANIZATION> Dearborn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> housing project on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, saying her son was having a severe asthma attack and losing consciousness About five minutes later, an ambulance was dispatched, followed by a police squad car, the tapes show. At 4:28 p.m., one of the paramedics radioed the dispatcher that they were leaving the housing project. In <PERSON> Carrell </PERSON>'s transcript, the exchange goes: Ambulance: Uh, we had a -LRB- unintelligible -RRB- we're leaving the scene. Dispatcher: I'll get the police in there. Ambulance: No, we're not hanging around. We're leaving the scene. There is no indication on the tapes that officers in the police car saw any attack on the ambulance. At 4:30, Mrs. <PERSON> Jarnagin </PERSON> called again, sobbing. Mother: There was an ambulance here and they left! They did n't even come upstairs After getting the address, the dispatcher tells her: You know why? People were beating up the paramedics, ma'am. Mother: Huh? What people? ... There was no one out there. My son went out there. According to the tapes, the police officers entered the fifth-floor apartment minutes later and radioed at 4:32 p.m. to request an ambulance. The same ambulance was directed to return to the housing project, the tapes show. The unconscious boy was picked up and taken to a hospital, where he died.

 A small earthquake rattled suburbs south of here, but there were no reports of damages or injuries, authorities said. The quake at 10:48 p.m. Monday was centered about 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and registered 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at Golden, Colo. The qauke was felt in Federal Way, <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Enumclaw </LOCATION> and Skyway, the center said. State Patrol offices in <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, however, said they received no phone calls from residents living in the area. The last quake in the Puget Sound area occurred last Tuesday, and was centered near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. It measured 4.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and also caused no damage or injuries. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> will be laid to rest Friday in an elaborate ceremony modeled on Shinto rituals chosen by few modern Japanese when departing this world. Only 7 percent of all Japanese are mourned with the rituals of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ancient indigenous Shinto beliefs; 90 percent are remembered with <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> ceremonies and another 3 percent with Christian services, says <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokoyama </PERSON>, an official of the All <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Funeral Directors Cooperative. Buddhism, brought to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about 1,300 years ago, has been the predominant religion in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for centuries, coexisting with Shinto folk beliefs. From 1600 to 1867, families were required to be registered at <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples, and priests became responsible for funeral rites. Even the imperial family, who are believed to be descended from <LOCATION> Shinto </LOCATION> gods, long observed <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> memorial services until the government established Shinto as a state religion in 1868. Traditionally, Japanese place the ashes of the deceased in stone family tombs similar to those used in Western Christian cemeteries, but attitudes toward the dead differ greatly from those in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. According to Shinto and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> beliefs, failure to provide proper funeral rites will deny the dead their final rest. Spirits that are not properly cared for will return to haunt the living, it is believed. A death in a Japanese family is usually announced with a notice in black and white on the door. A mortuary is summoned to prepare a wake, which is usually held in a temple or in the home. A white reception tent is often erected and black-and-white funeral wreaths on tall poles surround the home. A black suit and tie, and for women, a black kimono or dress with white pearls is the customary attire. Unlike <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose body was sealed in a coffin after his death Jan. 7, most Japanese are cremated before burial. The custom of embalming does not exist in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and cremation is believed to purify the soul. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and most other cities require that bodies be cremated due to a lack of space for gravesites. An urn containing the cremated remains is placed in the family grave. The tradition of giving `` koden'' or incense money to a bereaved family persists because funerals are costly, ranging from about $ 1,600 for simple services held at home to about $ 60,000 for a deluxe funeral in a temple. For seven weeks after death, the spirit is believed to hover nearby. If proper rites are observed over the years, it eventually goes to a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> afterworld or joins the pantheon of ancestral Shinto gods the Japanese believe influence the living. Reverence for the dead, or ancestor worship, is a way of life in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that could perhaps be described as a way of keeping in touch with departed family members. As in many <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cultures, family members, especially eldest sons, are expected to care for the souls of their dearly departed with memorial services at specified intervals and with offerings of food, incense and prayers at gravesites and at altars in their homes. Some traditional homes have two family altars: a kamidana or `` god-shelf'' for Shinto gods, and a butsudan or Buddhist altar housing small tablets bearing the names of ancestors. Once a year in July or August, Japanese return to their home villages, where most family graves are located, and invite the spirits of their ancestors to spend the O-bon festival with them. Graves are swept and sprinkled with water in a ritual of purification. The festival is a time for family reunions and community dances that originated as a way of entertaining and pleasing ancestral gods.

 The government freed 50 more detainees today after hunger strikes were halted at two prisons, but scores of detainees continued to fast elsewhere and police said 20 were hospitalized. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he had signed release warrants for 50 detainees. He did not say how many took part in hunger strikes to demand they be freed or brought to court. About 225 detainees still are refusing food at prisons in the southern cities of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, their lawyers said. Police reported 20 hunger strikers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were hospitalized Monday, four days after they and six fellow detainees began fasting. Civil rights lawyers said about 200 detainees in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> have begun hunger strikes in the past two weeks. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has agreed to meet lawyers for the detainees, but no date has been set. The first wave of hunger strikes started Jan. 23 and involved nearly 300 detainees held without charge in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and at Diepkloof Prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Some detainees at those prisons went three weeks without food then broke their fast after <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> promised to review their cases and release `` a substantial number.'' Eight detainees were freed Friday. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has won widepsread praise, even from anti-government leaders, for agreeing to meet with lawyers, parents and clergymen representing the hunger strikers. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he would continue these discussions `` and I trust the entire hunger strike will soon be something of the past.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday visited a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> hospital where some Diepkloof hunger strikers are recovering. He said it was possible the fast would resume if the detainees were dissatisfied about the numbers released in the next two weeks. Many of the hunger strikers have been held more than two years. Under the 32-month-old national state of emergency, police can arrest anyone they believe may be a danger to the public safety. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> decides periodically, based on police reports, whether the detainee should remain incarcerated. Detainees do not have to be brought to court and charged, and they can be kept in custody for as long as the government pleases. Monitoring groups say more than 30,000 people, mostly blacks, have been detained during the state of emergency. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has never given a total figure, but he said two weeks ago that there were fewer than 1,000 people in detention at that time.

More than 20,000 people are listed as seriously affected by the leak of methyl isocyanate, and deaths attributed to it continue at the rate of at least one a day. More than 500,000 damage claims have been filed. The protesters from <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> today blocked the road to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, demanding a reversal of the Feb. 14 order that instructed the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 470 million as full and final settlement of all claims arising from the leak. The government had sued for $ 3 billion from the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company, whose Indian subisidiary owned the plant. Some of the demonstrators had not eaten since the train journey began Monday afternoon. At least five protesters were admitted to hospitals today suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion, said V.C. <PERSON> Shukla </PERSON>, a member of Parliament from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Jan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morcha </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party. Many more in the crowd looked ready to collapse and talked between gasps for breath. They complained they had no water to drink since arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Placards depicted Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on his knees before a devil throwing a coin. They proclaimed: `` Slave <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> salutes Killer Carbide.'' <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Qureishi </PERSON>, who lost two children in the gas leak, said the protesters did not accept the award and demanded the hanging of former <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> chariman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` Killers of one prime minister are hanged, but killers of thousands of people escape with only a small payment,'' he said, referring to the Jan. 6 hangings of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The government is working on how to divide the award among those who have claimed damages. <PERSON> Kaushalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahirwal </PERSON>, a leader of the women's wing of the Welfare for <ORGANIZATION> Bhopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> group, said she did not know the amount but it was `` very little.'' `` My husband is very ill, in hospital. My sister died and my mother is blinded, but we have got no money,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ahirwal </PERSON> said. `` We have been betrayed by the court,'' said <PERSON> Shukla </PERSON>, a former chief minister of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> is located. He said the protesters will march to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and would ask the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the verdict. `` We are outraged that the government should have agreed to the order without consulting even the relief agencies,'' <PERSON> Shukla </PERSON>, the opposition legislator, said. `` After losing four years, what was the sudden hurry to settle for so little?'' <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> opened a 3-month-long session today, and President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> made no mention of the Union Carbide settlement in his opening speech.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man has been sentenced to 45 years in prison for sexually assaulting his 8-year-old stepdaughter twice, including once when his wife ordered the girl to `` relax and be quiet,'' authorities said. The 23-year-old man, whose identity was withheld to protect the victim, told <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Entz </PERSON> that he had sex with the girl on five separate occasions, including one time when his wife, also 23, pinned the girl's arms back while he raped her. The man from suburban <PERSON> Mesquite </PERSON> testified that his wife had suggested having sex with the child to fulfill one of his fantasies, and he was vulnerable to the suggestion while drunk or high. A <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted the man on two charges of aggravated sexual assault with a child under 14. Defense and prosecution lawyers negotiated a plea bargain for the man to plead guilty in exchange for 45 years in prison and a $ 750 fine. Charges are pending against the child's mother. An affidavit filed with an arrest warrant for the mother stated that she had forced the girl to strip and then told her to `` relax and be quiet'' during the sexual assault. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Skor </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the mother, said his client is innocent. `` She's a battered woman,'' <PERSON> Skor </PERSON> said. The judge said he would not accept a plea bargain for the mother for less than 45 years in prison.

<HEAD>California Town Sets Up Computer Link Between Residents And Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Starting today <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> residents can fire off a complaint to City Hall, look for a job or check to see if the latest best seller is at the library, all by tapping a few computer keys. Touting itself as the city of the future, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> was to go on line with a computer system that will allow residents with personal computers a direct hook-up with City Hall. Officials say they will answer each computerized missive with a reply sent to that person's own computer. But residents can use the system to do more than complain about municipal problems. They can comb the computer network to find out such things as where to get parking permits and dog licenses, what events are scheduled at the pier and the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>, which city agencies are hiring, and whether or not the books they want to pick up at the local library have already been checked out. Eventually, the system will be used to apply for licenses and permits, said Assistant City Manager <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrette </PERSON>. The idea is the brainchild of community activist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` This is a marvelous way to access the -LRB- city -RRB- staff reports,'' said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who suggested the computer network two years ago. `` You can play a truly effective role. People who feel disenfranchised can find a way to be a part of government.'' Not all reaction to the system has been positive, however. Some officials fear the computer system will give this seaside community an an image as an elitist city catering to affluent personal computer owners. They hope to overcome that by setting up computer terminals at the library and other public centers to give everyone access. Computer experts expressed concern that neither the public nor bureaucrats may be ready for such an innovation. `` It may overburden ambivalent department heads and city employees who want to be responsive but are n't getting additional resources,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, a social scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>'s Rand <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> think tank. The cost of setting up the system has been nil, however. The $ 350,000 system, called <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, was a gift from two computer companies. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> provided the hardware and <ORGANIZATION> Metasystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> donated the software programs. The system is designed to work with any model personal computer. There is no charge to use the network, although frequent users will see their phone bills increasing, officials said.

<TEXT>
 After weeks of amorous but clumsy courting, a female <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor laid an egg scientists hope will prove fertile and produce a condor chick for the endangered species' captive breeding program The egg was noticed Monday after <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo researchers reviewed a videotape of activity in the condor's plywood nest box and briefly saw it as the condors traded places from the nest to the outside. The couple, a male condor named <PERSON> Cuyama </PERSON> and a female named <PERSON> Cachuma </PERSON>, had piqued the interest of observers on Sunday when they showed signs indicating an egg-laying was near. `` They were showing great interest in each other, nibbling each other and following each other around to the nest box and scraping around as though making a nest in the sand,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, curator of birds at the zoo and supervisor of its captive condor breeding program. He said the egg was the first for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo program. A condor egg laid in captivity was hatched last year in the program at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. Only 28 of the endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors remain alive, 14 in captivity at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo and 14 more in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Scientists hope the vultures, which are <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land birds with 9 -LCB- - foot wingspans, will reproduce enough so that some can be returned to the wild in five to 10 years The breeding program has removed all known <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors from the wild. Environmentalists have complained that other captive breeding programs have met with only limited success. The egg will be removed from the nest and placed in incubation sometime Wednesday, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. As part of the breeding program, scientists hope to have the birds produce as many as three fertilized eggs during the January to April mating season. `` If you remove the first egg as soon as it's laid, they will recycle and go into another mating ritual, and within 30 days lay another egg,'' he explained. Experts will know in seven to 10 days whether the egg placed in the incubator is fertilized, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. If it is, the chick should hatch in 55 to 66 days. <LOCATION> Cuyama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cachuma </PERSON>, both 6 years old and new to the courting ritual, have shown an interest in each other for the past few weeks, with <LOCATION> Cuyama </LOCATION> waltzing around <LOCATION> Cachuma </LOCATION> with outstretched wings, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` We had seen attempts on -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuyama </LOCATION>'s -RRB- part to copulate, but they were not good ones because it's his first time and he's learning how,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. The other six condor couples at the zoo also have been in courtship over the past week.

 An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> judge ruled that the widow of writer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> has done her part to settle a contract dispute with an independent publishing house over a collection of her husband's stories The order from <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> fulfilled her obligation to <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> by providing it 15 uncollected stories of her choosing, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The publisher had planned a volume of 68 stories but was stopped from bringing it out last year when Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> sued, contending the August 1987 contract was invalid because promises to her of consultation and control over the book's content had not been kept. Last September, <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> ruled that the contract was valid. He also proposed a compromise under which Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> would submit 12 to 15 of the 68 stories. Last week, he ruled that the stories she submitted fulfilled that obligation. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavens </PERSON>, a lawyer for the publishers, said <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> had not decided whether to appeal. Mrs. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbus </PERSON>, said she was now free to edit her husband's stories in a collection of her own. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1979, died in 1983.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdel-Magid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> has resigned, charging the government's reluctance to negotiate an end to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s southern civil war has isolated the country, two newspapers reported today. The independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ayam </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> quit after returning from an unannounced visit to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where he apparently was refused new military and financial aid. <PERSON> Al-Adwa </PERSON>, another independent newspaper, said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>'s letter of resignation charged `` the foreign policy adopted by the government does not lead to a unified internal front nor to stability, and has also led to the isolation of the country both in the Arab and outside world.'' The newspapers quoted Information Minister <PERSON> Beshir </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> as saying Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> has accepted <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>'s resignation. He did not name a successor. <PERSON> Al-Ayam </PERSON> speculated that <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> will assume the defense portfolio he held from the time he was elected prime minister in 1986 to June 1988, when he appointed <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to attend the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> because of the `` emergency circumstances,'' according to <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>'s statement. Vice President <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> <PERSON> Banna </PERSON> and the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will represent him at the funeral, the statement said. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>'s letter said government policies `` have weakened the country's ability to acquire military and economic assistance ... `` The government's rejection of the peace plan and its reluctance to move in the direction of peace in the country has affected <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s reputation in the outside world.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this month urged an end to the almost 6-year-old civil war and said it would try to promote a peace settlement. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has linked further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to ending the war, and other friendly Western and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> donors say there is an urgent need to end the fighting. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, the U.S.-educated renegade colonel who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, signed a peace plan Nov. 16 with <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Moslem guerrillas fired rockets on the capital today on the ninth anniversary of an uprising against the Soviet-backed government. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the attack killed one person and injured three. The bombardment was the first since Thursday, when a barrage of rockets killed at least seven people, including four children. The last Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported that one rocket today struck near a government ministry for refugees in northern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing one man and injuring three other people. Three rockets hit southeastern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but there were no reports of casulties. Earlier, the government displayed a huge cache of arms and explosives devises and said the guerrillas had planned to use them today to attack buildings and bazaars. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> took foreign reporters to the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION>, the government's secret police, where it had lined up the wide array of weapons on several tables. Many had markings from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Officials said others were made in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the most powerful guerrilla groups are based. According to <PERSON> Moammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, a state security agent, the weapons were seized Monday in a well in eastern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He said agents captured three guerrilla sympathizers who confessed to planning to use the devices to attack government buildings and markets around the city today and Wednesday. The guerrillas hold most of the countryside, while government troops control major cities. The 1980 revolt occurred two months after Soviet troops intervened to bolster a Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Soviet soldiers fired on Moslem protesters who emerged from their homes shouting `` God is Great!'' Government officials say dozens of people were killed. Around the city today, business was brisk in some shops but light in others. Some closed for the occasion. Authorities stepped up security around the city, sending more soldiers to marketplaces. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> said security agents received a tip that guerrillas and sympathizers had stored weapons and explosive devices in a well. He said they searched eight days before finding the arms. Among the weapons were 113 pounds of plastic explosives that agents said came from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Chinese-made hand grenades, British mortar shells, Egyptian rockets, Italian fuses for mines, British and Pakistani detonators, Swedish circuit testers, Chinese Kalashnikov rifles, and British pistols. There were also political pamphlets. Officials also showed several fliers they said the guerrillas distributed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week suggesting that rockets attacks were imminent. One, printed in English and the local language <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION>, said: `` We will contine our Jihad -LRB- holy war -RRB- until the withdrawal of the last Soviet soldier.'' The final Soviet troops, once estimated at more than 100,000 in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, withdrew Wednesday under a U.N.-mediated accord. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of stepping up its supply of weapons to the guerrillas, who have rejected offers of power-sharing and vowed to overthrow the government. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared a state of emergency and shook up his government to consolidate control.

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Review Ruling On Iranian Assets Procedure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to referee a dispute between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and American businesses stemming from the 1981 settlement of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis. The court said it will review a ruling that businesses recovering money from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government do not have to pay a portion of it to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> included release by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets. The settlement also set up a process permitting those with claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to take them to an international tribunal. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 upheld the power of former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to approve the settlement. That question was not at issue in the case acted on today, in which <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> made a claim against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The companies leased computer systems to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the 1970s, before the hostage crisis severed relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. After the hostages were freed in January 1981, the <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> corporations were awarded $ 2.8 million by the international tribunal set up to handle claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 passed a law requiring those who win such claims to pay to the federal government 1.5 percent of the first $ 5 million recovered and 1 percent of amounts over that. The fee is to reimburse governmental expenses in helping resolve the claims. The government said the <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> corporations owed it $ 42,000. A federal appeals court here ruled last August that the fee is an unconstitutional seizure of private property by the government. `` Whatever -LRB- the fee -RRB- was thought to be, it was a taking of <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON>'s money to help settle the national crisis, a burden the government must bear on behalf of all of us,'' the appeals court said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, in seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, said tens of millions of dollars are at stake. Some $ 12.7 million already has been deducted by the government from awards to successful claimants. The government's appeal said it is reasonable to require those that win claims against <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> to defray the $ 4 million the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government spends each year to help operate the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims process. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-952.

<HEAD>Court Lets Kentucky Abortion-Notification Law Take Effect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law requiring parental notification. The justices, without comment, turned down an emergency request by `` pro-choice'' advocates seeking to block the law until a federal appeals court rules on its constitutionality. At issue was the law's provisions for parental notification and consent. As passed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the law required that unmarried girls under 18 seeking abortions first obtain the written `` informed consent'' of both parents. The law, challenged quickly by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, never has taken effect. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> last Aug. 23 ruled that the law, with certain modifications, could be enforced. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> previously had struck down the mandatory two-parent requirement, a separate provision requiring that parental consent forms be notarized and the imposition of criminal liability on any doctor who does not get the consent of both parents if both are available. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said those provisions impermissibly interfere with a girl's constitutional right to have an abortion But in his ruling last August, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the state could require that girls living with both parents get their informed consent or, as an alternative, get permission from a judge before obtaining an abortion. If the girl lives with only one parent or legal guardian, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said, she only needs the consent of that person. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s ruling is being challenged before the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, but the appeals court refused to block enforcement of the abortion regulations pending its review. In seeking emergency help, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s decision inappropriately rewrote the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law to make it pass constitutional muster. They said numerous affidavits from doctors and other health providers introduced as evidence in the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> case have `` demonstrated the burdensomeness of the informed parent consent requirement -LRB- and -RRB- the attendant increase in cost and medical risk to the minor through delay.'' The law's opponents say `` informed consent'' means that parents likely would have to visit a hospital or abortion clinic before approving of the procedure. The emergency request said the law would lead some young girls `` to delay or avoid seeking professional help and medical care'' when they believe they are pregnant. It said enforcement of the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> law should be blocked because two similar cases _ one from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> _ currently are pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The justices have not yet said whether they will grant review to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> controversies. In each of those cases, the disputed abortion laws are not in effect. The case is <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, A-582.

<HEAD>Court Votes To Resolve Dispute Over Freedom Of Information Act</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today voted to resolve a significant dispute over the Freedom of Information Act, while agreeing to keep the identities of the legal combatants a secret. The justices said they will decide whether a government law enforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor being investigated for possible fraud certain documents received from another agency. Much of the case is cloaked in secrecy _ including the identity of the contractor and the government agencies involved _ presumably to protect the contractor's reputation. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ruled last June 23 that the sought-after government documents must be released to the contractor. But Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> on Jan. 30 blocked any such release until the high court considered the government's appeal. The documents at issue are 1978 letters a government agency, referred to in court papers as the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, exchanged with the contractor, identified as <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, about the contractor's billing practices Those letters became relevant in 1986 during a grand jury investigation of possible fraudulent practices by the contractor, and they were tranferred from the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to a federal law enforcement agency, identified in court papers as <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The contractor under investigation filed an FOIA lawsuit in 1987 seeking `` all documents that are related in any way to the subject matter of the -LRB- 1978 -RRB- correspondence.'' A federal trial judge ruled against the contractor, saying release of the documents would jeopardize the grand jury investigation. But the 2nd Circuit court ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> requires surrender of the documents. An exemption in the law for materials `` compiled for law enforcement purposes'' does not apply in this case, the appeals court said, because the letters were not originally obtained or generated for law enforcement purposes. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued that the June ruling `` would seriously impair the ability of numerous federal agencies to conduct their law enforcement responsibilities'' and hinder `` an important law enforcement investigation.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1083.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Accepts Los Angeles Taxi Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> must pay damages to a taxi company that went out of business after the city intervened in a dispute between the company and its drivers. The court will review a ruling that barred <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from winning any money from the city. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> refused in 1981 to renew Golden State's taxi franchise because the cab company was snarled in a labor dispute with a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union local that represented its drivers. Golden State, with 400 cabs, had been the city's largest taxi operator until 1980. The Teamsters called a strike for the same day the city was to consider renewing the franchises of 13 cab companies. Golden State went out of business after failing to win renewal of its franchise. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 ruled that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials improperly interfered in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. The justices said then that local governments lack authority to tip the balance in labor disputes by defining what economic sanctions either side might suffer. But the high court ruling left it unclear what remedy was available to Golden State. The case went back to the lower federal courts, and last September the 9th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied compensatory damages to the defunct taxi company. The appeals court noted that a federal judge, following the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in 1986, ordered <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to grant Golden State a four-year franchise and pay the market value of the company's assets less what it received in bankruptcy proceedings. The company said that was a hollow victory since it had liquidated its assets when it went out of business. The 9th Circuit court said <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> was not entitled to compensatory damages under a federal civil rights law generally invoked by individuals rather than businesses. The appeals court said the civil rights law does not provide monetary damages in such cases for violations of the National Labor Relations Act. The appeals court also rejected the taxi company's argument that the federal courts have `` inherent power'' to award damages in such cases. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 88-840.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today threw out an emergency request by anti-abortion activists who had sought to prevent a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, man from having an abortion performed on his comatose wife. The abortion was performed earlier this month after state courts and <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> rejected the request. In a highly unusual move, the anti-abortion activists persisted in seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action even after the case was made moot by the abortion. They sought help from <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, who referred it to the full court. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-to-Life </ORGANIZATION> group, had challenged rulings that appointed <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> as legal guardian of his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. That designation allowed him to order the abortion. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, fell into a coma after suffering brain damage in a car accident Dec. 13. She was about 18 weeks pregnant when the abortion was performed.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether people who do not own property may be excluded from membership on a public body authorized to recommend a reorganization of local government in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area. The court said it will hear a challenge to the make-up of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-St </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeholders </ORGANIZATION> The board of freeholders was created to write a proposed charter for reorganizing the city and county government structure. The board also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the city and county governments. Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a referendum. Board members were ppointed by the mayor of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the county executive and the governor of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. State Representative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> resident who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder board to property owners. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, suing for himself and all others in the city and county who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law. But the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last September that the federal constitutional protection does not apply because the freeholder board does not have `` general governmental powers.'' `` The board of freeholders serves only to recommend a plan of reorganization to the voters of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' the state court said. `` It can recommend ... property taxes and sales taxes, but it can not levy and collect them. In sum, the board of freeholders has no general governmental powers.'' The state court said the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> case is not covered by past <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings that struck down property ownership as a qualification for membership on a city school board or regional airport commission.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand rulings that the public has no right to attend the so-called `` summary jury trials'' held in some legal disputes. The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by newspapers in three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> cities that trial judges should be barred from conducting such proceedings in secret. The newspapers' lawyers had asked the high court to rule, for the first time, that the Constitution provides a public right of access to judicial proceedings in civil, or non-criminal, cases. The court in 1980 ruled that the public has a right to attend criminal trials even when defendants object. The justices since have expanded that ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial proceedings in criminal cases. But the court never has ruled that such a right of access exists as well for civil trials and proceedings. The appeal acted on today stems from a 1984 lawsuit by three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> utilities against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, over the design and construction of the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> Nuclear Power Plant. The suit alleged that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> sold the utilties _ <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ a nuclear reactor container system it knew was incapable of `` operating in a safe manner.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> presided over a summary jury trial in the case, in which lawyers for both sides presented summaries of their evidence. The jury's verdict in such proceedings is advisory and non-binding unless both sides agree otherwise. The verdict is supposed to be a reliable indicator of a full trial's outcome _ sparking attempts to settle so a full trial will not be necessary. Since first introduced in 1980, summary jury trials have been used in at least 65 federal courts in about half the states. In the GE case, the judge ruled that the summary trial would be closed to the public and ordered the parties, lawyers and jurors never to reveal anything that occurred during the proceeding. He also permanently sealed the trial transcript. The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, The Dayton Daily News and The Columbus Dispatch challenged the closure, but the 6th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled against them last Aug. 18. The appeals court said summary jury trials are more akin to settlement conferences than real trials, and that the public therefore has no right to attend or see the transcript. `` There is no historically recognized of right to summary jury trials in that this mechanism has been in existence for less than a decade,'' the appeals court said, adding, `` There is general agreement that historically settlement techniques are closed procedures.'' In seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, lawyers for the three newspapers argued, `` Public confidence will be lost if judges may respond to their expanding dockets by disposing of cases through secret courtroom proceedings and permanent gag orders.'' `` This court can not expect that public confidence, so vital to an effective judiciary, will thrive where judges conduct decisive courtroom proceedings behind closed doors in permanent, court-imposed secrecy,'' the appeal contended. But lawyers for GE discounted what they called the appeal's `` great flourishes of hyperbole,'' and urged the justices to reject it The case is <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> vs. GE, 88-813.

 Leftist guerrillas bombed the headquarters of an army brigade in the capital today, killing two civilians and wounding three others, authorities said. Rebels also used rocket-propelled grenades and rifle fire in a pre-dawn attack on a military engineers' base in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of the capital. Radio reports said the assault killed three soldiers. The rebel attack on the 1st army brigade base, which killed an elderly couple who live nearby, was the fifth since November on a major military installation in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. As in the earlier attacks, guerrillas used pickup trucks fitted with a catapult-like device to launch the bombs against the 1st brigade. The detonation of one explosive charge launches the bombs and simultaneously blows up the vehicle. Two vehicles exploded today, killing <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, about 70 years old, and his wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, about 65. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s body lay on the sidewalk in front of his home an hour after the vehicle parked in front of it exploded. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, whose legs were blown off by the blast, died on the way to the hospital, said Col. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>, who commands the 4,000-troop brigade. Three civilians were wounded by the explosions, <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON> said. The bombs launched by the vehicles did not fall inside the grounds of the 1st brigade, he said. Journalists were denied entry to the installation to verify the report. The explosions damaged about 10 homes, breaking windows, gouging walls and blowing doors off hinges. In <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, Marxist-led guerrillas and soldiers battled for three hours near the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Detachment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, radio reports said. Radio <ORGANIZATION> YSU </ORGANIZATION> reported from the scene that rebels hit an army truck with a rocket-propelled grenade, killing two soldiers inside. The radio said another soldier was killed in the fighting. There was no immediate word on army wounded or civilian or guerrilla casualties. The attacks came as two guerrilla commanders and representatives of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s political parties began a second day of meetings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to discuss a rebel proposal to postpone the March 19 presidential election. The rebels say they are willing to end a decade-long election boycott if the vote is postponed and security conditions guaranteed. The 9-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let states and state agencies be sued for alleged violations of federal copyright law. The court, without comment, turned away a <LOCATION> Radford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, case that highlighted a conflict between the Constitution's 11th Amendment shielding states from federal lawsuits and copyright law requiring all suits be filed in federal court. Photographer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Radford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a state-run school, and some school officials over the unauthorized use in 1982 of copyright photographs. A federal trial judge dismissed the school and its officials as defendants, ruling that the 11th Amendment protects them against such suits. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the dismissal by a 2-1 vote last July 20. The appeals court noted a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may abrogate the states' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not do so in passing the Copyright Act of 1976, the appeals court said. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> argued that the 4th Circuit court misinterpreted the 1976 copyright law. They said the law was intended to make states generally accountable for copyright violations. `` Because the jurisdiction of the federal courts is exclusive -LRB- in copyright cases -RRB- the effect of the 11th Amendment defense is not simply to relegate the injured party to a suit in state court but to deny any damage recovery at all against state infringers,'' the appeal said. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presses </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sided with <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in `` friend of the court'' briefs. `` Whenever the 11th Amendment has previously been found to preclude federal court jurisdiction some other forum has been available,'' one of those briefs told the justices. `` For -LRB- <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> -RRB- and all others holding copyrights, however, no relief can be sought in state courts.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photography </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Radford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 88-651.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain said today he would have rescued Vietnamese boat people his ship found in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> if he had been correctly informed of their desperate plight. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, accused critics of unfairly judging him in hindsight. He has been before a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> court-martial since Feb. 10 on charges of failing to adequately assist the more than 80 Vietnamese refugees his ship, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dubuque </ORGANIZATION>, encountered June 9 as it sailed for the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Thirty-one of the refugees died and survivors resorted to cannibalism before they were rescued by Filipino fishermen June 27 after 37 days at sea, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, his voice choking with emotion, said if he had known the desperate conditions aboard the Vietnamese craft, `` there is no doubt in my mind I would tow them to my side and embark them. That's what I did on two previous occasions. He said he ordered his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Halter </PERSON>, to determine if the refugee boat was seaworthy. `` Finally, the report came back ` no engine,' and I surmised they had a good sail,'' <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> said. He also said he was told `` they could make it on their own if we gave them food and water,'' which were provided. Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> insisted he was not responsible for the refugees resorting to cannibalism. `` I am being charged with giving insufficient assistance,'' he said. `` What is sufficient assistance? You're saying I should have embarked them. I should have embarked them _ on hindsight.'' During the afternoon session, trial judge Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON> rejected a prosecution attempt to offer as evidence a fitness report on <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON> said out of the jury's presence that the report was `` highly prejudicial'' and implied <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was guilty. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was relieved of command of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> in August after the Vietnamese reported the incident to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He was acquitted Thursday of a charge of failing to assist a Vietnamese who drowned. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> today denied allegations that he ordered crew members not to throw life rings to some of the Vietnamese who swam toward the ship. He said he did order an interpreter to tell swimmers to move away for fear they would be injured by the ship's propellers. He also denied previous testimony by a crew member, Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilano </PERSON>, that he had advised the Vietnamese simply to follow the sun to reach land. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> said he ordered the interpreter to give the refugees a navigational chart and mark their position.

<HEAD>Court, in Illinois Case, Backs FDA Rules on Animal Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to impose strict controls on the use of drugs by veterinarians for `` experimental'' treatment of some animal diseases. The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> drug distributing company that the government wrongly is interfering with the treatment of serious animal illnesses. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> seized a large quantity of drugs July 9, 1986, from <ORGANIZATION> Schuyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rushville </LOCATION>, Ill. The drugs are in bulk form. Veterinarians mix them with other drugs to create new medications to treat certain diseases for which the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has not approved finished drugs. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which upheld the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> seizure last July, said the federal agency had `` looked the other way for decades'' in declining to enforce rules against the veterinarians. But the appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> reacted to the growing practice of mixing experimental drugs by deciding to cut off supplies. <ORGANIZATION> Schuyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> acts as a middleman, purchasing the unblended drugs from the manufacturer and selling them to veterinarians. <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> was accused of violating <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations that require drug labels to carry directions for their use. The bulk drugs do not carry directions. The company said preventing veterinarians from mixing their own drugs could have `` devastating consequences for the animals that provide the basics of the American food supply.'' <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON> said there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat acute inflammations, respiratory infections and other diseases that can wipe out dairy herds and other cattle. But the federal agency defended its cautious approach to licensing new drugs for treating animals. It can take years of testing to determine, for example, whether new animal drugs can cause cancer in humans who consume the animal products, federal officials said. The 7th Circuit court, while noting that `` many veterinarians find this state of affairs deplorable,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is acting within its powers. `` No individual veterinarian will possess complete knowledge of the efficacy of a novel drug compound _ let alone of its persistence in the food chain,'' the appeals court said. <ORGANIZATION> Schuyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> failed to show that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> policy is arbitrary or capricious, the appeals court said. The case is 9 @ 1 <ORGANIZATION> KG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-614.

 Television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> failed today in his <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bid to kill a $ 90 million lawsuit by a defrocked evangelist who <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> accused of adultery in 1986. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s suit against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and others unconstitutionally entangles <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state courts in matters of church doctrine and discipline. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> was a pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> accused him of `` immoral dalliances'' with several women. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> resigned from his ministry a day after a July 1986 meeting of church leaders in which <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> aired his allegations and <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> admitted to one instance of immoral conduct. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and other Assembly of God officials did not consider <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s resignation valid, however, and he was formally dismissed only after the accusations were read to his congregation. In February 1988, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> himself tearfully confessed to an undisclosed sin. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute later said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to perform sex acts while he watched. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last April 8 after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at least a year. He returned to his ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and resumed his television programs. But the fortunes of <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> have not recovered fully from the 1987 scandal. Last month, Penthouse magazine published an article in which a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> stripper told about performing sexual acts for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. Calling her story `` diabolical and slanderous fiction,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has threatened to sue the magazine. He also said his television ministry would end this month unless he received enough donations to overcome `` pornographers'' who are trying to sabbotage his broadcasts. <PERSON> Penthouse </PERSON> said the stripper, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>, detailed the alleged relationship with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> in a deposition for lawyers representing <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> in his lawsuit against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> contends, among other things, that he was defamed and libeled by <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and the 13 other defendants sought to have <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s suit dismissed, arguing that it violates religious freedoms for courts to preside over disputes stemming from church discipline. `` The secular courts are without jurisdiction to hear his claim,'' lawyers for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> contended. The cases are <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, 88-1080, and Treeby vs. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, 88-1058.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie producer who hired actors to peform sex acts in a pornographic film. The justices, without comment, let stand a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s conviction on charges of procuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedom of expression. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is in the business of producing and marketing `` adult'' films. He produced and directed a 1983 film called `` Caught From Behind, Part II. For the movie, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> hired actors and actresses who, as part of their roles, engaged in various sex acts. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors charged <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> with five counts of pandering, based on his hiring five actresses who performed in the movie. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was not charged with any violation of the state's obscenity laws, and the movie was not formally judged to be obscene <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail amd five years probation. He also was ordered to pay $ 10,000 in restitution and a $ 100 fine. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s conviction last Aug. 25, ruling that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s pandering law should not have been applied to him. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was not procuring people for the purpose of prostitution, the state court said, because `` there is no evidence -LRB- he -RRB- paid the acting fees for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, his own or the actors.'' The state court added that even if what the film's participants engaged in could be classified as prostitution, `` the application of the pandering statute to the hiring of actors to perform in the production of a non-obscene motion picture would impinge unconstitutionally upon First Amendment values.'' The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and expression. On Feb. 1, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> turned down an emergency request by county prosecutors seeking to postpone the effect of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling until their formal appeal was considered. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> predicted that the prosecutors' formal appeal would be rejected because the state court ruling was based on an interpretation of state law, and was thus `` binding upon this court.'' The cases are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 88-1054, and <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 88-1050.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state troopers claim the costs of their workday meals as tax deductions. The justices, without comment, rejected government lawyers' arguments that lower court rulings allowing the deductions `` invited innumerable claims'' by the millions of Americans who eat meals while on the job <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> troopers <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillsbury </PERSON> claimed such deductions for the tax years 1981 and 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> denied the claims, but in a subsequent lawsuit seeking tax refunds a federal trial judge and the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled for the troopers. <PERSON> Christey </PERSON> had deducted $ 962.66 and $ 880.28, respectively, for his meals while on duty. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> claimed $ 944 and $ 968, respectively, for the same years. Both men made their claims under that part of the Internal Revenue Code allowing deductions for `` ordinary and necessary business expenses.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 ruled that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state troopers could not claim the costs of their on-duty meals as tax deductions, but that case was decided on another portion of the tax code. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> troopers are required to eat their meals in a public restaurant adjacent to a highway whenever practical. They must report by radio before beginning their meals, and make sure they supply the telephone number or code number of the restaurant where they are eating. No more than two troopers may eat together, and they must eat at certain times. They may not bring meals from home. In its ruling last March 2, the 8th Circuit court acknowledged that the costs of someone's meals most often is a personal expense and not tax-deductible. But the appeals court agreed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> that `` the number of duty-related restrictions and requirements concerning their meals effectively extended the performance of the troopers' duties from patrol cars on highways to tables in restaurants.'' The appeals court added, `` This is not a case in which the taxpayers are attempting to deduct the cost of their meals merely because they are working overtime, or working through their meal break, or where business activities make meals at home inconvenient.'' In seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the appeals court was wrong, and that meal costs are personal _ not business _ expenses. `` The troopers expended these funds because they were hungry, not because the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> required it,'' the government appeal said. `` The meals were a personal benefit to them just like the meals that other types of workers consume during the workday.'' The appeal contended that the lower court rulings `` invited innumerable claims for their deduction, depending upon the outcome of an undefined inquiry into the almost infinite variety of circumstances of each person's employment.'' Government lawyers said the appeals court ruling `` encourages substantial factbound litigation, which will have major deleterious effects on tax administration.'' The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Christey </PERSON>, 88-1023.

<TEXT>
 About 7,000 people returned to their homes today after they had been evacuated because of a stinking gas from a refinery's leaking crude oil tank, police said. The evacuation order was lifted at 5:30 a.m., police officer <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said. `` All the roads are reopened. Everything is back to normal as it was before the leak.'' The gas, which escaped Monday from a leaking tank at a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> refinery, contained hydrogen sulfide, a flammable, poisonous chemical that smells like rotten eggs. The leak, first discovered in the afternoon, was not considered a serious health threat, but at least 24 people were examined at local hospitals, officials said. No serious injuries were reported. An estimated 5,000 to 7,000 people were asked to leave their homes in this coastal city near the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> border, and about 3,000 stayed in emergency shelters overnight, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>. The rest found lodging on their own. Police barricaded a 17-by-14-block area in the western portion of the heavily industrial city. `` We've had some real bad fires at these plants where people were injured and killed, but even then we never had an evacuation of this magnitude and I've been here 28 years,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>. `` We decided to evacuate the entire area simply as a safety precaution,'' he added. `` There are a lot of elderly people who live in that particular area and there are two or three -LRB- public -RRB- housting complexes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had been monitoring air quality in the area of the leak since early Monday afternoon, and described the gaseous release as carrying a miminum risk but a terrible odor. `` Most crude oils in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have sulphur in them, and that means their gas contains hydrogen sulfide, which is listed as one of the hazardous chemicals,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. `` We're doing continuous monitoring and we're finding that there's nothing there that is hazardous to health and we're also finding that the hydrocarbon smell in the air is lessening,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` But the odor got so strong that the city emergency response unit decided to go ahead and evacuate people downwind of it.'' <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said doctors treated 20 people, many of whom complained of headaches, watery eyes or breathing difficulties. Four patients also were treated at Doctors Hospital. A <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> employee discovered the leak around 1:30 p.m. Monday and reported it around the same time that the first calls began arriving at police headquarters, officials said. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said the leaking tank has a capacity of about 300,000 gallons, but its exact content was not known because it was connected to an automatic pump that fed into a refining unit. Crews were using vacuum trucks this morning to remove the spilled crude from a ditch surrounding the tank. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> estimated the task could take two or three days to complete.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by mining companies seeking an exemption from federal environmental rules for certain hazardous wastes. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> must regulate the wastes. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July that a 1980 federal law exempting some `` high volume, low hazard'' mining wastes from environmental rules does not apply to six types of waste produced from smelting. The appeals court said the exemption does not apply to six types of dust, sludge and other waste from the smelting of copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, ferrochromium and ferrochromium-silicon. In a victory for environmental groups, the appeals court overturned an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decision and ordered the agency to apply hazardous-waste rules to the six types of smelter waste. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kennecott </ORGANIZATION> said the 1980 law was intended to apply to `` all mining industry processing wastes.''

 Searchers battling treacherous swamps today could not find survivors or bodies near the wreckage of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane that crashed with eight people on board, officials said. The C-141B Starlifter crashed three miles north of this base Monday night while coming in for a landing, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The plane was from <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The fate of the eight people on the aircraft _ seven crew members and a retired military passenger who boarded the plane during a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> _ remained unknown, officials said. `` I understand it's about five feet of water, underbrush and a swamp area, just difficult getting through on land,'' said Technical Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON>, adding search crews still had found no sign of the fliers by mid-morning. `` It's just too early to make any kind of a guess'' on the chances of finding anyone alive, said Capt. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a base spokesman. The wreckage did not appear to be spread out and the C-141B's large, distinctive T-shaped tail was intact, said Capt <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> of the 1st Special Operations Wing at <LOCATION> Hurlburt </LOCATION>, who was in charge of the search. Small fires still burned hours after the crash. Controllers at adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> lost radio and radar contact with the plane around 8 p.m. CST Monday as it was on final approach to this base 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, officials said. The first rescuers did not reach the area of the crash until 12:30 a.m. The search was suspended about four hours later, and was to resume at daylight. The searchers, who had to climb down ropes from hovering helicopters, found `` just terrible terrain, terrible conditions,'' said <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>. `` It's stumps and rocks and fallen trees.'' He said bulldozers would attempt to plow a path to the crash site today. `` We are having difficulty reaching the site,'' said <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>. `` The water in the area is five feet deep.'' At the time of the crash, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> heard an explosion, but <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said the sound may have been that of the plane hitting the ground. The aircraft was not carrying munitions, he said. There were thunderstorms in the area, <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said, but he declined to say if weather figured in the crash. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> safety team is investigating the accident. The first rescuers arrived in an Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. `` They've found one of the engines in a creek,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurkovic </PERSON>, a dispatcher at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which sent three rescue units to the scene. The aircraft was on a regularly scheduled flight to pick up personnel and cargo bound for <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said. The C-141B, capable of carrying up to 200 people, belonged to the 63rd <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said base spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. The four-engine plane is 168 feet long and has a wingspan of 160 feet. <PERSON> Hurlburt </PERSON> is headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>, which trains for small-unit actions behind enemy lines using specially modified helicopters and cargo planes that fly low to avoid radar detection.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear the appeal of a former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> convicted of criminal contempt for his role in a paramilitary organization. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that former Klan leader <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was denied a fair trial. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was sentenced to six months in prison and placed on probation for three years for criminal contempt. He also was sentenced to five years in prison in a subsequent case in which he pleaded guilty to illegally possessing hand grenades and issuing a `` declaration of war'' againsts blacks, Jews and homosexuals. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who testified for the government in prosecutions against other white supremacists, was placed in the federal witness protection program and given a new identity. The case acted on today stems from a 1984 lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Person </PERSON> accusing <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> with violently intimidating blacks to prevent them from exercising their rights. A court consent decree that settled the suit in 1985 barred <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and the Klan from operating a paramilitary organization or engaging in military exercises or training `` in furtherance of a civil disorder.'' About a year later, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was accused of criminal contempt for violating the consent decree. The Klan organization, meanwhile, had changed its name to the White Patriot Party. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which represented Person, filed the criminal contempt complaint and, in an unusual development, acted as prosecutor in the contempt proceeding for about two months. In June 1986, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was placed in charge of the case. <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> was allowed to continue as an assistant to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in prosecuting the complaint. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was convicted of criminal contempt after a jury heard testimony that his ultimate goal was the armed overthrow of the government. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said his rights were violated for a number of reasons. He argued that <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> continued to be in charge of the prosecution after June 1986 and was biased against him. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also said all blacks should have been barred as prospective jurors because they stood to benefit from the court order <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was charged with violating. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld his conviction last August. The appeals court said there was adequate evidence that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, and not <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, was in control of the case. The appeals court also said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> failed to show that no black could serve as an impartial juror in a case involving a white supremacist. The case is <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> vs. Person, 88-792.

 A man was arrested for vandalizing a centuries-old cemetery containing the grave of <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, authorities said today. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Guido </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was accused of knocking over six grave markers Monday night and smashing an ornament on a wall next to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s grave, which was undamaged in the attack. Officials initially had thought the man vandalized <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s grave, but later learned that a crack and chips off the corners of the tombstone were the products of age rather than vandalism, said the Rev <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laquintano </PERSON> of Christ Church. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s tombstone was undamaged, <PERSON> Laquintano </PERSON> said, and concrete chips found nearby were from a smashed ornament from the wall next to the grave. <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> was charged with institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, desecration of venerated objects and criminal trespass.

 Playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> today was convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in a rally commemorating a student who killed himself to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Czecholovakia </PERSON>'s best-known dissident, was charged with inciting people to participate in the banned Jan. 16 rally and for obstructing the duty of a public official. On the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum term of two years, on the second to another six months in prison. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was found guilty of both offenses in a one-day trial. The prosecution of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other opposition activists has gone on despite widespread criticism at home, in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and the West that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly with dissent. Seven other activists from the Charter 77 human rights committee and other independent movements also went on trial today. Authorities banned a number of Western diplomats and representatives from human rights organizations from the trials. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, 52, who helped found the Charter 77 movement, has been harassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his 1975 open letter to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> accused authorities of creating `` a bureaucratic order of gray monotony that stifles all individuality.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years in jail in 1979. Authorities have banned his plays, which are widely acclaimed in productions abroad. Earlier today, more than 100 <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> sympathizers had jammed a small stairwell leading to the courtroom, loudly cheering him police led him to the trial. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> did not take part in a Jan. 16 flower-laying ceremony in a downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> square, but was detained on the square an hour later. The seven other defendants _ all activists with Charter 77 and other independent groups _ face hooliganism charges in connection with the Jan. 16 gathering. The charges carry a maximum two-year jail sentence. The seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlier to protest the Soviet-led invasion that quashed communist reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The arrests came during a week of protests that were the largest in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Ota </PERSON> <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON>, one of the seven Charter 77 human rights group activists being tried, said what happened on Wenceslas Square `` was not a criminal act but an assault by police.'' Most of the defendants said they came separately to the square to lay flowers in <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s memory and no demonstration was planned. More than 2,000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling for the government to release the dissidents. It was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishment intellectuals sided with opposition activists in public. The trials also have drawn an official protest from the Hungarian Writers' Union, as well as criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western governments and groups. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, and 12 other European nations agreed on new human rights accords in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have charged that the trials violate the spirit of those accords. Nine independent groups in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have appealed to all 35 states that signed the new accords to protest the trials. Those on trial are Charter 77 activists <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON> and independent activists <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Penc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Placak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>, another Charter 77 activist, has been hospitalized with an undisclosed ailment and will stand trial separately later, the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported.

 Camouflaged combat fatigues replaced pastel nursing uniforms at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was called in to replace striking workers for the second time this year. `` The Guard is prepared to stay there as long as necessary,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, chief of staff for Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, after nurses and attendants at the 480-bed hospital walked out in a contract dispute Monday. Seven of the 110 Guard troops sent to the hospital had nursing training; the rest were given non-medical tasks such as feeding, washing and dressing patients. `` I think it's a very dangerous situation for patients, in fact I think it's life-threatening,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Retardation and Hospitals. `` Not all the individuals up there right now know exactly what they're doing There's not a lot of tolerance for error.'' Citing the possible harm and the illegality of strikes by state employees, the state sought a court order to force the employees to return to the hospital, which mostly handles long-term patients. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> said he would issue a ruling today after listening to lawyers from both sides present their arguments. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargnoli </PERSON>, president of Local 1350 of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said the main issue in the contract dispute is not money but the hospital's refusal to fill vacant jobs. `` We only want the state to honor its contract with us and pull together with the employees to restore normality and security here at the hospital,'' he said. Patient <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Baran </PERSON>, herself a registered nurse, said she felt comfortable about the care she was receiving. Although she did n't fault either side in the dispute, she said she was disappointed it had reached the point of a walkout However, 56-year-old Connie Prior, a quadriplegic who has been at the hospital for two years, was incensed by the walkout. `` I think this is totally uncalled for,'' Ms. Prior said. `` Number one should be the patients.'' More than a dozen acute-care patients have been transferred to other hospitals since the walkout began, and the facility has stopped admissions, officials said. Doctors reported to work as usual Monday, but about one-fifth of the 89 attendants and fewer than half the 13 licensed practical nurses showed up for the first shift, officials said. About half the 26 registered nurses honored the picket line, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state health agency. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> called out the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> late Sunday after the union voted 4-1 to reject a proposed 53-cent-an-hour raise offered in return for concessions on staffing. A previous four-day sickout ended Jan. 31 when the Guard was called in. Under the hospital's latest offer, starting salaries for attendants would go from $ 16,600 to $ 17,600, and for nurses would increase from $ 18,800 to $ 20,000, he said. Contract negotiations broke off Friday, and no new talks were scheduled. The hospital appealed for volunteers to augument the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, coordinator of hospital volunteers, said the facility was seeking about 30 general helpers and 16 nurses. Only about two dozen people volunteered Monday, said a volunteer coordinator who would not give her name. One striker, a therapist who would not give her name, said she felt no qualms about the walkout. `` I think it's for a good cause,'' she said. `` We have a medical emergency staff -LRB- on call -RRB- in case anything should happen. It's not like we're totally abandoning them.''

 Twenty-five children were rescued from a school bus trapped in raging floodwaters as more rain returned today to parts of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> not yet recovered from last week's downpours. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> spilled over its banks from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and was expected to continue rising all week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The high water and stiff current shut down a ferry and hindered barge loading. Smaller rivers were also on the rise from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> after a weekend respite from storms that had dumped up to 11 inches of rain over the area last week. The weather service issued a flash flood watch for all of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, for eastern and southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Flooding closed roads and damaged homes in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, early today, and roads were reported under water in central <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> after more than 2 -LCB- inches of rain fell Monday evening. In western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, a 19-year-old woman died Monday when she lost control of her car on a wet highway and hit a truck. In the central part of the state, which received up to 3 inches of rain in 24 hours, searchers on Monday discovered the body of one of two men missing since their van got stuck in high water in <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last Thursday. The search for the other man resumed this morning. About 50 miles west, in <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, a school bus tilted on its side in flood waters up to its midsection. The children and driver were inside the bus for at least 30 minutes before they were rescued and loaded into two small boats, according to firefighter <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulkerson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. None of the children was injured. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Daviess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy who discovered the bus, said there were some tense moments before the boats arrived because the bus was slowly sinking in the ditch. `` The boat ride was fun, but getting stuck was n't fun,'' said fifth-grader <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` It was kind of scary. A whole bunch of people were crying.'' The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> ferry between Cave In Rock, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, shut down Monday and its operator, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, predicted it would be out for at least a week. The river covered the road on the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> side, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. `` It's swift and full of trees and logs and everything else.'' Northbound river traffic was having a hard time fighting the current, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. While 10 mph is the average speed going upriver, towboats were fighting to reach speeds of 2 mph. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s high level has interfered with operations at the <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riverport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. Grain ca n't be loaded onto barges again until water levels fall enough for the barges to move under a fixed loading spout, said port director <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. Of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s major rivers, those in the western half of the state posed the greatest problems with the new rainfall because of backwater flooding from the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the weather service said. The Rolling Fork and Green rivers, in central and southwestern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, respectively, were above flood stage today. At <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, which lies just south of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said water had receded a few inches Monday, but 42 houses that had to be evacuated the day before remained flooded. The flood knocked out pumps at a waste treatment plant, causing raw sewage to be discharged into the river, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. But he said the worst appeared to be over. `` Based on our old-timers, and based on the forecast, we're not anticipating any additional flooding,'' he said. Despite the new rain, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> officials said only a few families in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area, northeast of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, had to be evacuated due to flooding. `` At 1 o'clock this morning things looked really dim,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, an operations officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had that front with all that rain coming in from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> that was supposed to hit us but it turned off and headed toward northern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> instead.'' In <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, about 130 people remained away from their homes after being flooded out last week. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> officials also found at least one bright spot. The town of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which was hard hit by last week's floods, appeared to be escaping the newest round of flooding. `` I do n't understand these things,'' said said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayler </PERSON>, operations officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, `` I just report them.'' In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, officials said parts of <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and Limestone counties experienced minor flash flooding as a wave of heavy thunderstorms passed over the area.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that states may use anti-racketeering laws to fight pornography, but invoked free-speech rights to ban the states from seizing before trial the contents of adult bookstores. The justices threw out an obscenity conviction against a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, bookstore because authorities seized its contents before trial. But by a 6-3 vote, the justices said prosecutors still may use the state's anti-racketeering law to renew the obscenity case. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the Constitution's free-speech protections do not bar states from using alleged acts of obscenity as a basis for an anti-racketeering law. `` Given that the -LRB- anti-racketeering -RRB- statute totally encompasses the obscenity law, if the latter is not unconstitutionally vague, the former can not be vague either,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. In other matters acted on today the court: _ Allowed <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law that includes provisions for parental notification. _ Refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producer for hiring actors to peform sex acts in a film. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had thrown out the conviction as violating the producer's freedom of expression. _ Rejected a constitutional attack on a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> seat belt law, letting stand a $ 35 fine against a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lawyer for not buckling up. _ The court declined to kill a $ 90 million suit against evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> by a defrocked evangelist who <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had accused of adultery. _ Let stand rulings that the public has no right to attend so-called `` summary jury trials'' held in some legal disputes. Three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> newspapers had sought to force such proceedings to be held in open court. _ Agreed to referee a dispute between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and American businesses over whether firms receiving money because of claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must pay part of the money to the <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> government. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act is patterned after the much-used federal act that bears the same acronym, RICO. States are using such laws with increasing frequency as a powerful new wepaon to fight obscenity and organized crime. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law went too far in permitting prosecutors to padlock adult bookstores before obscenity trials. While the Constitution generally permits seizure of suspected contraband material, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, `` It is otherwise when materials presumptively protected by the First Amendment are involved.'' `` Probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for seizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptively protected books and films,'' he said. In a dissenting opinion, Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the obscenity charges against <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> should be thrown out. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for all three, said <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s law violates the Constitution by permitting the seizure of a bookstore's contents after an obscenity conviction. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> noted that the law allows the seizure based on a judgment that two items sold by the store were obscene. The law allows prosecutors `` to cast wide nets and seize ... the obscene, those non-obscene yet sexually explicit -LRB- items -RRB-, even those devoid of sexual reference,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. The law was used in March 1984 against three <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> bookstores selling sexually explict material. Law enforcement officials padlocked the stores and seized all inventory. The three <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> stores were allowed to reopen in April 1985. But only one, <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, remains in business. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today also upheld rulings that permit the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, sheriff's office to charge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sappenfield </PERSON> with distributing obscene material and violating the state RICO law. That case has yet to go trial. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-470, and <LOCATION> Sappenfield </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-614.

 A teen-ager who last week said she found a newborn baby on her family's back porch has admitted she is the infant's mother and says she concocted the story because she was afraid. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 16, told police she gave birth to the 7-pound girl in the family's bathtub Thursday evening. She told her family she found the baby wrapped in a towel and left in a box on a pile of garbage bags on the doorstep when she went out to quiet a cat. `` I did n't mean to lie, but I got really scared and did n't know what to do or who to tell,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in a statement filed in <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am very sorry for all the problems that I have caused. I was just scared about this.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> apparently hid her pregnancy by wearing baggy clothes and saying she was gaining weight. She said pressure from her boyfriend, the baby's father, was one reason she hid her pregnancy, according to police investigator <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>. The girl admitted the baby was hers Monday after a doctor confronted her because she had lost 16 pounds since her last exam. She then told her mother, who called police. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was charged with falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor. She is scheduled to appear in City Court later today. The baby, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisha </PERSON>, is in good condition at Strong Memorial Hospital. She was scheduled to be released today or Wednesday, but the mother's disclosure could change that, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Meteyer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` As the biological mother, she certainly has rights. But all that has to be sorted out,'' he said.

The way it will work is I have asked him to say a few words and then I'm going to step back in and take a couple of questions and then turn it over to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> for follow-on and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> will be with him. Congressman <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, welcome. Grant: Thank you, Mr. President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: We're pleased you're here. Grant: Thank you. Well, I'm here this morning to announce that I intend to reregister as a Republican in my hometown of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, this afternoon. After a period of prolonged and careful deliberation, I have determined that I can better represent the values and the priorities of north Floridians in the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as a Republican. Please understand, I have been a Democrat all of my adult life and I want the people who have sent me to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to understand that my actions are not going to change me as a person, will not change my heritage. This action is not going to change my values, nor will it change the way that I vote. I'm registering as a Republican because I can best serve the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> and a working partnership with this president, with this administration and with this <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. I've been assured by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he will work closely and cooperatively with me to ensure that the force of his administration is brought to bear to improve the lives of the people that I represent. I'm reregistering as a Republican because I share this party's commitment _ or inclusion _ for all of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people I'm reregistering as a Republican because I share the values for which the party stands. Those values include a commitment to a strong national defense, where we're assured that our friends love us and our enemies fear us; a commitment to fair and equal opportunity for all the citizens of our land; and an unswerving commitment to fighting the crime and drug abuse that plague our society. I believe that these values are shared by the people that I represent, and I'm convinced that I can best serve them as a Republican and I'm proud to make this announcement today. Thank you.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today the allegations against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> have been `` gunned down'' by a thorough <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, and he called on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to move swiftly to confirm the former senator as secretary of defense. Fielding questions from reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had personally reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background report on Tower. `` What I got from it was that there has been a very unfair treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up,'' he said. Tower has been plagued by reports of womanizing and problem drinking and by questions about his financial ties to defense contractors. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had postponed a vote on the nomination while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was being compiled and may decide today or Wednesday when to vote. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had no immediate response to the president's declaration <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> told reporters he did n't know when the committee would act on the nomination, but noted that the delay in the confirmation proceedings had been `` at the request of the White House.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also said it was `` premature'' to speculate about whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would hold a closed-door session to review the Tower file. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was delivered on Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which forwarded it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. `` I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will move forthrightly on this nomination,'' the president said. Published reports have said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> found that Tower drank excessively in the 1970s, but no longer does so. Asked about that, and whether the former senator had undergone treatment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I say there is no evidence of any kind of disease of alcoholism. None. None whatsoever.'' Tower's nomination has become the longest-running controversy in the early weeks of the new administration, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gone out of his way today to demonstrate support for his nominee at several turns. `` I've never wavered in my support for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I'd say all of these charges we've read about have been rumor, and a lot of it vicious rumor.'' `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is qualified to be secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, he'll be a good secretary of defense ... the allegations against him that have been hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of fact,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. With his appearance in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing room, the president gave his personal stamp to what his senior aides already had been telling reporters about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. `` It was very exhaustive; interviews with anybody and everybody,'' press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of a 140-page report delivered to the White House on Monday and quickly hand-carried to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> by the president's counsel, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` It did not corroborate the personal charges against the -LRB- former -RRB- senator, nor did it show any problems with illegal campaign contributions,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions, meantime, that as a senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, profited from a lucrative oil investment arranged in 1981 by a <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> lawyer whose son was nominated to the federal bench by Tower. Towers' financial disclosure forms indicate he put up no capital and financed his entire investment with a five-year promissory note from a now-defunct <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> bank, the newspaper said. The money was used to purchase machinery which was leased to a Corpus Christi drilling firm under terms that allowed Tower to pay off the note while earning about $ 25,000 from the rental payments and resale of the equipment in 1986, it said. The newspaper, citing unidentified people familiar with Tower's finances, said the late <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> was instrumental in arranging the transaction, which closely coincided with the appointment of <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to a federal judgeship A spokesman for Tower denied there had been any `` quid pro quo'' between the oil investment and the judicial nomination, the Journal said. At the Capitol on Monday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> seemed reticent to discuss the latest development in the troubled Tower confirmation process. Just before going into a closed-door meeting with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was asked whether the White House statements made him feel pressure to move quickly to a committee vote. `` The only pressure I feel ... -LRB- is -RRB- to get the facts before making this decision,'' he replied. However, while awaiting the report, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had also said, `` We're not going to hold up a vote in the committee any longer. He and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel, indicated that if new questions arise later, they could be dealt with later in the confirmation process. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said in advance of the meeting with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> that they would make no comment to reporters afterward. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> eluded reporters after giving the report to the two senators. Although they did not elaborate on a specific timetable in brief remarks to reporters on Monday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had indicated previously that the committee might vote on the nomination by the end of the week if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was received early in the week. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has said he will bring the Tower nomination to a prompt vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor once the committee decides what it wants to do. Tower's nomination has been stalled by numerous allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing. Many senators also expressed concerns about their former colleague's close ties to defense contractors. Tower received more than $ 1 million as a consultant for major defense firms since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. Meanwhile, staff members of <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s committee met Monday with <PERSON> Berne </PERSON> <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security officer. <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> had been sent to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1986 to investigate allegations of security breaches in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to missile talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while Tower was a member of the contingent, said congressional sources who requested anonymity. On Sunday, <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> had spoken to investigators of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegations against Tower. At that meeting, the sources said, <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> corroborated a report that Tower, while in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, had used his secretaries as mistresses. The sources would not go into detail on what <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee.

 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a two-term congressman who switched to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today, represents much of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, where Republicans have been displaying increasing strength in recent elections <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 46, appeared at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who announced <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s defection from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is good news for our party not only in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, not only in the South, but nationally,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. For his part, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> told reporters at the nationally televised announcement, `` After a period of prolonged and careful deliberation, I have determined that I can better represent the values and the priorities of north Floridians in the State of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as a Republican.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s defection from the majority party, said: `` It took me by surprise, but that's everyone's choice. I hope he's happy.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was a banker from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, a rural town in northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, when he first won election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, after four years in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. His conversion tips the balance of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s delegation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, giving the state 10 Republicans and nine Democrats. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> is the second <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> congressman to switch parties in five years. Former Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> became a Republican in 1984. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s district is the largest, geographically, east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The 2nd congressional district stretches along the state's northern border from near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to just west of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and includes <LOCATION> Tallahasse </LOCATION>, the state capital. Voters in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> have long voted for Democratics in state elections but recently have been showing more support for Republican candidates, especially in the last two presidential elections. Last fall, two Republican upsets in races for traditionally Democratic congressional seats _ the 4th and 6th congressional districts _ eroded the Democrats' majority in the delegation. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Republicans gained one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s seats when <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> defeated Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> to replace the retired Democrat <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> won his seat after 12-term Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>, a Democrat, decided to retire. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> won 51 percent of the vote in a five-candidate primary. He had no Republican opponent in the general election. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> has been active in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and had figured in speculation for a possible run for governor in 1990. He drew publicity last summer for his unsuccessful campaign in support of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> for the Democratic vice presidential nomination.

 States may not offer the equivalent of patent protection for utilitarian and design ideas left unprotected by federal law, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously today. The justices killed a lawsuit in which a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> boat manufacturer charged that its design for a fiberglass recreational boat was duplicated illegally by a competitor. The court said only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and not individual states, can decide at some future date to protect certain industrial design ideas. `` It is for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to determine if the present system of design and utility patents is ineffectual in promoting the useful arts in the context of industrial design,'' Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote for the court. She said a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law that would have protected the boat manufacturer's design `` conflicts with the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bonito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 developed an original hull design that was marketed as model 5VBR. A hardwood model was created from engineering drawings, and the model was then sprayed with fiberglass to create a mold. The mold then was used to produce the finished fiberglass boats for sale. No patent was obtained for the utilitarian or design aspects of the hull, or for the process by which the hull was manufactured. After the model 5VBR proved a marketing success, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> enacted a law that, in effect, gave <ORGANIZATION> Bonita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boats </ORGANIZATION> a state-level monopoly for making hulls that way. Bonito Boats later invoked the state law in suing Thunder Craft Boats for allegedly using the same process. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> trial judge, upheld by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, threw out the lawsuit after ruling that the state law giving protection to Bonito Boats' creativity impermissibly conflicts with federal patent law Today's decision upheld the state court rulings. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has considered extending various forms of limited protection to industrial design either through the copyright laws or by relaxing the restrictions on the availability of design patents,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> noted. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> explicitly refused to take this step in the copyright laws, and despite sustained criticism for a number of years it has declined to alter the patent protections presently available for industrial design,'' she said. The case is Bonito Boats vs. Thunder Craft Boats, 87-1346.

 Playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> today was convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in a rally commemorating a student who killed himself to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Czecholovakia </PERSON>'s best-known dissident, denied charges that he incited people to `` anti-state and anti-Socialist'' activity. In the one-day trial, he was convicted of inciting participation in the banned Jan. 16 rally and for obstructing the duty of a public official. On the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum term of two years, on the second to another six months in prison. Prosecutors had asked for a one-year term, but Judge <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlavata </PERSON> ruled on a nine-month prison term and rejected a proposed fine. The prosecution of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other opposition activists has gone on despite widespread criticism at home, in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and the West that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly with dissent. Seven other activists from the Charter 77 human rights committee and other independent movements also went on trial today. Authorities banned a number of Western diplomats and representatives from human rights organizations from the trials. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, 52, who helped found the Charter 77 movement, has been harassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his 1975 open letter to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> accused authorities of creating `` a bureaucratic order of gray monotony that stifles all individuality.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years in jail in 1979. Authorities have banned his plays, which are widely acclaimed in productions abroad. He told the court that Charter 77 was a peaceful organization whose sole intention to ensure respect for human rights. `` For 12 years we have offered dialogue on these things, for 12 years the state power has not responded to our initiative,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. More than 100 <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> sympathizers had jammed a small stairwell leading to the courtroom, loudly cheering him earlier today when police led him to the trial. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> did not take part in a Jan. 16 flower-laying ceremony in a downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> square, but was detained on the square an hour later. The seven other defendants _ all activists with Charter 77 and other independent groups _ face hooliganism charges in connection with the Jan. 16 gathering. The charges carry a maximum two-year jail sentence. The seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlier to protest the Soviet-led invasion that quashed communist reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The arrests came during a week of protests that were the largest in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Ota </PERSON> <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON>, one of the seven Charter 77 human rights group activists being tried, said what happened on Wenceslas Square `` was not a criminal act but an assault by police.'' Most of the defendants said they came separately to the square to lay flowers in <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s memory and no demonstration was planned. More than 2,000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling for the government to release the dissidents. It was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishment intellectuals sided with opposition activists in public. The trials also have drawn an official protest from the Hungarian Writers' Union, as well as criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western governments and groups. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, and 12 other European nations agreed on new human rights accords in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have charged that the trials violate the spirit of those accords. Nine independent groups in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have appealed to all 35 states that signed the new accords to protest the trials. Those on trial are Charter 77 activists <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON> and independent activists <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Penc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Placak </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules States Cannot Exempt Religious Writings from
Sales Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that states may not give preferential treatment to religious publications by exempting them from sales taxes imposed on other books, newspapers and magazines. By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a now-defunct <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute violated the Constitution. The decision presumably will force the state to give sales tax refunds to non-religious publications or impose the levy against religious organizations that were exempt. Five justices _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> _ said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law violated the Constitution's required separation of church and state. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the law violated free-press guarantees in the Constitution by taxing non-religious publications while exempting others solely on the basis of religious content. Dissenting were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Justices </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, writing only for himself, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'s previous sales tax exemption for religious publications `` lacks a secular objective'' and `` effectively endorses religious belief.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, nothing in the Constitution's guarantee of the free exercise of religion bars states from imposing such taxes on religious periodicals. In a separate concurring opinion, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said while the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law violates the separation of church and state, some exemptions for religious publications could be constitutional. `` For example,'' said <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> in an opinion joined by <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, `` a state statute might exempt the sale not only of religious literature distributed by a religious organization but also of philosophical literature distributed by non-religious organizations devoted to such matters of conscience as life and death, good and evil, being and non-being, right and wrong.'' In a dissenting opinion joined by <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said the ruling appears to topple exemptions for religious publications granted by many other states. `` In short, religious tax exemptions of the type the court invalidates today permeate the state and federal -LRB- legal -RRB- codes and have done so for many years,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> imposed a sales tax on books and periodicals from October 1984 through October 1987. But the law exempted `` periodicals published or distributed by a religious faith and that consist wholly of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> revoked the sales tax on all books and periodicals in October 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION>, a general interest magazine with a circulation of about 280,000, challenged the exemption for religious publications after it paid more than $ 149,000 in sales taxes in 1985. The magazine is seeking a refund of the money. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 struck down an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> tax imposed on sales of general interest magazines but exempted newspapers and religious, professional, trade and sports magazines. The court in that case said states have a heavy burden of proof to justify taxing publications based on their content. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law presented a different situation: everything but religious publications had been taxed. The case acted on today is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Monthly vs. <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, 87-1245.

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Now, I'll be glad to take a couple of questions. As you know, we're leaving on this trip tomorrow and there may be some on that, which I doubt. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, what's your reaction to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threats against the British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>? And do you think that the British allies _ or that the Western allies should impose economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in retaliation? A. Well, I strongly support the EC-12 declaration in response to the Iranian threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior. And our position on terrorism is well-known. In the light of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s incitement, should any action be taken against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests, the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can expect to be held accountable. And so that is my view on it, and I think the EC-12 did the right thing. Q. How about the economic sanctions part of it? A. They will be discussing that, I'm sure, but I do n't know where we go from there. As you know, we have certain economic sanctions, and I'll be meeting in _ I know I'll be talking to President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, and I expect this subject will come up, and maybe others _ but <PERSON> Brent </PERSON>, are we in? _ I'm not sure exactly of the bilaterals we're having, but it will be a matter. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, and then we'll start moving around trying to get to the back of the room. Q. Basically, in a way, a question about your trip. There is a widespread perception that you do n't have a foreign policy, that you have permitted the Russians to move into the vacuum in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, you were surprised on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that your `` go slow'' attitude really has let the Russians grab the ball. A. Well, I've never heard such an outrageous hypothesis. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- The fact that the Soviets _ you failed to point out that the Soviets moved out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Some good things happening. I do n't worry about a trip by Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. I have no worry about that _ Q. -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- A. No, it happened just this week. And they're out of there. I do n't worry about that. And we have a foreign policy. We are reviewing appropriately East-West relations, the way we look at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But this does n't trouble me one bit. We've established and are following on with certain principles that are out there. And I think that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> when he came back made very clear that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance still looks to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'll have an opportunity to discuss a lot of things as we go on this particular trip. So I simply do n't agree with that. I really had n't ever heard such a negative approach to foreign policy. Q. -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- A. <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy? It's to encourage discussions between King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and the Israelis. And to build on the progress that has been made already. And I think it was _ I've already said that I think it was very useful, the changes that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> advocated. Now, we want to see that there's some follow-on there. So the policy is set. I campaigned on what the policy is. And I think it's quite clear. The question is, what specific steps we take next, and I do n't want to be rushing out because Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> I'd like to have for the first step we take of that nature to be a prudent step. So the principles are there, and I think we're _ you know, we've got to now flesh that out and figure out what we do specifically Yes?

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor cautioned today against taking drastic action to combat the atmosphere's greenhouse effect until scientists learn whether it causes droughts, heat waves and other climatic changes `` Our policy should be commensurate with the state of our scientific knowledge,'' Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee studying the global warming problem. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that better information is needed, but he said action was needed now as `` insurance against catastrophic change.'' The greenhouse effect `` gives you an additional reason'' to redce burning of fossil fuels and take other action to benefit the environment, the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, climate specialist said. The subcommittee was told that it may take two decades to learn whether the greenhouse effect is responsible for temperature changes like the searing heat waves of last summer. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> agreed that scientists are unable to attribute last summer's heat to the buildup of greenhouses gases, and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> showed the committee slides of news articles that he said prematurely blamed last summer's temperatures on the building up greenhouse gases. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said `` another decade, or possibly two, will be required to be sure that the warming of the 1980s -LRB- the warmest decade recorded on a global basis -RRB- will ... continue into the 1990s and beyond.'' `` I expect it will, but I ca n't prove it, of course,'' he said. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, a professor of environmental sciences, said climate experts have a `` clouded vision'' of future global warming, and told lawmakers that `` basing sweeping environmental policy'' on such uncertainties `` is especially risky, even if the policy is otherwise rational.'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> has warned in past statements against `` public hysteria'' and `` the politics of fear'' toward global warming. The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth's atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, the more heat. The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they are to outgoing infrared energy. Mars, a planet with a thin, predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a mean temperature that is below that of deep freezers. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, with a thick, largely carbon dioxide atmosphere, is hotter than an oven. The earth's atmosphere, on the other hand, has been just right to support life. It has not become an iceball because of heat trapped by greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, fluorocarbons, nitrous oxide. In addition to natural buildup, the greenhouse gases have increased dramatically because of human activities, including burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas; and destruction of tropical rain forests. The problem comes in trying to predict the future. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> denied that he's trying to `` throw roadblocks in the way of sensible environmental policy,'' and agreed global climatic change is `` potentially the most serious environmental disturbance ever created by technological man.'' But he added, `` My purpose is rather to underscore that policy should be commensurate with the state of scientific knowledge.'' Although there's no single set of figures to show how much the erth has warmed, <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said the planet `` at best, appears to have warmed up only half as much as our average forecasts indicate it should have.'' He added that the greenhouse effect may be causing a rise in nighttime temperatures only, a potentially beneficial effect that could lengthen growing seasons. And it is `` well known,'' he added, `` that long-term climate records sometimes warm because their surroundings become more urbanized.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, in proposing action now, suggested stepped-up investments in efficient energy production; accelerated testing of non-fossil fuel alternatives; development of climate-adapted crop strains; coastal planning to deal with rising sea levels and storm surges. `` Delaying rapid change can buy us time to adapt more easily and provide insurance against the not remote possibility of catastrophic rates of change,'' he said.

 Five children died when a fire raged through an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and four children died in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> row house blaze while playing with matches or a lighter, authorities said. In both fires Monday, hysterical mothers watched helplessly as flames destroyed their homes and families. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, two mothers desperately threw buckets of water on what authorities called a `` wall of fire,'' but to no avail. In the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> fire, police Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruczaj </PERSON> said he arrived at the scene to find 25-year-old <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> outside her burning apartment, holding one of her six children, a critically injured 13-month-old boy. `` My babies! My babies! They're still inside!'' Ms. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> shouted at <LOCATION> Kruczaj </LOCATION>, he recalled later. But the officer said the fire and smoke were too thick for him to attempt rescuing Ms. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>'s other five children, three boys and two girls 2 to 6 years old. All died in the blaze. The fire started Monday afternoon under a bed and officials suspect the children may have been playing with matches, fire Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliffe </PERSON> said. The official cause remains undetermined. Authorities said early reports of an explosion were erroneous. Thirty-nine of the 80 two-story units in the <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> apartment complex were damaged, authorities said. It was not known how many people were in the building at the time of the fire or how many were evacuated. Witnesses said Ms. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> was outside the apartment building talking to friends when the fire broke out. She ran inside and was able to rescue her 13-month old son, <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON>, just before <PERSON> Kruczaj </PERSON> arrived, authorities said. <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> was in critical condition today with burns over 70 percent of his body and suffering from smoke inhalation, officials said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fire broke out Monday afternoon in a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> apartment. According to <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON>, four children were playing in a bedroom and their mothers, sisters <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> and <PERSON> Devoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, were in a kitchen at the rear of the home when they smelled smoke. When they went to investigate, they found one door blocked by a mattress and another door blocked by a bunk bed, <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Devoria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> tried to put out the fire with pots and pans of water but it was to no avail. That mattress was like a wall of fire,'' <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, a neighbor, said the sight of the two hysterical mothers trying to douse the flames was enough to `` give you nightmares.'' `` By the time we got there, they were gone _ they had no chance,'' said fire Lt. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>. He said firefighters found the children, ages 4 to 8, atop one another on the lower portion of a bunk bed on the top floor of the three-story brick building. Fire Marshal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said it appeared the children had been playing with matches or a lighter. An unused smoke detector was found in a closet, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said.

 Players and spectators of a soccer match saved about 100 passengers from a sinking ferry in northeastern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, witnesses and police said Tuesday. There were no injuries. The ferry was carrying more than double its sanctioned capacity, and sank near the banks of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karala </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Mahasingh </LOCATION>, 110 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Monday, they said. Most of the 22 players of a soccer match and hundreds of spectators who heard the screams of the passengers jumped into the river, witnesses said. They rescued women and children from the hull of the sinking ferry. Almost all male passengers already had reached safety. `` The passengers could survive as the ferry sank near the bank and it took 30 minutes to sink,'' a police officer said. Ferry accidents are common in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Officials estimate 900 people have died in about 60 such accidents in the past seven years.

 Postal workers accused of traffic violations must stand trial in state courts, a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The decision limits the federal government's power to block some state prosecutions of federal workers. The justices ordered two <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> mail carriers to stand trial in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state courts. Both cases stem from traffic accidents in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In one, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> was accused of misdemeanor-manslaughter after her mail truck collided with and killed a bicyclist. In the other, <PERSON> Shabbir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON> was charged with speeding and failing to yield after his mail truck collided with a police car. Both defendants succeeded in tranferring their cases to a federal court. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 sent the cases back to the state courts. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today upheld the appeals court ruling. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, writing for the court, rejected <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> arguments that permitting state prosecutions in such cases could interfere with federal officials in performance of their duties. Only if a federal issue is directly at stake may a prosecution be shifted to federal court, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. She also noted that transferring cases like traffic violations to federal court would impose heavy burdens on local state prosecutors. `` We can discern no federal interest in potentially forcing local district attorneys to choose between prosecuting traffic violations hundreds of miles from the municipality in which the violations occurred or abandoning those prosecutions,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. A federal law providing for removal of states cases to federal court was enacted in response to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s opposition to a trade embargo declared during the War of 1812 between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Federal customs officials were given authority then to board vessels in order to collect duties, assuring they would avoid prosecution in state courts for any alleged misconduct in the performance of their duties. The 9th Circuit court had noted that in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case there was no claim by the mail carriers that their allegedly illegal conduct was justified by the duties they were performing. The case is <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 87-1206.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recalled its ambassadors from Common Market countries today, a day after the 12 European countries decided to withdraw their envoys from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be killed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its move was in direct reponse to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Monday to recall ambassadors from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and suspend high-level diplomatic exchanges. Hours later, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ which already said it would withdraw its entire embassy staff from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> _ announced it was expelling the Iranian charge d'affaires and his aide to protest the death threats. `` It is neither possible nor sensible to conduct a normal relationship with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he strongly supports <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries that have withdrawn their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In a communique, the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s week-old order for the death of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> a `` consensus judgment of all Moslem leaders throughout the world,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Many Moslems consider <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemous, although some Moslems have criticized <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be killed. The book has been banned by seven nations, including <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique as saying respect for <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> and its values will remain an inviolable principle in relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other countries. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said Monday it was withdrawing its embassy staff from the Iranian capital and closing its embassy. The two countries resumed diplomatic relations in November after a 17-month break. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, now lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and is a British citizen. The novel was first published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, although not members of the Common Market, recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> said his nation also will cancel a visit by a trade delegation scheduled for next month unless the death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is rescinded. The European Community's foreign ministers, at a meeting Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, decided to recall their country's ambassadors for consultation at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s request. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> action a `` useless maneuver certain to harm the European Community rather than <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said it was `` the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> countries which need to win <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s favor, rather than the other way around,'' the agency said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, criticized the recall as `` a big mistake'' and said it proved <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel was a plot `` designed by Western imperialism to fight true Islam,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We do not fear such threats,'' he added. `` We are prepared to follow our own path at an cost.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Moslem leaders in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> as calling for severing ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> because: `` British colonialism and the Great Satan -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- had played a basic role in insulting the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.'' The statement called <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` slanderous'' and asked the world's Moslems to carry out <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that the author be killed. Iranian clerics have put a $ 5.2 million bounty on the author's head <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is reportedly in hiding under police guard. Many Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' portrays the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggests that he _ rather than <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> _ was the source of the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book. The novel has prompted Moslem protests around the world. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, seven people died in the protests. Publishers in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have canceled plans to publish <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, and it has been pulled from bookstore shelves in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bookstores have also removed the novel from display. In a letter today to Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the more than 500 authors in the French section of the international <ORGANIZATION> Pen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> called for publication of `` The Satanic Verses.'' The authors said they were confident authorities could assure the publishers' safety. Last week, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgois </PERSON>, the French publisher with rights to the novel, said it was suspending publication to protect its employees. On Monday, Iranian leaders met at <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s home to reaffirm the `` execution'' order, and Iranian television showed the fundamentalist patriarch sitting on a balcony above a crowd of several hundred men who waved clenched fists and chanted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' and `` Long Live <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>!'' After <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s killing, Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said an apology from <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> might lead to a pardon. The 41-year-old writer apologized Saturday for any distress his book has caused Moslems. But <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rejected the apology. Neither he nor <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> made any mention of <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s statement on the issue, suggesting a split in Iranian leadership. The decision by the European countries to recall their ambassadors was a setback for Iranian moderates' hopes of improving relations with Western nations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recently has expressed interest in bolstering ties and receiving aid to help rebuilt its economy, battered by eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior,'' today backed <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries that have withdrawn their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against the government of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who has called on Muslims to send <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` to hell.'' Noting existing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said only that `` I do n't know where we'll go from there.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said American booksellers deserve the protection of the law against threats of retaliation if they display copies of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses.'' Several book dealers, including two large chains, have taken the book off the shelves. `` However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior,'' said the president. `` I've just laid down how I feel in terms of in this case the Imam exhorting people to go out and commit murder.'' At a meeting with reporters on the eve of a six-day trip to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reiterated his support for his embattled <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> and urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to `` move forthrightly'' to approve the nomination. The president said the allegations that have held up action on Tower's nomination were `` very unfair treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo.'' He said a new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, released Monday, had `` gunned down'' the allegations of misconduct. `` I saw this as a reaffirmation of what I knew all along. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is qualified to be secretary of defense,'' he added. `` Anybody that's been through this ordeal will be stronger, not weaker,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who leaves Wednesday for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was asked at one point if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had given up momentum in foreign affairs to the Soviets, whose foreign minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has been in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on a peace mission. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed off the suggestion as `` preposterous.'' Later, when asked what the Soviet role in the region ought to be, he replied, `` I think it should be a limited role, and I think that's what it's going to be.'' `` I do n't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` In my view that's a good thing.'' At a meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Monday of the 12 foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nations </ORGANIZATION>, it was decided to withdraw diplomatic representatives from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the wake of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call for the assassination of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, an Indian-born British citizen living in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding under police protection since the threat. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced today it was withdrawing its diplomats from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> nations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called reporters to the White House press room to announce that second-term Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was switching his registration from Democratic to Republican. `` This is good news for our party not only in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, not only in the South, but nationally,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s defection startled Democratic leaders. `` It took me by surprise,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I hope he's happy.'' On other topics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Sought to allay some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fears that the Japanese own too much American property. `` It is important if we believe in open markets that people be allowed to invest here just as I'd like to see more openness for American investors in other countries. ... We have to do a better job of knocking down barriers to American products'' overseas, he said. _ Said `` I'd like to find some way to do something'' about easy access to automatic weapons. But the president, a strong opponent of gun control, added that `` I want to be the president that protects the rights of people to have arms.'' _ Declared `` I'm not ruling anything in or out'' on Star Wars, the nuclear defense shield. Asked about budget aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s statement that further Star Wars development was conditional on the outcome of a 90-day review, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to close any doors or open any ... We're going to have to make some tough choices ... Let's wait and see what the review produces.'' _ Conceded that his effort to defeat former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> may have been viewed by voters as `` improper or overkill.'' But he added that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s record is `` one of racism and bigotry and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was elected as a Republican to a seat in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sharply criticized the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for `` exhorting people to go out and commit murder'' against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of `` Satanic Verses.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` however offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetraton are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized behavior.'' He warned that, `` In the light of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s incitement, should any action be taken against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests, the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can expect to be held accountable.'' He supported the European Community's unified stance against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s threats, and said he would discuss the possibility of sanctions with the president of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and other leaders in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MIDDLE EAST</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The president said the Soviets' role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` should be a limited role, and I think that's what it's going to be.'' He said he was not going to be `` stampeded'' into pressing ahead on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy simply because Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is visiting the region. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is `` to encourage discussions between King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> -LRB- of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> -RRB- and the Israelis and to build on the progress that has been made already.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TOWER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed his support for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, saying an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report had `` gunned down'' allegations of misconduct against the nominee for secretary of defense.

<BYLINE>DAVID DUKE</BYLINE>

 The president said it may have been `` improper or overkill'' for him to urge <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, voters to reject former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s bid for a seat in the state house as a Republican.

</TEXT>
<BYLINE>STAR WARS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` not ruling anything in or out'' on the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars, but the administration has `` some tough choices'' ahead on defense.

<TEXT>
 Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s final, or presumably final report on Senator Tower is now in. You are reported to have read some of it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee has it. I would like to know what you got from it, and also, whether you have any reason to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will go forward _ any reason from private conversations with members of the armed services committee _ will go forward with a favorable vote on this nomination? A. What I got from it _ and I reviewed some of the more _ the parts that related to some of the allegations against Tower _ what I got from it was that there has been a very unfair treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again _ rumors surfacing with no _ no facts to back them up. And I saw this as a reaffirmation of what I've felt all along, and that is that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is qualified to be secretary of defense; he will be a good secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, although the report did n't answer that But the allegations against him that have been hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of fact. And so that's positive. And I had a little preview, so when I held my thumbs up, I was glad to get that report. And I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will move forthrightly on this nomination. So _ and I do n't know, Brit, what _ where it stands. I talked to _ I had some of the leaders down this morning, but the only one I got to talk to on this was <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. And I'd like to see it go forward, obviously. Q. If I might follow _ A. I have never wavered in my support for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. Q. If I could follow up, sir. There's a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning that Senator Tower promoted a federal judgeship for the son of a man with whom he had done business for his own personal benefit. And I was wondering if that's news to you, sir, and if _ or if it troubles you in any way? A. I never heard such a report, and I'd _ you know, one thing after another. And, you're telling me something I do n't know anything about. Yes? Q. Mr. President, does this announcement by Congressman <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> this morning overcome the embarrassment to the party of the election Saturday of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>? And do you intend to _ you came out for his opponent in the election; so did former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. What does the party do next about <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>? A. Well, I'll leave that to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. But I strongly support what our national Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has said in this matter. And maybe there was some feeling in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, that the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> involving himself in a state legislative election was improper or overkill. I've heard _ read that. And I ca n't deny that. But what I can affirm is, I did what I did because of principle and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has done what he has done because of principle and this man, his record is one of racism and bigotry, and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out. But whether it helped or hurt, I do n't know. Q. Mr. President, you said during your speech to the joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that your support for the Strategic Defense Initiative was unqualified, but the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, when he briefed on your budget, said that it was conditional on the outcome of this 90-day review that's coming up Is it or is it not conditional and would you rule out curtailing the program to an accidental launch protection system? A. I'm not ruling anything in or out. I have stated my support for the principle of SDI. I have not favored what some would call `` premature deployment'' but on the other hand I will be very interested in seeing what this overall review comes up with and I'm not going to close any doors or open any in regards to this or any other systems. We're going to have to make some tough choices on defense. I'm aware of that and so let's wait and see what the review produces. <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, back on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, if we could. You've said that the process has been unfair and I would like to ask you specifically about <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who some people say will now run defense policy because <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has been so weakened and damaged by this drip, drip, drip of allegations.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` placed himself above the law'' by lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and shredding documents to conceal his support of the Nicaraguan rebels, a prosecutor told jurors today at the opening of the former presidential aide's Iran-Contra trial. Associate independent counsel <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lies to congressional committees and to the attorney general amount to `` a crime that goes to the soul of our self-government.'' But <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, countered that `` the defense says to you, he is not guilty on all charges. He never broke the law ... he followed instructions of higher authority.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, delivered their opening statements, each describing a different North, the first person to go on trial in the Iran-Contra affair. `` He was doing his job as he understood it; he was doing his duty as he understood it,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` If he did n't, then there could be death resulting to the people he worked with and dangers resulting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The need for secrecy is no excuse for lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the jury. `` Lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a crime.'' `` You do n't have to be a political scientist to understand why that's so,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts the law, the president approves it and enforces it. If they start lying to eachother our system of government is not going to work.'' A year after it passed the 1984 Boland Amendment banning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> received news reports that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, then a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, was secretly raising money for the rebels from foreign countries and private donors and providing tactical military advice. North and his boss at the time, national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, `` decided they did n't want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to know what Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> had been doing. They decided they would not tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. `` They decided they would place themselves above the law and not tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities.'' Similar inquiries a year later were met with false answers from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, including a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide `` looked them right in the eye and he lied,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> North </PERSON> pocketed some of the travelers checks a <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader gave to him to cover expenses incurred helping the rebels. `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> used that $ 4,000 like it was his personal piggy bank'' to buy groceries, tires and take his family on a trip,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. North also accepted installation of a security fence around his <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, house from arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who had helped sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and divert $ 15 million in profits to buy weapons for the Contras, the prosecutor said. The arms-for-hostages deals with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were kept secret from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until October 1986, when `` the roof caved in on this house of cards'' with public disclosures about the Iran-Contra affair, he said. When <PERSON> North </PERSON> went to his office on Nov. 21, 1986, `` the first thing he did was take some of the records and change them to make it look like what he had been doing he had n't been doing for the last two years,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. `` He wanted to hide that he had already twice lied to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said, and also wanted to hide that he and others `` had diverted money from the Iranian arms sales to help the Contras.'' `` He went into his office and began to change the records, shred the records, destroy the records,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told jurors. Two days later, when he lied to then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, `` he had placed himself above the law again.'' North sat raptly at attention as <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> spoke, occasionally taking notes. North's wife, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>, was escorted to her seat in the packed courtroom by security guards midway through <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s opening statement. Some 100 lawyers, reporters and members of the public began lining up outside the courtroom for opening arguments in the long-awaited trial. The crush of spectators prompted court officials to announce that only 15 seats would be set aside for the public, including some aides to independant counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> who were hoping to observe the proceedings from the audience. The defense contends that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was personally involved in offering inducements to third countries to support the Contras opposing the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a handful of top administration officials then directed a cover-up of the arrangement. If <PERSON> North </PERSON> hid the arrangement from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> suggested in court filings last week, it was because he was directed to do so by the president and his aides. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has spent much of the 11 months since <PERSON> North </PERSON> was indicted wrestling with problems stemming from balancing the use of classified material against <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s right to a fair defense. National security concerns by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration led to the dropping of the two central charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The trial was delayed last week due to fears by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be allowed to spill out in the courtroom a mass of classified material damaging to the national security. In a tartly worded opinion issued in December, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> accused the defense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitive classified information to scuttle the case. The judge rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request for more stringent controls over state secrets that <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to present in his defense. The next day, as a jury was being chosen, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> launched efforts to get the trial delayed, setting off a complex fight with independent counsel <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who wanted the case to go forward immediately. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> got the assurances he was seeking last Wednesday and a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> stay that had delayed the trial was lifted. Through it all, the jury selected in the case waited to be called by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. The nine women and three men jurors chosen Feb. 9 have one thing in common: They had almost no exposure to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s nationally televised congressional testimony in 1987 in which he admitted, under limited immunity from prosecution, many details touching on the events that led to the criminal charges against him. The jurors include an electronics technician, a cashier, a clerk typist at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a clerical worker who says `` I do n't like the news'' and an unemployed former office manager who says she recalled that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was `` selling something to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North faces 12 criminal charges. Indicted last March, he is the first figure in the Iran-Contra affair to come to trial. He could face up to 60 years in prison and $ 3 million in fines if convicted on all counts. Former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms supplier <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> also face criminal charges in the case, but, along with <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, are to be tried separately later. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed two central charges against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> on Jan. 13 _ conspiracy and theft counts that accused North of diverting more than $ 14 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies feared damage to national security and as a result <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> asked to have those two counts thrown out.

 A. I think <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> would be the first to deny that. I think he's been fair and have so stated before. The rumors _ and he's not been promulgating a lot of endless rumors that have proved to have no basis in fact. None.

Is Senator Tower damaged in his ability to speak out for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> now that _ A. No. Q. _ he has had such a lengthy process? A. No. Anybody that's been through this ordeal with be stronger not weaker. Yes? Q. But Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> is concerned about these reports of Senator Tower's drinking problems and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report acknowledges that the senator apparently did have a drinking problem in the 1970s. Do you think he's overly concerned and why are you so convinced that this wo n't present a problem? A. Because I know Senator Tower. I have talked to a lot of people that have worked with Senator Tower. I've seen the report on Senator Tower and I see nothing in there that would make me, if I were a senator, vote against Senator Tower. Now, Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, he's got to reach his own conclusions, and I think he's been fair. And I think he is approaching it in a very professional manner. But I hope he reaches the same conclusion that I have reached. Yeah, in the back? Q. Mr. President, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and other big cities have been besieged with violence lately. Do you see any role at all that the federal government can play to help in that area?

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Tougher Pension Plan Reviews</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today told federal judges to be tougher in second-guessing decisions by pension and welfare plans that deny benefits to workers. In ruling unanimously in a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the justices said federal judges must evaluate such cases just as if the pension and welfare plan officials had not yet made any decision. Some federal courts instead have been employing a less stringent standard of review _ generally not disturbing decisions by plan officials unless they are found to be `` arbitrary or capricious.'' The dispute ruled on today stemmed from Firestone's selling its plastics division in 1980 to <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The sale affected some 500 workers at Firestone plants in <LOCATION> Pottstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caldwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Perryville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, Md.; and <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Nearly all the workers were given the opportunity to keep their jobs under the new ownership, and most accepted. Some workers sought certain benefits from <LOCATION> Firestone </LOCATION>, including early retirement and severance pay, that were included in the three Firestone welfare and pension plans. The company denied the benefits. It also refused to release information about the benefit plans to workers who sought it, on grounds that the workers no longer were employed by <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> and no longer participants in the plans. The workers sued, charging Firestone with violating the federal Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974 -LRB- ERISA -RRB-. A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. But the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the suit. The appeals court said workers' claims must be examined more closely in such cases. Writing for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the appeals court was right. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the more stringent standard of judicial review should apply unless the plan gives its administrator or other officials `` the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.'' The justices told the 3rd Circuit court to restudy the issue of whether the workers seeking information about the welfare and pension plans from Firestone qualify as `` participants'' who are entitled under ERISA to such information. The case is Firestone vs. <PERSON> Bruch </PERSON>, 87-1054.

 Local officials welcomed a plan taking effect today to arrest unqualified applicants for political asylum, but advocates for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants criticized it as `` mean-spirited.'' While more than 100 immigrants lined up today to apply for political asylum, six people, including three nuns, began a fast outside the detention facility in protest of the new Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy. `` We do n't plan to finish this fast until we have a specific answer'' from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaya </PERSON>, a Salvadoran resident-alien. <PERSON> Amaya </PERSON> said the group was demanding refugee status for Salvadoran aliens and an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to their country. Their protest was in front of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a 315-acre detention facility 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> where asylum applications are taken. On Monday, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office here, said the federal agency will speed up its processing of asylum applications and take a tough line on `` frivolous'' claims. For months, local elected officials have called on the federal government to relieve the burden placed on their communities by homeless Central Americans. `` From the standpoint of the city, I think it will be good in terms of taking people and providing for them in a humanitarian way,'' said <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, whose city is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' southernmost The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> plan, which will take several weeks to phase in, will bring more than 500 federal workers to the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area. The agency will add 269 people to its 375-member Border Patrol between <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, a stretch of more than 300 miles. It also will increase its staff of asylum adjudicators in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> from 16 to 74. Immigrants who apply for asylum but do n't qualify will be placed in detention centers. If necessary, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will build a tent city capable of holding up to 5,000 detainees, officials said. <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, whose city on Feb. 10 evicted the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> from its asylum-processing office over alleged health and safety violations, described the plan as a `` good initial first step.'' But advocates for the immigrants decried the plan. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> immigration attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanez </PERSON> said a lengthy appeals process, a shortage of qualified attorneys and clogged immigration court dockets will mean lengthy detention for many under the new procedure. `` I think we're going to see detention -LRB- for -RRB- years,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Yanez </PERSON>. A group called the <ORGANIZATION> Brownsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> criticized the new policy as a `` mean-spirited attempt to deter political refugees from applying for political asylum.'' Several local churches helped provide bus tickets for Central Americans who had until midnight Monday to leave the area legally, said <ORGANIZATION> Mervin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosbacker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit interdenominational relief group. Since Jan. 9, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has been prohibited by a court order from restricting the travel of asylum seekers, many of whom go to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The restraining order expired today. The adjudication and detention plan announced Monday could not have been implemented had the order been in place. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he hoped the plan would slow the wave of immigration he said threatened to `` empty out'' <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We think people -LRB- will -RRB- realize in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that it's not worth spending your life savings to pay a smuggler to get you into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because you will not get to stay and work here if you do not have a legal basis to come,'' he said. Those denied under the new plan will be placed in deportation proceedings, held in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> custody and will appear before immigration judges, where they may resubmit asylum cases. Previously, Central Americans who were denied asylum were given 30 days to leave the country. Single adults will be held in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention centers, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will put family groups and unaccompanied minors under less restrictive custody in shelters operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, where they must report for daily roll calls Detention facilities listed in the plan include 1,100 beds at the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 200 in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and 200 in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said a tent camp might be built for up to 5,000 people at the Port Isabel center if the population continues to accumulate. At the current rate, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 100,000 Central Americans this year would pass through the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area, the main entry point for asylum seekers from that region. In the recent past, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has provided political asylum to Nicaraguans in particular, but the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> maintains that most Central American immigrants do not qualify because they are seeking better economic conditions rather than fleeing political persecution.

 Three people, including one connected with a neo-fascist terrorist group, were arrested with explosives they apparently planned to use in a jail break, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamponi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luca </PERSON> <PERSON> Onesti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Casu </PERSON> were arrested Saturday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and charged with criminal association and possession and transport of explosives, police told a news conference. `` A breakout of notable importance has been avoided,'' said Col. <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leopizzi </PERSON>. `` These arrests are the result of four months of anti-terrorist surveillance.'' Police arrested <PERSON> Tamponi </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Casu </PERSON>, 27, as they were on their way to Rebibbia prison, on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s outskirts, where <PERSON> Tamponi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>, is serving a life sentence for armed robbery and double homicide Police believe the group planned to use the explosives to free criminals with right-wing sympathies from Rebibbia. They found nearly one pound of explosive in powder form, six detonators and 16 feet of slow-burning fuses. <LOCATION> Onesti </LOCATION>, 33, was arrested in 1981, during <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s strict anti-terrorism laws, for suspected links to the right-wing Armed Revolutionary Nucleus terror group. He finally was released without charge in 1985.

<HEAD>Child-Molesting Teacher Surprised He Got Away With It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convicted child molester who taught at a Cherokee Indian school for 14 years said today in videotaped testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was surprised he was able to continue the illicit activity for so long. `` This is strictly hindsight. Looking back, it certainly is a phenomenon that's hard to understand,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who is serving a 10-year sentence in <ORGANIZATION> Butner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Price pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation. But in the tape he admitted for the first time that he had abused at least 25 boys while he taught at the Cherokee school in western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Under questioning by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellen </PERSON>, counsel to a special investigative unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, Price said no one ever tried to stop him even though he believed that they knew of his sexual activity with the boys. Price's testimony came as the committee began its third week of hearings into corruption of various kinds on the nation's Indian reservations. A former supervisor of Price testified that he was instrumental in having Price removed from his division as a seventh-grade teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s campus lab school in 1971. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, then director of the lab school, had a son who was in the seventh grade at the school when Price taught there. Justice said that his son told him of cases of sexual molestation by Price with other seventh-graders on an overnight camping trip. Justice said he told the school superintendent about the incident and the superintendent waited until the end of the year to dismiss Price. Justice said that when he found out that Price was teaching at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> school on the Cherokee reservation he wrote a letter to the school principal and warned him about Price. However, Price was not dismissed until 14 years later. Justice said that while all 50 states have child abuse-reporting laws the federal government does not. In 1974, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required states to enact such laws as a requirement for receiving federal aid. Justice, who has had experience in enforcing these laws, said `` even a suspicion'' of child abuse must be reported and a follow-up investigation must be conducted within 24 hours. `` I strongly believe there needs to be some federal legislation,'' he said. He said there is no federal law to stop Price from going to another Indian school and committing the same crime again. At the close of his testimony, Price said: `` I've had time, of course, in prison to reflect over this and the seriousness of it. Fondling is, you know, in my mind, I was thinking, it really does n't hurt anybody. But I know now how much it does hurt. We just must find a way to help the children first _ and of course the molesters also _ above all, the children, who really do n't know what they're getting into.''

 A. Well, I hope so. But certainly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> we have a responsibility, it's a federal city, and a lot of the funds come _ obviously come from the federal government. But, there is n't any easy answer to that, and yet I, you know, campaigned strongly on enforcing existing law, on being tough on criminals, on more prison space. And I think that those things all will be caught up in our new anti-drug effort that I'm looking to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to lead. And so it's a complicated problem where everybody in the country has a stake in it. Everybody should be trying to do something about it. And yes, I think the federal government has a role in that. Q. If I may follow. Is there any federal money for it? Is this something that you really do not have the resources to attack? A. Yes, there will be federal money and I wish we had more. Yeah, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. Q. Mr. President! Q. Mr. President _ A. How far do we go to be democratic, here? No that's too far _ here. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Q. Mr. President, you said in answer to <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s question that you wanted your first step in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to be prudent. What do you mean by a prudent step? What do you have in mind? A. What I have in mind is I do n't want to just send somebody charging off on a mission to counter Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s trip to see <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and others. Let's do something that's going to hopefully have results. And I'm not saying we have to know that a trip by the secretary, or a trip by _ instructions to an ambassador are going to result in a settled policy _ everything's settled in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But, I do n't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. So it's _ in my view, that's a good thing. Q. What role do you think Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and the Soviets could and should be playing? A. I think it should be a limited role, and I think that's what it's going to be. Q. Mr. President _ A. And that's exactly the way it should be and I think the people in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> feel that way. But the fact that he goes there really should n't be bad. Yes? Q. Mr. President, if the West Germans _ A. Viewed with alarm. Q. _ if the West Germans refuse to modernize short-range weapons, will that hurt the alliance in the long run and perhaps result in the denuclearization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ A.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday the federal government has a responsibility to help curb an increase in drug-related homicides in the nation's capital. `` We have a responsibility as a federal city ... but there is n't any easy answer to that,'' he said in answer to a question at a news conference `` I campaigned strongly on enforcing existing law, on being tough on criminals, on more prison space. I think all those things will be caught up in our new anti-drug program. ... Yes, I think the federal government has a role in it.'' He said, `` There will be federal money and I wish we had more,'' but he did not elaborate. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has recorded 80 homicides so far this year, compared with 51 by Feb. 21 a year ago The city's 372 homicides last year set a record for the city. About 80 percent of the deaths were drug-related, according to a study released last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said last week he was worried about the proliferation and use of firearms in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and elsewhere but still wanted to be a president who `` protected the rights of people to have arms.'' He said that states should enforce existing laws and that he would strongly oppose any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic weapons.. `` It's hard, very hard to do, but that's my position and I'm not going to change it,'' he said in an interview with several reporters last Wednesday. `` Look at the laws on gun control, and you'll find where some of the more stringent gun control laws exist that weapons are procured there and weapons are used there. So, you're not going to get me to do anything other than to say I'm very concerned about this.'' The district has one of the nation's toughest gun laws. Dozens of states, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, are considering measures to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of semiautomatic weapons.

 Representatives of 16 countries arrived Tuesday for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, and concern for the safety of visiting world leaders grew with the discovery of two homemade projectiles near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s airport. The projectiles were in launchers aimed at the heavily guarded airport, about 40 miles east of the city, and apparently were planted by radicals opposed to Friday's state funeral, a police official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a timer also was found. He declined to say at what time it was set. Cargo traffic and flights through <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s domestic airport will be restricted this week, and 32,000 police have been mobilized in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Officers were stationed at checkpoints throughout the city and patrolled downtown neighborhoods. They also have searched homes along the funeral route. Authorities say the massive police presence is justified by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s small but active radical groups and by fears that international terrorists could attack as visiting leader. Officials say representatives of 163 countries will attend the funeral. Workers on Tuesday made final preparations at the funeral site in a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> park. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, and Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> met briefly with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and his wife, Tellervo, at the Akasaka Palace. It was the royal couple's first meeting with foreign dignitaries since <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died Jan. 7. They are expected to meet other heads of state and visiting royalty during the week. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is to meet with about 40 of the 55 heads of state who plan to attend the funeral, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> will meet about 90 foreign officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says. Many of those talks will last less than half an hour, but <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> plans longer meetings with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The diplomatic contacts began Tuesday with a meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Takakazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuriyama </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>. They discussed plans for talks in March on a peace treaty to formally end World War II hostilities and settle a long-standing territorial dispute involving Soviet-held islands, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Foreign officials also will meet among themselves. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> has scheduled talks with Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> to discuss <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s return to Chinese control. Many Japanese proudly see the large number of countries attending as a sign that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> finally has been accepted internationally after its disastrous role in World War II. But there were reminders of lingering ill feelings. In several nations, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, there were disputes over who to send to the funeral because of memories of the war, fought in <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s name. Japanese who oppose the state funeral, including radicals, say <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> led <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> into World War II and failed to stop the oppressive actions of the militarist government of the time. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adjourned Monday until after the funeral, giving <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> a respite from criticism at home over an embarrassing stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken his governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Three Cabinet members have resigned in connection with the scandal.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s journey to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will take him inexorably down a path of war memories punctuated by visions of being shot down at sea and losing two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buddies in combat. But if attending Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral on Friday presents a painful reminder of the war with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't saying so. `` I'm doing what's right,'' he said recently. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviator whose plane was shot down over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> by the Japanese in 1944, said, `` We have a good relationship with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. I want to see it even better. And this does n't concern me a bit. And you're talking to a person who was in combat in World War II. I feel you look ahead, not always look back. You do what's right `` It's the right thing to do.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> twice as vice president, in 1982 and 1984. In his 1987 autobiography, `` Looking Forward,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shows little reluctance to talk about what happened Sept. 2, 1944. The young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer and two other crew members _ gunnery officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Ted </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and radioman-tailgunner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> _ had taken off in a TBM Avenger on a mission to knock out a Japanese radio facility on <LOCATION> Chichi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jima </LOCATION>, one of three islands in the <PERSON> Bonin </PERSON> chain about 600 miles from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described in graphic detail how his plane was blown from the sky and how he managed to ride a torn parachute to the water, ultimately to be picked up by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescue ship, the USS Finback. As he neared the water, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote, `` I looked around for <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> White </PERSON>, but the only thing in sight was my parachute drfiting away.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote about the letter he sent his parents six days after his rescue, in which he `` described my feelings at the time.'' `` I try to think about it as little as possible,'' he wrote in the book. `` Yet, I can not get those two out of my mind. ... I know I wo n't be able to shake the memory of this incident and I do n't believe I want to completely. Two days before his inauguration Jan. 20, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was reunited with about three dozen of his war buddies, hosting a nostaligic party for surviving fellow pilots, radiomen and gunners and sharing remembrances with them. In a recent telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>, the submarine torpedoman who helped pull <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from his bobbing life raft, said, `` I think he feels the need to go there for the total relationship between their country and our country. They're a major entity in the world economy.'' <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>, who is 64, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he shares the president's view that `` you should forgive and forget. ... I do n't know what part <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had in running the country into war, but, believe me, I think most people in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today want to forget about the war.'' <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> added, `` I know there are other people'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` who have strong feelings the other way.'' Former Sen. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., who was a North Vietnamese prisoner of war for eight years, described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a giant of a man'' who wants to avoid showing any feeling of vindictiveness toward the Japanese <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is traveling to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with an interest in `` the commonality of humankind'' and `` with altruism toward his fellow man,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` He seems to understand the Japanese people and the Japanese people understand him,'' said <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said that while he has not returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he believes that Americans caught in wars seldom hold lingering bitterness toward the people of a nation that has warred against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I feel very lovingly frustrated toward the people of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he said. A presidential scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is in the noblesse oblige tradition and part of noblesse oblige is sublimating oneself to the common good.'' `` My personal feeling is that if he does have lingering bitterness; he's suppressed it,'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said. `` He's going to be busy having meetings with world leaders. He really wo n't have that much time to concentrate on the personal aspect of it. He'll be so busy that I do n't think he'll have much time for personal reflection.''

 Q. Mr. President, I'll ask you a <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> question _ A. Shoot. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q. _ with the summit starting tomorrow. How do you reasssure those Americans who are afraid of Japanese economic power, who think that they are buying and are owning too much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy? A. I tell them that the Japanese have the _ are the third largest holder of investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, behind the <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. I tell them that it is important, if we believe in open markets, that people be allowed to invest here, just as I'd like to see more openness for American investors in other countries. I tell them that we have to do a better job in knocking down barriers to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products in the various markets. I tell them, do n't get so concerned over foreign ownership that you undermine the securities markets in this country. We have horrendous deficits, and foreign capital joins domestic capital in financing those deficits. So I also tell them I have a responsibility as president in terms of our technology, in terms of our national security, and I intend to exercise that responsibility. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>? Q. Yes, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I think what concerns some people about Senator Tower is the fact that he has admitted that he had a drinking problem in the'70s, and he has n't really had any kind of treatment program or been enrolled in any kind of treatment program. What do you say to people about the potential of a relapse? A. I say that he _ that there is no evidence of any kind of the disease alcoholism _ none, none whatsoever. And that would be something that would be _ that your question is addressed to. And I'd say that I looked at the reports with this in mind, and I did n't listen to rumors. I did n't listen to mindless allegations. I was fair enough to look at the facts. And I've known Senator Tower, and known him professionally, and known him as a friend. And I do not think that these charges that are tried and then shot down, and then tried again and then shot down again, have helped the process. And so I am not about to make a judgment on some rumor or some innuendo. And we've looked at the facts. And I think the report speaks to the fact that a lot of the charges _ most _ oh, I'd say all of these charges that we've read about _ have been rumor, and a lot of it vicious rumor. And so I am convinced that he is not only capable of doing this job, but will do it in an outstanding way. Q. Mr. President _ A. How many more have we got? Q. On the budget _ A. Who is that voice I hear in the back? Could it be <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>? Q. No! A. Well, sorry. It's a democracy.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Limits Damages in Georgia Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case involving alleged fraud in a 20-year-old business merger, today limited the ability of people to seek additional damages after winning a lawsuit. The 9-0 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> restricts the ability of purported fraud victims to sue a leading accounting firm. The case arose out of the 1969 merger of <ORGANIZATION> Cavalier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and E.T. <ORGANIZATION> Barwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The owners of Cavalier Bag _ <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy-Kenneth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterneck </PERSON> _ charged in a 1975 lawsuit that the financial health of <ORGANIZATION> Barwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> was overstated. The Osternecks sued <ORGANIZATION> Barwick </ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION>, an accounting firm that had prepared the allegedly inflated financial statements. After nearly 10 years of pre-trial maneuvering, the case went to trial in 1984 and the <LOCATION> Barwick </LOCATION> company and its offficials were ordered to pay the Osternecks more than $ 2.6 million in damages plus $ 946,000 in interest. But the <PERSON> Osternecks </PERSON> lost their case against <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whinney </LOCATION>. They then appealed, seeking to revive the case against the accounting firm. That appeal was filed at the same time that the Osternecks' request for interest payments against the <ORGANIZATION> Barwick </ORGANIZATION> officials was pending in court. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the Osternecks' bid for damages against the accounting firm must be treated as a motion to amend the original judgment that the <PERSON> Osternecks </PERSON> had won Therefore, the appeals court barred the Osternecks from pursuing a separate appeal against <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whinney while at the same time they were seeking additional interest payments against the <ORGANIZATION> Barwick </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today upheld the appeals court ruling. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, writing for the court, said handling appeals in this manner helps avoid piecemeal appellate court review of lower court judgments. The case is Osterneck vs. <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whinney </LOCATION>. 87-1201.

<HEAD>Court Gives Lawyers Extra Fee in Louisiana Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today gave lawyers added incentive _ the possibility of bigger-than-bargained-for legal fees _ to represent those who claim their civil rights were violated. The court ruled in a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> case that the losing side in some civil rights lawsuits may be forced to pay the winning side's lawyers more than the lawyers originally had sought The normal rule in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts is that each side pays its own lawyers. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has altered that rule in about 200 fee-shifting laws, and allowed the winning side to collect its lawyer fees from the losing side. Most notably, such fee awards are available to people who successfully sue over civil rights violations. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who said he was assaulted without provocation by a <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> sheriff's deputy, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, was awarded $ 10,000 in damages by a federal jury. The presiding judge also awarded <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> $ 7,500 in lawyer fees, which <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON> was ordered to pay. But the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reduced the lawyer-fee award to $ 4,000 after noting that <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> and his lawyer had a contingency-fee agreement in which the lawyer was to get 40 percent of any damage award. The appeals court said the 40 percent contingency agreement effectively placed a cap on any lawyer-fee award that could be made. Writing for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said no such cap exists. `` If a contingent fee agreement were to govern as a strict limitation on the award of attorney's fees, an undesirable emphasis might be placed on the importance of the recovery of damages in civil rights litigation,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` The intention of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, `` was to encourage successful civil rights litigation, not to create a special incentive to prove damages and shortchange efforts to seek effective injunctive or declaratory relief.'' The justices told the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its lawyer-fee award ruling in <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s case. The case is <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, 87-1485.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with congressional leaders today in an effort to propel budget talks forward, but a top House budget writer said details on `` tough choices'' were still missing. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the hour-long breakfast session at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> dealt more with process than with details of the $ 1.16 trillion spending plan `` It was important for us to emphasize we're on the right track. And we are,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. But, he added. `` When does he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- start to make the tough choices? That's part of the process here, to find out what the choices are.'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the meeting `` was not a discussion about details'' but an effort `` to discuss how we might proceed in the future, to discuss the process. The session included <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders from both houses as well as heads of the congressional budget, appropriations and tax-writing committees. Seated at the center of one side of the long rectangular table in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, the president refused to answer reporters' questions during a brief photo-taking session <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to be an active player in shaping spending cuts needed to get the government's annual budget deficit under the $ 100 billion required by law for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> faces an April 15 deadline for completion of its version of the budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s participation in the budget-writing process is unusual in that it comes less than two weeks after he submitted his proposed $ 1.16 trillion spending plan, before any votes on spending decisions have been held by committees in either chamber. `` It's a ratcheting-up of the process,'' presidential Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in advance of today's meeting. `` Its purpose is to keep the momentum going,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, noting that it was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first meeting with congressional leaders since the president's address to a joint House-Senate session nearly two weeks ago. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes discussions will continue during his absence, but that talk has not yet reached the negotiating stage. `` I'd say it's in the consultation and discussion stage,'' he said. White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, meanwhile, opened two days of testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget committees with a defense of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spending plan as realistic. Leaving the details of spending cuts for future negotiations was acknowledging where those decisions would be made, he said. But Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said they saw it as a political ploy. `` I just do n't see this as a serious initiative,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION> `` Where are the cuts going to come from?'' said committee chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn. `` We just do n't know from looking at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Democrats say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> listed politically popular initiatives on child care, education, and homelessness but did not list the approximately $ 10 billion in cuts that must be made in other programs to pay for the increases _ leaving those unpopular choices to share with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> counters that `` some 800 pages of details'' have been made available to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in addition to the 193-page budget document that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> submitted on Feb. 9. `` They contain a number of policy options,'' he said, `` but not necessarily specific cuts. ... A number of various options.'' When pressed Monday to say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had recommended budget reductions in specific areas, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` cuts that the group might consider.'' Indeed, papers obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> show the administration avoided in those documents putting its stamp on any particular set of cuts. Options listed included adoption of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget choices, or freezing programs at last year's levels without allowing for inflation. Blank spaces were left for final decisions, presumably to be worked out in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The documents also suggest that the definition of a `` flexible freeze'' is itself flexible and still being developed. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget released Feb. 9 defined the freeze as a package of $ 136 billion in domestic programs held at this year's spending levels, without inflation. Some of those could be increased, but only if others were decreased to keep the total the same. The papers sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week showed the $ 136 billion included a small piece of the defense budget, about $ 6 billion, earmarked for programs such as atomic research. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made three out-of-town speeches on his fiscal 1990 budget proposal last week, capping the appearances with a declaration in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> last Friday that he wanted `` a quick and early resolution to the budget crisis.'' `` I am committed to working closely with my friends on the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> to help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law for an April 15 budget resolution,'' he said. That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for a deficit in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 of no more than $ 100 billion _ down from an estimated $ 160 billion this year. Failure by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to meet that target could result in automatic across-the-board cuts. In the proposal he submitted, which was intended to amend the fiscal 1990 budget offered by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to increase spending in a number of social areas. But Democrats have been pushing him to spell out where he would make $ 10 billion to $ 11 billion in necessary cuts to pay for the emphasis he wants to give certain programs, especially in view of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-tax-increase pledge. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> suggested Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will have their own agenda. Talking to reporters covering the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> executive council meeting in <LOCATION> Bal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, for example, that it was his intention to schedule early floor debate on legislation to increase the minimum wage, which has been frozen at $ 3.35 an hour since 1981. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the Democrats' bill would not contain a sub-minimum youth training wage that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed. But the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat said it was possible the bill would be amended on the floor.

 Q. I want to ask you about gun control. All over the country _ A. Who? Q. _ the parents and the people _ Now, do n't leave me! Do n't leave me -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> _ Q. All over the country the parents now are going to city hall about this. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> they just had a vote, the polls are being taken, mothers are up in arms about this. Something is going to have to be done about stopping guns and you say you're for them. A. For what? Q. That's what you said the other day, that you were not going to stop _ be for the ban on gun control. A. I'd like to find some way to do something about these automated weapons. I'd like to see some way to enforce the laws that are already in the books about automated AK-47s coming into this country. And I'd like to find a way to be supportive of the police who are out there on the line all the time, and maybe there is some answer to it. But I also want to have _ be the president that protects the rights of people to have arms. And that _ Q. -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- A. _ so you do n't go so far that the legitimate rights on some legislation are, you know, impinged on. Q. Sir, that's what we said last year, but now _ <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, look at the laws on gun control and you find where some of the most stringent gun control laws exist that weapons are procured there and weapons are used there. So, you're not going to get me to do anything other than to say, `` Look, I'm very concerned about this. I'd like to find a way to do something about this, and we're going to take a hard look to see what we can do about it, if anything, that would be helpful.'' But whenever there is a crime involving a firearm, there are various groups, some of them quite persuasive in their logic, that think you can ban certain kinds of guns, and I am not in the mode. I am in the mode of being deeply concerned and would like to be a part of finding a national answer to this problem. Now, we've got time for one more. Right in the middle. You can fight about it. -LRB- Laughs. -RRB- Q. Speaking of rights, I want to ask if it disturbs you at all the American booksellers were forced to take Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book _ intimidated into taking Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book off the shelves and if you'd given any thought to some sort of federal protection to help them defend the _ A. The answer is yes, and federal protection would be to enforce the laws that exist against people doing violence, and of course, I'm concerned about that. Who would n't be? <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> gets the follow-up and them I'm leaving. Q. Budget question _ A. I know there's an overwhelming _ <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> has got the last question, and I get the last word. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB-

 <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a 20-year women's world wrestling champion who attributed her success to her muscular build and her alligator clutch hold, has died at age 73 after a stroke. Ms. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who was 5-foot-2, 138 pounds in her wrestling prime, had such a well-muscled build that the Police Department once displayed her poster in its offices to shame its officers into staying in shape. She died Saturday at <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. She suffered a stroke Feb. 14. Ms. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, wrestling champion from 1936 to 1956, claimed to have invented the alligator clutch, a pinning maneuver in which the wrestler twists his opponent into something resembling a pretzel and then sits on him. `` She was totally feminine,'' said her son, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` More than anything else, she stressed being very feminine and a loving mother.'' She claimed to have won more than 150 matches against men and more than 5,000 against women. She claimed to have never lost. `` I've had two or three girls say they beat me and I've threatened to take them to court because they never even wrestled me,'' she said in 1981 Born in <LOCATION> Coffeyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> started wrestling in 1935 on the carnival circuit. She offered $ 25 to any man of similar weight who could pin her within 10 minutes. It was reported that no one ever did.

<HEAD>Judge Increases Damages In 1978 French Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge today recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> be ordered to pay about $ 115 million to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and nearly 90 French citizens or businesses damaged by millions of gallons of oil spilled in a 1978 supertanker accident. Retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarr </PERSON>, sitting as a special master, recommended an increase of about $ 30 million in his original $ 85.2 million judgment against the oil company. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON> will enter a final judgment. Virtually all parties to the case had asked <PERSON> McGarr </PERSON> to reconsider his January 1988 decision, issued before his retirement as a federal judge. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> and the French plaintiffs immediately indicated they were likely to appeal today's ruling. `` A lot of people wo n't be happy. The recommendation is a mixed bag. But the oyster growers, for one, will be pleased. They're in line for the biggest revision,'' said attorney <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Marwedel </PERSON>, who represented a number of oyster syndicates, two French regions and a number of other plaintiffs affected by the spill from the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION> supertanker. `` It's a very conservative, traditional opinion,'' <PERSON> Marwedel </PERSON> said. `` Things like the loss of enjoyment and environmental claims were not given the consideration we had sought.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> said the company was pleased with <PERSON> McGarr </PERSON>'s recommendation. ` If you look at the total awarded so far, they've only got about 3 percent of what they originally claimed,'' <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> said. `` The judge indicated again he thought they were overreaching and there were some duplicate claims.'' <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> is proceeding with litigation against the Spanish builder of the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Astilleros </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espanoles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION> ran aground two miles off the <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION> coast March 16, 1978. The huge tanker, which had lost the use of its rudder, had been under tow through the English Channel by a German-owned tug when the towlines snapped in hurricane-force winds and heavy seas. The Liberian-registered supertanker carried 223,000 tons, or 68 million gallons, of mostly Iranian light crude oil valued at $ 24 million. The spill, the largest ever from a tanker, caused an oil slick more than 10 miles across and 80 miles long. The plaintiffs include more than 90 villages from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Brittany coast, groups of oystermen and fishermen, property owners and environmentalists They had initially sought more than $ 1.1 billion in damages.

 The campus may be dull and brown these days, but 60 tons of manmade snow will give prospective students a different view of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

Student models posed amid the manmade drifts. About 30,000 copies of the brochure are mailed to high school students each year. By late Tuesday morning, only a `` lump or two'' of the imported snow was left.

<HEAD>Panel Told Nation Should Use Natural Gas, Develop Safe Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel was told Tuesday that the nation should react to the greenhouse effect on global warming by using natural gas instead of coal and by developing `` safe and publicly acceptable'' nuclear power. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, said these are among measures needed to prevent further build-up of greenhouse gases that could be responsible for global warming. White and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists still do not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other human activities will cause significant temperature changes, leading to heat waves and drought. One witness, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee it would be more prudent to await more study before making drastic policy decisions. `` Our policy should be commensurate with the state of our scientific knowledge,'' the professor of environmental sciences told the energy and power subcommittee. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said climate experts have a `` clouded vision'' of future global warming, and added, `` basing sweeping environmental policy'' on such uncertainties `` is especially risky, even if the policy is otherwise rational.'' The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface _ the more gases, the more heat. The gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they are to outgoing infrared energy. In addition to natural build-up, greenhouse gases have increased because of human activities, including burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas; and destruction of tropical rain forests. The problem comes in trying to predict what will happen in the future. Projections are now made by scientists using mathematical models that are only approximations of the real atmosphere. White told the panel not to wait for more study to take action, suggesting, `` we can intervene through more efficient use of fossil fuels and incentives to use those that contribute least to the carbon dioxide building per thermal unit. `` For example, shifts from coal to natural gas, as well as intensified efforts to develop no-fossil energy sources such as passively safe and publicly acceptable nuclear power are desirable. `` We can work with other nations to reduce tropical deforestation. These actions should slow the climate warming.'' Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, agreed with White that action was needed now as `` insurance against catastrophic change.'' `` It's a question of what kind of risks do you want to take with the planet,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Albritton </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said even after more is learned about the greenhouse effect on global warming, lawmakers still might not be able to learn how the trend would affect their own regions. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> is a private organization created by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Jurors' Identities In Mob Case Will Not Be Kept Secret</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ruled Tuesday that the jurors selected to try mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and eight associates in a 1985 rubout will be sequestered, but their names will not be kept secret. The 59-year-old <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and his co-defendants are accused of plotting and carrying out the slaying of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Frankie Flowers'' <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON>, who was gunned down on a street near his home. Detectives said <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON> had showed `` disrespect'' to <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> by joining a rival mob faction. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> could be sentenced to death if convicted. He was convicted last year in a federal racketeering conspiracy case of running the <LOCATION> Philadelphia-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Mafia from his <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> on Tuesday sought to have the names and addresses of all prospective jurors kept anonymous, but Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> refused. `` He found no evidence that jurors would be threatened if their identity was known,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON>, an attorney for one of <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s co-defendants. The judge ruled, however, that the 12 jurors and six alternates, when chosen, will be sequestered in a hotel. Jury selection is expected to take two weeks. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> has been in jail since 1987 and is serving a 14-year sentence for conspiring to extort $ 1 million from a developer. He was acquitted in May of ordering the assassination of a rival and awaits sentencing in the racketeering case.

 Here, at-a-glance, are highlights of the major actions taken Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. PORNOGRAPHY The court ruled that states may use anti-racketeering laws to fight pornography, but invoked free-speech rights to ban the states from seizing before trial the contents of adult bookstores. The justices said authorities unlawfully seized the contents of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, bookstore before any materials in the store were judged obscene at a trial. But by a 6-3 vote, the justices said prosecutors still may use the state's anti-racketeering law to renew the obscenity case. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-470, and <LOCATION> Sappenfield </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 87-614. RELIGIOUS BOOKS The court ruled that states may not give preferential treatment to religious ublications by exempting them from sales taxes imposed on other books, newspapers and magazines. By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a now-defunct <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute violated the Constitution. The decision presumably will force the state to give sales tax refunds to non-religious publications or impose the levy against religious organizations that were exempt. The case is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Monthly vs. <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, 87-1245. SUMMARY TRIALS The court let stand rulings that the public has no right to attend the so-called `` summary jury trials'' held in some legal disputes. The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by newspapers in three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> cities that trial judges should be barred from conducting such proceedings in secret. The newspapers' lawyers had asked the high court to rule, for the first time, that the Constitution provides a public right of access to judicial proceedings in civil, or non-criminal, cases. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> vs. GE, 88-813. EVANGELISTS Television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> failed in his bid to kill a $ 90 million lawsuit by a defrocked evangelist who <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> accused of adultery in 1986. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s suit against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and others unconstitutionally entangles <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state courts in matters of church doctrine and discipline. The cases are <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, 88-1080, and Treeby vs. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, 88-1058. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION The court refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie producer who hired actors to peform sex acts in a pornographic film. The justices, without comment, let stand a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s conviction on charges of procuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedom of expression. The cases are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 88-1054, and <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 88-1050. ABORTION The court allowed <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law that included provisions for parental notification. The justices, without comment, turned down an emergency request by `` pro-choice'' advocates seeking to block the law until a federal appeals court rules on its constitutionality. The case is <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, A-582. <LOCATION> IRAN </LOCATION> ASSETS The court agreed to referee a dispute between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and American businesses stemming from the 1981 settlement of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis. The court said it will review a ruling that businesses recovering money from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government do not have to pay a portion of it to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-952. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION While agreeing to keep the identities of the legal combatants a secret, the court voted to resolve a significant dispute over the Freedom of Information Act. The justices said they will decide whether a government law enforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor being investigated for possible fraud certain documents received from another agency. Much of the case is cloaked in secrecy _ including the identity of the contractor and the government agencies involved _ presumably to protect the contractor's reputation. The case is <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1083. ANIMAL DRUGS The court allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to impose strict controls on the use of drugs by veterinarians for `` experimental'' treatment of some animal diseases. The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> drug distributing company that the government wrongly is interfering with treatment of serious animal illnesses. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> seized a large quantity of drugs July 9, 1986, from <ORGANIZATION> Schuyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rushville </LOCATION>, Ill. The case is 9 @ 1 <ORGANIZATION> KG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-614.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death sentence on novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has appalled European intellectuals and stung them into a concerted protest that appears to be spreading throughout the non-Moslem world. `` We find ourselves caught up in a religious war,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, a British commentator, wrote Tuesday.

Moslem protests began in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> soon after the novel's publication last fall, but their demonstrations and public book-burnings were widely regarded as more as a curiosity than as a threat Then came last week's riots in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> that claimed at least six lives, followed by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers. Almost immediately, British playwright <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> led a group of writers to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s doorstep to demand action over `` an intolerable and barbaric state of affairs.'' The British government's initial tactic apparently was to wait and see whether an apology from <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> might lift the death threat. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who had gone into hiding, issued an apology Saturday for causing offense to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. When that had no effect, the government decided, with its <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> partners, to get tough. On Monday the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries resolved to withdraw their envoys from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Non-EEC countries also took action. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> recalled its ambassador, and the Austrian, Swiss and Finnish governments summoned Iranian diplomats to express their condemnation. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the affair has dominated the headlines. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Marnham </PERSON>, a British writer and journalist in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, believes French intellectuals have responded much more vigorously than their British counterparts would have done if a French writer was under threat. `` They're really outraged,'' he said in an interview. After the book's French publisher suspended publication to protect its employees from <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s retribution, the weekly l'Evenement <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeudi </PERSON> proposed that French publishers put the book out en masse and share responsibility. Nearly 20 publications and publishing houses said they would participate. More than 500 authors belonging to the French section of the international <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> club wrote to Prime Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> demanding action to ensure the book was published. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, writer <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Enzensberger </PERSON> said a group of authors, including internationally renowned <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON>, had agreed to explore ways of publishing `` The Satanic Verses'' after its German publisher pulled out. Several Dutch newspapers and weeklies are to publish an ad signed by some 850 intellectuals supporting <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, and Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> has canceled a visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> wrote to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> saying <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s own history of religious censorship should rally its writers to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s defense Spanish novelist <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benet </PERSON> called the death threat `` savagery,'' and the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> as saying: `` It seems incredible to me that in the 20th century a writer could be sentenced to death for writing whatever he chooses.'' The Norwegian and Danish authors' unions said they deplored the death threat, and publishers in those countries said they would go ahead with translations. Italian novelist <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Moravia </PERSON> denounced the death threat on television, while in overwhelmingly Moslem <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, novelist <PERSON> Orhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pamuk </PERSON> published a newspaper article defending <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s right to free speech. `` If there is one thing that insults the Islamic countries, it is the decision to announce a bounty for the muirder of the authors of other countries and assign murderers to kill them,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, writing in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said the real lesson of the affair was its global nature, pitting Western concepts of freedom against Islamic fundamentalism. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is no longer an island,'' he wrote. `` Nor is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for that matter. And nor is <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Bush Brands Iran's Death Decree Against Writer ``Deeply Offensive''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condemned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death decree against British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> as `` deeply offensive to the norm of civilized behavior'' and warned on Tuesday that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would be held accountable for any actions against American interests. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he strongly supports the decision of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments to recall their ambassadors and chief diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in protest of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order for the assassination of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the author of `` The Satanic Verses,'' a novel that many Moslems consider blasphemous. On another matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not concerned that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s diplomatic trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> would diminish the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the region. Asked what role <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should play in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said emphatically, `` I think it should be a limited role and I think that's what it's going to be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not `` send somebody charging off on a mission to counter Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s trip.'' The president made his comments at a hurriedly called news conference at the White House on the eve of his departure for a five-day <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> trip to attend the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, followed by stops in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the opportunity to urge the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to `` move forthrightly'' to approve the embattled nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of defense after repeated allegations of womanizing, excessive drinking and questions about Tower's relationship with defense contractors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the allegations amounted to `` very unfair treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again.'' The president said a new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, released Monday, `` gunned down'' the allegations of misconduct. Saying Tower will be a good secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` I've never wavered in my support for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>.'' Up until now, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been silent on the worldwide controversy over the ayatollah's death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, an Indian-born British citizen who now is hiding under police protection. Many Moslems say <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book portrays the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggests that he _ rather than God _ wrote the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that, `` however offensive that book may be, inciting murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norm of civilized behavior. ... `` In the light of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s incitement, should any action be taken against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests, the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can expect to be held accountable,'' the president added. Asked if he hoped European nations impose economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did years ago, `` They will be discussing that, I'm sure, but I do n't know where we go from there.'' A number of booksellers, including some of the nation's largest chains, have taken `` The Satanic Verses'' off the shelves. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that stores should have `` protection of the law if they decide to go ahead and sell a book of this nature.'' He said `` we are in an open society. None of us like everything that's written.'' Meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday, the 12 foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nations </ORGANIZATION> decided to withdraw diplomatic representatives from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced it was withdrawing its diplomats from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> nations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the press conference to announce that second-term Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was switching his registration from Democratic to Republican. `` This is good news for our party not only in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, not only in the South, but nationally,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked his views about another Republican, former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who was elected to a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his own attempt to keep <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> from winning may have been viewed by some voters as `` improper or overkill.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s record is `` one of racism and bigotry and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out.'' On other topics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Said `` I'd like to find some way to do something'' about easy access to automatic weapons But the president, a strong opponent of gun control, added that `` I want to be the president that protects the rights of people to have arms.'' _ Tried to allay some fears that the Japanese own too much American property `` It is important if we believe in open markets that people be allowed to invest here just as I'd like to see more openness for American investors in other countries. ... We have to do a better job of knocking down barriers to American products'' overseas, he said. _ Declared `` I'm not ruling anything in or out'' on Star Wars, the planned defense shield against nuclear missiles Asked about budget aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s statement that further Star Wars development was conditional on the outcome of a 90-day review, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to close any doors or open any ... We're going to have to make some tough choices. ... Let's wait and see what the review produces.''

<HEAD>50 Detainees Freed; Hunger Strike Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government freed 50 detainees Tuesday after a hunger strike in two prisons was halted, but at least 226 detainees still are fasting elsewhere, police and lawyers said. Police said they have hospitalized 20 of the hunger strikers, who are demanding they be freed or put on trial. Many have been held without charge for more than two years. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he signed release warrants for 50 detainees. He said the hunger strikes were orchestrated outside prisons by opposition groups seeking `` to discredit the South African government.'' `` Inside the prisons it is the work of a small group of ringleaders _ hardened leftist activists _ who by means of cruel intimidation control the group to such a degree that many detainees are too afraid to break away,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. Veteran anti-apartheid legislator <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> said detainees decided on their `` extremely dangerous course'' only after exhausting all avenues for airing their grievances. `` By what criteria does the minister -LRB- <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> -RRB- decide that people must be kept away from the community?'' she asked. `` He should not be worried about saving face, he should be worried about saving lives.'' Hunger strikes continued in the southern cities of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Police said 20 hunger strikers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were hospitalized Monday, four days after they began fasting with six fellow detainees. Civil rights lawyers said at least 200 detainees in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> have begun hunger strikes in the past two weeks. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has agreed to meet lawyers for these detainees, but no date has been set. The first hunger strike started Jan. 23 and involved nearly 300 detainees held without charge in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and at Diepkloof Prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. That strike was suspended last week when <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> promised to review detainees' cases and release `` a substantial number.'' Eight detainees were freed Friday. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has been commended, even by anti-government leaders, for agreeing to meet lawyers, parents and clergymen representing the hunger strikers. However, anti-apartheid leader Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said Monday some detainees who recently quit their hunger strike could resume if they are dissatisfied by the number of releases in the next two weeks. Under the 32-month state of emergency, police can arrest anyone they believe might endanger public safety. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> decides periodically, based on reports from police officers, whether the detainee should remain incarcerated. Monitoring groups have said more than 30,000 people, mostly blacks, have been detained for some period of time during the emergency. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has never given a total figure, but he said earlier this month there were fewer than 1,000 people in detention. On Tuesday, he said no youths under 16 were in detention. He said there were 22 detainees who were 16 years old and 30 who were 17.

<HEAD>Crusading Brazilian Bishop Going Strong at 80</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Helder </PERSON> <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> has turned 80, an age at which many clergymen slip quietly into retirement. But the human rights crusader of the 1960s and 1970s remains an outspoken defender of the poor at the request of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. `` Following the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s instructions, I will not hang up my spikes,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader said. In accordance with church rules, <LOCATION> Camara </LOCATION> _ known worldwide as <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Helder </PERSON>, the Portuguese title for the high clergy _ had to retire at 75 as archbishop of <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Olinda </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s northeast coast but maintained his title. `` I'm as busy now as I ever was,'' said the short, slight prelate, seeming even smaller in a voluminous khaki cassock adorned with a simple wooden cross. The interview came amid a heavy schedule of speeches and celebrations marking his 80th birthday Feb. 7. During a right-wing military regime in the world's largest <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nation from 1964 to 1985, <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> denounced torture and human rights abuses in the face of death threats and a machine-gun attack on his parish house. The generals branded Camara the `` Red Bishop'' and banned his name from news broadcasts. His supporters nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Those dark days have ended, but <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s chronic poverty persists with the collusion of powerful economic interests, he says. `` The forces behind these conditions are well-known. Large multinational corporations create great problems here,'' he said. `` The multinationals have very different attitudes in their own countries from those they have in ours.'' In 25 years as archbishop, <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> has condemned the `` exploitation'' of the Third World by the industrialized nations. He also has criticized Communist powers for imposing their will on smaller countries, but reserves his harshest words for his main cause these days, land reform. `` It's a scandal,'' he said. `` How can 20 percent of the people own 80 percent of the land in a country 34 times the size of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>?'' Since 1980, more than 1,000 people _ mostly landless peasants _ have been killed in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in rural property disputes. `` The church supports land reform, but it does n't intend to be political. No violence or radicalization,'' the archbishop said. Asked if he agreed with progressive clergymen who endorse land invasions by the homeless, <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> paused. `` This business of invasions is funny,'' he said. `` I laugh when these big landowners say, ` My land was invaded.' Where did they get it? Was n't that an invasion?'' <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> also is `` very well informed'' about the land reform issue. `` He thinks it's now possible to end this scandal,'' he said. Although the pope has emphatically told priests to stay out of politics and has punished radical Brazilian theologists, in 1980 he met in <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Camara </PERSON>, then considered a `` non-person'' by the military government. On live nationwide and international TV, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> embraced <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Helder </PERSON> and said, `` This man is a friend of the poor. He is my friend.'' Camara remembered that with emotion. `` The pope is greater than many people think,'' he said. `` He is as great as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> XXIII </PERSON>.'' That pontiff, who reigned from 1958-63, was widely known for his warm, human character. The archbishop said he is not discouraged by the immense social problems in this country of 144 million, where modern skyscrapers exist side-by-side with miserable shantytowns, and where the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says the income distribution between the rich and the poor is the most unfair in the world. `` One thing I learned from young people: When the problems are absurd, the solutions become a passion,'' he said.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former general was named Tuesday to replace the defense minister, who resigned and reportedly alleged that government reluctance to end <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s southern civil war has isolated the country. The independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ayam </ORGANIZATION> said Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdel-Magid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> quit after returning from an unannounced visit to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where he apparently was refused new military and financial aid. Information Minister <PERSON> Beshir </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> named <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Salam </PERSON> defense minister. <PERSON> Abdul-Salam </PERSON> is a member of the prime minister's <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> party. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, who also was an army general, is an independent. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to attend the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> because of the `` emergency circumstances.'' Vice President <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> <PERSON> Banna </PERSON> and the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will represent him at the funeral, the statement said. Another newspaper, <PERSON> Al-Adwa </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>'s letter of resignation charged `` the foreign policy adopted by the government does not lead to a unified internal front nor to stability, and has also led to the isolation of the country both in the Arab and outside world.'' It said government policies `` have weakened the country's ability to acquire military and economic assistance.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged an end to the nearly 6-year-old civil war and said it would try to promote a peace settlement. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has linked further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to ending the war, and other friendly Western and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> donors say there is an urgent need to end the fighting. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, the U.S.-educated renegade colonel who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, signed a peace plan Nov. 16 with <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At the time, the Democratic Unionists belonged to the governing coalition of <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> party and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalist <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>. Although his party endorsed the plan, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> refused to let the government act on it. In December, the Unionists left the coalition because of the government's position on the peace plan and its handling of the economy. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> formed a new government in February with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> as the junior partner. The front rejects a key rebel demand _ abolition of harsh Islamic laws that are applied to all Sudanese regardless of religion. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is divided into the minority Christians and animists of the south, who are black, and the dominant Moslems of the north, who are Arabic. The Sudanese economy is faltering under the $ 1 million a day costs of the civil war, a $ 13 billion foreign debt and decreasing foreign aid.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he would not be rushed by high-profile <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy into framing a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy to deal with the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> confict. He said the Soviets should play only a secondary role in the region `` and I think that's what it's going to be.'' `` I do n't worry about a trip by Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a White House news conference. `` I have no worry about that.'' Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is in the area for talks with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders and also <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign minister. The session with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> is widely interpreted as a bid by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a larger role in trying to set up <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state, are pondering their moves after a month in office. During a tour of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capitals last week British, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> and Dutch leaders, among others, urged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to take advantage of what they perceived to be moderation by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told them he would have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats explore the situation in the area and that he would report back to the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europeans </LOCATION> at the opening of arms control negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> early next month. At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference, when the president was told by one questioner there was a perception he did not have a foreign policy. he said: `` I've never heard such an outrageous hypothesis.'' In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we have a foreign policy'' in which East-West relations, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are all under review. He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s trip, which involves the first visit by a high-level Soviet official to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 17 years, `` does n't trouble me one bit.'' Besides, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` have an opportunity to discuss a lot of things'' with other nations' leaders on his own trip with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are expected to meet with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while they are in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The president said his policy was meant to encourage `` discussions'' between <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` and to build on the progress that has been made already.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had advocated `` very useful'' changes. Apparently he was referring to Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declaration last year that he accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and had renounced terrorism `` The question is what specific steps we take next,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` and I do n't want to be rushing out because Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. I'd like to have for the first step we take of that nature to be a prudent step.'' The president added: `` I do n't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' In the past, the Soviets have backed radical Arabs and kept their distance from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with whom they broke relations after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> on Wednesday could step up a resumption of diplomatic ties, while his stop in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> where he will also see <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> separately on Wednesday suggests support for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and mainstream Arab positions. And yet, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the role of the Soviets in <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> diplomacy `` should be a limited role, and I think that's what it's going to be. ... And that's exactly the way it should be and I think the people in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> feel that way. But the fact that he goes there really should n't be bad.''

 Law enforcement officers from around the country Tuesday met to analyze what <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said before his execution and determine which victims can be tied to the serial killer. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is holding the weeklong conference of about 20 law enforcement officers at its National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. `` There are a lot of people out there, a lot of agents who have wondered if <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has committed crimes in their area,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. `` They've done them before on other serial killer cases because they -LRB- serial killers -RRB- have a tendency to move around the country. `` It's just a matter of sifting through the facts and seeing what we can come up with.'' The goal is to learn as much as possible about <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> so other convicted killers, present or future, can not file appeals attempting to shift guilt for their crimes onto <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>. `` I sure do n't want a bunch of spurious appeals trying to blame everything in the world on Bundy,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said details of the closed-door conference will be annouced Friday or Monday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last month for the murder of a schoolgirl. The former law student maintained his innocence during 10 years on death row, but as his appeals ran out and his execution date neared, he confessed to at least 23 slayings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In some instances, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> implicated himself in slayings in which he had not been a suspect or ones that investigators were unable to match to any known killings. Some law enforcement experts claim Bundy may have been involved in 100 or more slayings of young women in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Agents will try to establish <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s movements from the time he reached puberty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until his arrest in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Defense attorneys had asked the governor of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to delay <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s execution to give him time to tell more about unsolved slayings. The appeal was denied.

 Playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, whose works are performed to acclaim abroad but banned in his homeland, has become a symbol of resistance to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was convicted of participating in a banned rally and sentenced to nine months in prison. It was the latest government move against the country's best-known dissident since the 1950s. Books with the lined face of the blond, mustachioed writer are not found in Czechoslovak libraries or bookshops, but <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s outspoken human rights statements have brought him admiration beyond his works `` What is encouraging is that the young people know him,'' his brother <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> said in an interview this week at the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> flat the two share with their wives. `` This is paradoxical _ whatever happens bad to him, whatever happens good to him, everything only increases his popularity.'' When the 52-year-old <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was invited on stage at a folk music festival in September, 5,000 people cheered. When the authorities surprisingly allowed an independent demonstration in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Dec. 10, crowds chanted `` Long Live Havel!'' before he could speak. About 100 sympathizers gave the same chant Tuesday when <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was led to court, and more than 2,000 Czechoslovak intellectuals, including <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, had signed petitions for <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s release Born Oct. 5, 1936, the son of a civil engineer who built several famous <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> landmarks, he first encountered difficulties with authorities in the 1950s, when his bourgeois background barred him from university studies. Between 1963 and 1968, in a flowering of Czechoslovak culture that produced many well-known films and writers, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> had three plays performed in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. But after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was among dozens of writers whose works were banned in their homeland. A critical open letter to communist leader <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> in 1975 and his part in founding the Charter 77 human rights movement in 1977 led to almost constant harassment and detention. In the letter to <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> accused the Communist authorities of creating `` a bureaucratic order of gray monotony that stifles all individuality.'' `` True enough, the country is calm,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> wrote then. `` Calm as a morgue or as a grave, would n't you say?'' In 1979, when <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was convicted for sedition and sentenced to four years in prison, nobody in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> spoke up for him. But he already was well-known in the West, where he received numerous awards and his plays drew critical praise. In giving <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> the Erasmus Prize in 1986, the Rotterdam-based <ORGANIZATION> Erasmus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said he was driven `` by the search for truth in its purest form'' and lauded his ability to be critical of societies in both East and West. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has refused many invitations to go to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, fearing that would mean leaving behind his native <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and his wife of 24 years, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>. Last year, a book of his letters from prison to <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was published in the West. He would like to travel in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he Told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview last year. `` But I do n't think they will give me a passport,'' he added with a smile.

 A senior Palestinian official urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday not to restore ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the Jewish state support an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling 15-man Executive Committee, also accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of stalling in a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to gain time for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to crush a 14-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is pushing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> into an unconditional resumption of ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, offering in return only promises of a wider Soviet role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. `` We do n't believe the Soviets will fall into this trap,'' he said. <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> made his comments as Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> capitals in a major initiative to break the stalemate in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace effort and assert <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s influence in the region. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s 10-day, five-nation tour, the highest-ranking Soviet mission in the region in nearly 20 years, underlined <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s increasing credibility in Arab world following its military withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and its efforts to moderate the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would ask <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> about the possible restoration of <LOCATION> Israeli-Soviet </LOCATION> ties _ broken after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war _ in a meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. `` We believe any resumption of <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> ties should be linked to the convening of an international conference, attended by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have rejected <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in any such forum. <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> is also deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and headed the Palestinian side in negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that began in December. He said he still has no idea when the U.S.-PLO dialogue, suspended after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office last month, will resume. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifted its 13-year ban on public dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the talks were suspended because the new adminstration wanted to review <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> said this was `` nothing but a pretext.'' `` The reality is that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is trying to gain time for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to crush the uprising in the occupied territories so the pressure for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement will ease. `` But they're ignoring a reality which even the Israelis are slowly accepting: that it's impossible to suppress the uprising and return to the situation that existed before the uprising was launched.'' At least 380 Arabs and 15 Israelis have been killed since the uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8, 1987. <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> repeated a statement by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders have made indirect contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on peace initiatives and the uprising through third parties. `` What they've been saying through these third parties is different from their public statements,'' he noted. `` These messages are coming regularly and on a weekly basis. If Israeli leaders continue to deny that they've been in touch with us, then we shall be forced to uncover everything,'' he said, without elaboration. Israeli leaders have denied that there have been any direct or indirect contacts made with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it regards as a terrorist organization.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities were mixed in Tuesday's auction, with rates on six-month bills falling to the lowest level in nearly a month. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.2 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.51 percent, up from 8.49 percent last week. Another $ 7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.50 percent, down from 8.54 percent last week. The rates for six-month bills were the lowest since Jan. 30, when they averaged 8.39 percent. The rates for three-month bills were the highest since they averaged 8.57 percent on Feb. 6. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 8.82 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,784.90 and 9.0 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,570.30. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 9.27 percent last week, up from 9.15 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Polite Talk, Little Else as Bush, Congress Leaders Meet on Budget</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his budget director on Tuesday prodded congressional leaders to join them in budget negotiations, but Democrats responded by chiding them for withholding their views on where spending cuts should be made. Talk of more talks was put on hold while, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heading for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began budget hearings amid efforts to extract more detailed information from the White House. `` We've got an administration here that wants to embrace the concept of a line-item veto but wo n't give us a line-item budget,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The president met at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> early Tuesday with <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and other top Republicans and Democrats from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. It was the first such meeting since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revealed his $ 1.16 trillion fiscal 1990 budget in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9. Lawmakers said they told the president that before negotiations could begin they needed more detail, especially on how he would pay for the new programs he wants for education, the environment, child care and other areas. And they said the prognosis was poor for some of the specific recommendations he did include _ such as a reduction in the capital gains tax rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends cutting the rate about in half, to 15 percent, would result in more taxes being paid because economic activity would increase. Democrats not only doubt the president's supply-side math but contend the tax is a giveaway to the rich, since poor people have few capital gains. The meeting was polite but it dealt more with schedules than substance, participants said. `` The symbolism is very good. We have n't really gotten down to substance,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, predicting that once work begins, `` some serious differences will emerge'' on issues such as a $ 5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cut, one of the handful of spending cuts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did detail. `` It was important for us to emphasize we're on the right track. And we are,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman But, <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> asked, `` When does he start to make the tough choices? That's part of the process here, to find out what the choices are.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, defended the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a `` flexible freeze'' on $ 136 billion in existing programs. Those programs, mostly in domestic agencies, would be kept at last year's spending levels with selected increases allowed only if offsetting cuts were made. The White House has refused to say where it would cut and where it would support increases. Going into further detail now had little appeal for the administration, he said, since the chances were `` close to zero'' that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would agree with the administration's policy choices. `` We look forward to learning of other proposals and to discussing them on the merits,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. `` We mean to be cooperative.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said all of the budget, not just the flexible freeze, was negotiable. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., told him `` You get an ` A' for mood. But while that's important in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said agreeing on a budget is `` going to take more than a good mood.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said he thought the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was trying to take political advantage and get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to join in on putting something over on the public. `` We ca n't find it, ca n't catch it, and you say come on over to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and we'll let you in on it,'' he told <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, whom he described as `` more <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> be nimble'' than <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget director. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the budget committee, said he disagreed with the Democrats on the need for fine detail. `` I do n't think we have to know the details but rather an overall view,'' he said. However, he told <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> it was wrong to use the word `` freeze'' for both <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, which would increase with inflation, and domestic programs that would be stuck at last year's spending levels. At another hearing, before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee, Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said he did not know how much money <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing for his department's fiscal 1990 budget. There will be no set number until after the budget negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., said failure to suggest ways to pay for $ 441 million in new education programs sought by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast doubt over the seriousness of the proposals `` It is certainly legitimate to question whether ... those are in fact real initiatives or public relations initiatives which might become real at a later date,'' he said.

<HEAD>Flag Maker Defends Label-switching Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The company that suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importers of its <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags switch the `` Made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'' label to `` Made in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' said it wants nothing more to do with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protectionism. General Manager <PERSON> Ni </PERSON> <PERSON> Feng-ming </PERSON> said his company has switched to making national flags for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after the 1987 suggestion to switch labels failed to get many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> orders. `` We stopped sales to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about two years ago because our products were strongly rejected,'' Ni Feng-ming, general manager of <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` I guess Americans hate to see their national flag made by foreigners.'' The businessman added: `` American protectionism is really scary.'' Although <PERSON> Ni </PERSON> says his company no longer exports <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of protectionism and the appreciation of the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dolla, both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials have expressed concern over Ming Teh's label-switching suggestion. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has ordered closer scrutiny of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags from <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh </PERSON> following complaints from American flag manufacturers and several members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. An official at <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday authorities have started an investigation to determine whether <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh </PERSON> violated any law. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> would take measures to `` discourage any label-switching ideas.'' Ni stressed his company never changed the labels on its flags. He said a salesperson suggested in June 1987 promotional letters that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importers remove `` Made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'' tags from the company's half-finished exports and add a `` Made In <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' label once processing was completed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh </PERSON> dyed and printed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies did cutting and sewing, according to Ni. The huge <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has led to friction between the two countries. Last year, the surplus was $ 10.4 billion on total trade of $ 36.43 billion. <PERSON> Mou </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> External </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh </PERSON> was just `` trying to be considerate'' by offering an alternative to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importers who wanted to buy Taiwan-made flags but did not want to upset <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag makers.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up `Exclusionary Rule' Case from Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will consider relaxing significantly the so-called `` exclusionary rule'' that bars from criminal trials any evidence police seized unlawfully. The court said it will use a case from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to decide whether statements made by a criminal defendant after an unlawful arrest may be used by prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial testimony. The court previously has allowed prosecutors to use unlawfully seized evidence to contradict a defendant's own trial testimony. But the justices never before have allowed the use of such evidence to rebut other witnesses' testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 4-3 vote, allowed such evidence to be introduced at the trial of <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, sentenced to 30 years in prison for a 1982 murder. <PERSON> James </PERSON> was 15 when arrested in his mother's beauty parlor for two Aug. 30, 1982, shootings. He was tried as an adult. Prosecutors said <PERSON> James </PERSON> shot and killed <PERSON> Geliria </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> and wounded another youth in a late-night confrontation on a south <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street. Several prosecution witnesses identified <PERSON> James </PERSON> as the triggerman, and testified that on the night of the crime he had long, reddish-brown hair. At his trial, <PERSON> James </PERSON> had short, black hair. <PERSON> James </PERSON> did not testify at his trial but two defense witnesses testified in his behalf. One said that <PERSON> James </PERSON> had short, black hair the night of the shootings. Prosecutors then won court permission to let a police detective testify that <PERSON> James </PERSON>, when arrested, said he had long, reddish-brown hair the night of the crime. The trial judge previously had ruled that <PERSON> James </PERSON>' arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not have a court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing a crime. As a result, the police detective was not allowed to testify directly about what <PERSON> James </PERSON> had told him the night of the arrest. But the detective was allowed to testify about <PERSON> James </PERSON>' remarks to rebut the defense witness' testimony. In a related case from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the court said it will decide whether evidence obtained unlawfully after a defendant has been arraigned can ever be used in court. A <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> appeals court said no, and threw out <PERSON> Tyris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemont </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s 1986 conviction in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on charges of criminal sexual conduct. He had been sentenced to six to 10 years in prison. The state court said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> was entitled to a new trial because a police officer should not have been allowed to testify about comments <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> made during an unlawful police interrogation six days before his trial. The testimony was not offered as part of the prosecution's case but only to rebut some of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s trial testimony. The state court acknowledged that evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights _ to be free from unreasonable police searches and the privilege against self-incrimination _ sometimes may be used to rebut or impeach a defendant's testimony. But it ruled that the statement made to the police officer violated <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s Sixth Amendment right to effective legal help. `` A statement so acquired may not be used for any purpose, including impeachment,'' the state court ruled. The ruling was appealed by <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors. The cases are <PERSON> James </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 88-6075, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 88-512.

 Seven months after a risky escape by boat from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said Tuesday he is ready to take another risk and return to his communist homeland. `` I miss my parents and family,'' the 29-year-old told reporters who visited the <ORGANIZATION> Argyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where he and 79 other Vietnamese are awaiting repatriation. They are expected to return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> next month and will be the first group of boat people to go home voluntarily from this British colony, which has more than 25,000 Vietnamese languishing in camps. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, said he was afraid of being imprisoned in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but would go back anyway because he was homesick for his family. He decided he wanted to go home a month after his July 17 arrival in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Other Vietnamese who plan to go back also mentioned their families left behind. <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang </PERSON>, 30, who fled to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> with his wife and three children, said he decided to return `` because my parents are in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and there is nobody to take care of them.'' <PERSON> Dien </PERSON>, who spoke as his 4-year-old son sat weeping in his lap, said he did not know whether he would be punished when they returned. Asked if he were frightened, he slowly shook his head and said: `` I am not afraid.'' Both men said they were from the Vietnamese town of <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> and that they fled to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, about 500 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, because others had done so. The trips typically are made in overcrowded and rickety craft. Reporters previously had not been allowed to speak with the boat people who have agreed to return home. Only 22 boat people voluntarily returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> between 1979, when nearly 70,000 arrived, and 1988. But a tough new <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> policy that no longer accepts all boat people as eligible for resettlement appears to have convinced some Vietnamese to return home. The Argyle Center group was issued travel documents by an official <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> delegation that visited the colony this month. They were among the more than 10,000 boat people who have arrived since the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government introduced a policy in June under which Vietnamese face forced repatriation unless they can prove they fled their homeland because of persecution. Most boat people who have arrived since the new policy took effect wo n't be granted refugee status, and those who are eligible for resettlement might have to wait years before they are accepted by another country. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> officials have said they hope smooth repatriation of the first group will lead other boat people to volunteer to go home. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement late last year on the voluntary return of boat people. Under it, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> agreed to treat returnees well and the international organization is to provide them with assistance.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> joined rescuers and survivors of last month's British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> air crash at a memorial service Tuesday for the 47 people who died. Before a gathering of 1,300 people at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Anglican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, leaders of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s four main churches unveiled a scroll for permanent display listing the names of those who died when the Belfast-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 crashed in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Jan. 8.

<HEAD>Peace Talks End With No Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A second round of multilateral peace talks on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> ended without agreement Tuesday as negotiators failed to bridge major differences between the warring factions. `` We have n't reached agreement on many points,'' said <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, who organized the three-day talks. `` On many points, further discussions will have to be done.'' A statement cited differences among the four warring Cambodian factions, notably establishing an interim government. It said participants agreed the Cambodians will continue discussions among themselves. <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said results of those talks would determine when to resume multilateral discussions. The <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks were aimed at ending <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 10-year military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. They brought together leaders of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, its ally <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and three allied guerrilla groups opposing it _ the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and non-communist forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. Also participating were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which backs the resistance _ <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The Cambodian factions clashed throughout the talks and in more than one arena. According to a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military officer, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government troops broke a lull of several weeks on the eve of the talks to trade heavy mortar and artillery fire Saturday and Sunday near the key <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION>. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not know if there were casualties. At the talks, the pro-Vietnamese government insisted it be allowed to govern while elections are held. The guerrillas demanded the Phnomh Penh regime be replaced by a provisional government of all four factions. `` How can you hold free elections in a communist state?'' said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s son and representative, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> boycotted the talks because he said his proposals already have been rejected. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s representative, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, was more upbeat, telling reporters `` the conference has been successful.'' Vietnamese officials first met the resistance at the first multilateral talks in July. That also was marked by bitter clashes. But from it emerged the consensus that a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> must be linked to preventing a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> said the talks had to fail because the real solution lay with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which arms the 50,000-70 ,000 Vietnamese soldiers in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms the guerrillas He said nothing would be achieved before the May 15-18 Sino-Soviet summit, the first in 30 years. Both communist powers recently have softened their positions and declared their commitment to a negotiated Cambodian settlement. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Jakarta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Tuesday quoted <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the pro-Vietnamese government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, as saying, `` I do not believe my ally -LRB- the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- will ever put pressure on me.'' Millions have been killed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1970, when a coup ended <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s 30-year rule. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> became engulfed in the U.S.-Vietnam war, and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime that seized power in 1975 killed hundreds of thousands in slave labor camps and execution chambers in trying to create a new agrarian society.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to leave his post this summer to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a job in private business, a knowledgeable source said Tuesday. <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will stay on at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> through a summit of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other leaders of the 16 alliance nations, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. No formal date has yet been set for the high-level gathering, although officials have said they expect it to be in late May in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Keel will likely leave his job soon after the summit, probably in June, said the source. `` He intends when he goes back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to go in the private sector,'' he said. The source noted reports that Keel might be in the running for other jobs in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration but said <PERSON> Keel </PERSON> has asked that his name not be considered. A successor has not been announced. Keel, 45, was sworn in as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on March 13, 1987. Prior to that, he was acting assistant for national security affairs to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 Lithuanian's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday published a decree making Lithuanian the official language of the Baltic republic to be used in all spheres of life, including education and government, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. At the same time, a plenum of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> issued a warning to nationalists to avoid a policy of confrontation. The decision to make Lithuanian the official language was adopted by the republic's legislature in October after years of pressure from nationalist groups and came into force with the publication of the decree by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Congresses, sessions, plenary meetings and other forums are to be held in Lithuanian,'' the official news agency said in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` If need be, translation of reports into Russian or from Russian into Lithuanian will be organized. The same goes for contacts with citizens at governmental or public institutions, at public health and communal services and judicial bodies.'' Lithuanians account for approximately 80 percent of the 3.6 million population. `` Most Russians, Poles, Byelorussians and Jews living in the republic speak Lithuanian,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, a factor taken into consideration when drafting Tuesday's decree. In a separate dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a plenum of the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday discussed the implications of the nationalist movement on President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic restructuring, known as perestroika `` In <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, forces have been formed which in words are for the speeding-up of perestroika, but in deeds hamper it by their many actions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency said a situation had been created in which there was a threat of splitting Lithuanian society. `` The plenum stressed the urgency of the adoption of decisions and resolute measures for cohesion of the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> party organizations and demanded from party organizations and from all communists to meet any threat of nationalist hostility and nationalist chauvinism,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would continue to assess the activities of unofficial nationalist movements.

<TEXT>
 Organizers of a proposed public garden in the nation's capital to provide a `` living monument to peace'' opened a national competition Tuesday for its design. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the idea _ the inspiration of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratcliff </PERSON>, a former teacher from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed it into law in June 1987, giving organizers five years to raise the $ 4 million to $ 6 million for the project. Applicants must register with the Peace Garden Competition by May 26 and submit designs by the end of August. The winning design will be announced in September. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> has given the Peace Garden Project a $ 75,000 grant to help finance the competition, and the California-based <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LEF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> also have donated money. Organizers estimate it will cost $ 250,000 to conduct the design contest, including awarding prizes of $ 20,000 for the winner, $ 10,000 for second place, $ 5,000 for third place, and $ 500 prizes for honorable mention. The project will be constructed with the help of private funds. The federal government will own and maintain it the garden, located on six acres at <LOCATION> Hains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> near the Jefferson Memorial. Mrs. <PERSON> Ratcliff </PERSON> said the inspiration for a National Peace Garden came to her when she was visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1985. `` I just looked around and saw all the great monuments to the past and all the wars we've been involved in,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ratcliff </PERSON> said. `` It just suddenly came into my mind that what we needed in our capital is a living monument to peace.''

 Eighty sick and wounded <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> prisoners of war arrived home Tuesday after being freed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with some falling to kiss the ground as they stepped off the plane. Also on Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official said the first U.N.-sponsored meeting between <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and Iranian officers has been postponed indefinitely. It had been scheduled for Wednesday. The 80 POWs are the first of 260 sick and wounded prisoners <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it would free to mark the 10th anniversary of its revolution earlier this month. Iraqi officials at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> said the Iranians informed the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> they would repatriate 83 prisoners, but later said three had asked for political asylum. A senior Iraqi officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the all-Swiss <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> had informed them 16 of the 260 prisoners opted to stay in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Military police kept reporters away from the POWs, who all wore gray track suits. At least 10 were in wheelchairs or carried on stretchers. <PERSON> Gini </PERSON> <PERSON> Antone </PERSON>, a doctor of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> who accompanied them on the plane from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, said the prisoners were sick but there were no serious injuries. <PERSON> Antone </PERSON> said morale was high during the 2 -LCB- - hour flight, with prisoners looking forward to returning home Iraqi medical staff at the airport said the POWs will be taken to a military hospital for more tests and will stay as long as they need treatment. Most returnees were taken prisoner in early days of the war, which started in September 1980. A jet chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> committee carried them home. The plane will return to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to bring the second batch of prisoners Wednesday and the final group should arrive Thursday, said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Luethold </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the war Aug. 20. But peace negotiations have stalled and an agreement to exchange prisoners in November collapsed over mutual recriminations of bad faith, including the numbers requesting asylum on both sides. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered 50,182 prisoners held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate they total 100,000. Further delays to the peace process were announced by a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official who said the two countries can not agree on where their Mixed Military Group should meet. They were to meet Wednesday along the road between the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Khanaqin </LOCATION> and the Iranian border town of <LOCATION> Qasr-e-Shirin </LOCATION> in the central sector of the war front and cease-fire line. Officials refused to say which country expressed reservations on the venue. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials are trying to negotiate a solution. The military officers were supposed to handle issues arising from implementation of the cease-fire.

<TEXT>
 The Planned Parenthood Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> took aim at leaders of the pro-life movement Tuesday in a new $ 2 million national campaign to `` Keep Abortions Safe and Legal.'' The campaign will try to mobilize more than 1 million people to work at the local, state and national levels on public education about abortion and the consequences of women losing the right to choose to end their pregnancy. In addition, Planned Parenthood is running advertisements in national magazines and newspapers around the country, charging that pro-life leaders oppose not just abortion, but contraception and sex education as well. One of the ads quotes fundamentalist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> as saying: `` Sex education classes in our public schools are promoting incest;'' and <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, a leader of the campaign to block abortion clinics, as saying: `` I do n't think Christians should use birth control.'' The purpose of the ads is to educate Americans about the tactics and hidden agendas of the other side, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, acting president of Planned Parenthood. `` We believe the more the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know about the people who are opposing abortion rights in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the more compassionate they're going to be in supporting abortion rights,'' he said. The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be the largest pro-life organization in the country, accused Planned Parenthood of using `` scare tactics'' in their ads. `` They're taking instances and blowing them out of proportion,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinegar </PERSON>. `` They're scaring women into believing that anyone who is pro-life is also against contraception and is in favor of putting women who have had abortions in jail.'' <PERSON> Dinegar </PERSON> said his organization takes no position on the issue of contraception. But <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> insisted that abortion opponents are giving Americans a preview of what to expect if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in its upcoming review of its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, allows abortion rights to be limited. `` One need to look no further than the case of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>,'' he said, referring to the comatose <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman whose husband had to fight pro-life attempts to stop him from allowing doctors to terminate his wife's pregnancy in hopes of improving her chances for survival. `` The millions of Americans who were profoundly offended by this monstrous attack on a family's privacy must remember that we will face scores of cases like this if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> weakens in any way the current laws regarding abortion,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. In getting its message to the public, Planned Parenthood hopes to catch the eyes of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices who could severely limit abortion rights granted under the court's 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. `` They do not live in a vacuum,'' said ... `` They are just as prone to read and be influenced by the media and public opinion polling and the force of public pressure that can be brought to bear on an issue like this.'' A <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll of 1,248 randomly selected adults, surveyed last month, found that 56 percent favor retaining <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> while 42 percent want the decision overturned; and 68 percent oppose a constitutional amendment to ban abortions while 29 percent are in favor. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Part of Planned Parenthood's strategy is to organize Republicans `` to tell President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that in a kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> there is no room for back-alley abortions,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` Make no mistake,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` Back-alley abortions will result if the opponents of abortion succeed. Abortion has always been and will always be available, even when and where it is illegal.'' Planned Parenthood said it would spent $ 2 million from its national budget on the campaign and supplement that with resources from its 178 affiliates across the country.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, on the eve of separate talks with Israeli and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, said Tuesday he would try to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s 10-day Middle East initiative faces its toughest test Wednesday when he meets Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> in an effort to sell <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on his peace plan. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> warned that arranging peace talks could be a lengthy process. `` Peacemaking in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a very difficult exercise. It is a painfully slow process. But we are both convinced that very intensive efforts have to be made to try to put momentum in the process and try to move the process forward,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, speaking to reporters after meeting <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, also indicated that preparatory moves might take a long time. `` We will keep on discussing and talking and having a dialogue, a means we believe in even if the dialogue takes a long time,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is adamantly opposed to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. It also has serious reservations about the Soviet concept of an international conference, which would include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are trying to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' to enter negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidqi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leaving on a four-day trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was chilly toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal of a U.N.-sponsored <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. `` We do n't believe the international conference can serve the cause of peace, but it was their -LRB- the Soviets' -RRB- idea so it is not surprising they should raise it,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. He did not, however, rule out further discussions, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have hinted some compromise might ultimately be possible to overcome <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fears that such a conference would be biased against the Jewish state. On the eve of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, there was rising speculation that it might set the stage for restoration of diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> severed ties after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> lands. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> declined to comment on the prospects for renewing ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But the prospect clearly alarmed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s information department and a member of the organization's 15-man Executive Committee, said the Soviets should not renew relations unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accepted an international conference. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is pushing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> into an unconditional resumption of ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, offering in return only promises of a wider Soviet role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> said in a telephone interview <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. `` We do n't believe the Soviets will fall into this trap,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has insisted it would accept a Soviet role in peacemaking only if ties are renewed. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was vague about what might happen concerning Israeli-Soviet ties. He restated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s position that the lack of relations was not normal and said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` knows the means'' for bringing about a change. The Soviets have indicated they would like to see <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> take a demonstrative step to match <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements in December that he accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terror. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met earlier with <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> to review his proposal, unveiled earlier in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and its five permanent members lay the groundwork for a peace conference to be convened within nine months. The five permanent council members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ would sit as a preparatory committee to arrange the conference. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` agreed on the importance ... convincing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of the importance of peace, withdrawal from the occupied territories and giving Palestinians self-determination,'' an <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Wednesday about the time that <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> was flying home to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We are trying to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' to enter negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidqi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s three-day <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> visit has been the focal point of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour that has prompted questions about whether <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> snatched the peacemaking initiative from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied he had yielded ground to the Soviets and said he did n't want to be rushed into sending an emissary to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He said Soviet involvement was a `` good thing,'' and he wanted to take `` prudent'' steps that would produce results.

 The prosecution demanded on Tuesday that Lebanese militant <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> be sentenced to life imprisonment for hijacking an Air Afrique DC-10 in 1987 and killing a French passenger. Prosecutor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> said the `` horror of the crime'' barred any leniency toward the 22-year-old defendant he described as a `` killer blinded by conviction.'' In a brief statement, <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, identified in court as a member of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group, said he regretted the death of passenger <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> but that the hijacking was `` not an act of terrorism but was combat.'' <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> faces charges of murder and hostage-taking in the trial in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that began Monday. The five-judge panel hearing the case is scheduled to announce a verdict and sentence on Friday. <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>'s final arguments came after testimony by passengers and crew members, including by a chief steward the Congolese chief steward, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Memba </PERSON>, who he said he was an eyewitness of the execution-style slaying of <LOCATION> Beaulieu </LOCATION>. An American on the plane said Tuesday that he began writing his will after the Frenchman was killed. <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> was shot from behind and at close distance after a three-minute deadline set by <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> for the refueling of the DC-10 at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> told the court earlier he did not intend to kill <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> but that he fired without aiming when the 28-year-old Frenchman, whose head was covered with a blanket made a threatening move. <PERSON> Memba </PERSON> said <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> was seated when he was shot and that <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> was standing behind him. `` The witness was bought, the way I bought the customs official,'' <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> protested in French. It was a reference to the $ 6 bribe he paid to slip by controls at <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where he boarded the plane with a 7.65 millimeter pistol, 140 rounds of ammunition and 562 grams of TNT. The French pilot, <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Artizzu </PERSON>, testified that a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramlawi </PERSON>, who negotiated with <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> at the request of Swiss authorities, was to be credited for talking the hijacker out of killing a second passenger. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> earlier said <PERSON> Ramlawai </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> mission, was a `` traitor'' and blamed him for the failure of his mission. The plane, bound for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was diverted over northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> July 24, 1987 with <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> demanding the release of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and Palestinian prisoners held by French, West German and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. The ordeal ended when crewmembers overpowered <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> while Swiss police stormed the plane. In earlier testimony, the lone American hostage in the drama said he wrote his will on a page of a travel journal after he saw <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON>'s body taken off the plane by two stewards. `` This was the first point at which I really expected to die -LRB- too -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroth </PERSON>, 42. `` I prepared a will which I gave to the steward.'' <PERSON> Schroth </PERSON>, a lawyer and <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, businessman, was the first passenger directly threatened by <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> while he was collecting passports to sort out <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nationals. He said <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> picked him after he was unable to turn over his passport because it was in his suitcase. `` He placed his pistol against the back of my head and shouted to the other passengers, ` Look at this man, if anyone moves he will die.'''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for rescuing the savings and loan industry is based on overly optimistic economic assumptions and understates the program's true cost by billions of dollars, private analysts said Tuesday. The White House Office of Management Budget released figures Tuesday showing, among other assumptions: _ long-term interest rates falling 3 percent in two years to the lowest point in 20 years _ savings and loan deposits growing at an annual rate of 7.2 percent even as the government will be curbing high-flying, fast-growing institutions `` These assumptions are highly optimistic, exceedingly optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` They're just not realistic.'' If the administration's interest rate projections are off, the government will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more a year to finance the borrowing. If the deposit growth is lower than predicted, then insurance premiums paid by the industry will fall far short of the $ 32 billion projected over the next decade. That will mean taxpayers will have to pay more. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan calls for raising $ 50 billion by selling bonds over the next three years. The bonds will be sold in an off-budget arrangement, which means the government will have to pay more in interest than on normal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> plan shows the special S & amp; L bonds carrying a rate 0.3 percentage points higher than long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> rates. That's `` a shade optimistic,'' according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, a banking expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. More importantly, however, the government shows long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> rates falling from about 9.2 percent now to 6.2 percent in 1991, which would be the lowest rate since 1968. `` To say that that's optimistic is the understatement of the year,'' <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> said. Analysts said the deposit projections are in line with the growth rate of the past 10 years, but are likely too high if the administration follows through with other parts of its reform program. S & amp; Ls under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan would not be allowed to grow unless their owners put up more of their own money. `` There's no way thrift deposits are going to grow that fast in light of the capital requirements,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said. He also said the interest rate projections imply a very low rate of inflation and, in the unlikely event that occurred, it would make it much harder to meet the deposit growth targets. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday looked at requiring independent certified public accountants hired by individual S & amp; Ls to exchange information with federal regulators on whatever they uncover in their audits. The committee was reviewing a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> check of 11 failed S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> which found that accounting firms, including some of the nation's largest, failed to uncover problems in six of the 11. While the six institutions showed a net worth of $ 44 million in the independent accountants' audits, their net worth five to 17 months later when they failed was a negative $ 1.5 billion, said Assistant Comptroller General <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the S & amp; L industry, should have uncovered the audit problems long ago. `` Of the six audits found deficient by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> _ and these include some of the most renowned horror stories _ the bank board has not taken action against a single one,'' he said. In another development, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee overseeing S & amp; Ls, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures commercial bank deposits, may be too overworked to take on oversight the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry As part of the president's reform proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> would get jurisdiction over nearly 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. However, <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, who is fighting to keep <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulation separate from bank regulation, said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> in the last two years has not conducted on-site safety and soundness examinations at hundreds of commercial banks under its oversight. `` With over 200 bank failures last year ... we should be stepping up the number and frequency of bank ... examinations. Instead, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan will saddle the insurer of deposits in these banks with significant new responsibilities,'' he complained.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will offer to reduce some of the alliance's conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when they meet officials of the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> pact in arms talks next month, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative at the upcoming arms negotiations, said the proposal will be `` below but not too far below'' existing levels for the Western alliance. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, speaking on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government satellite broadcast from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was still working on its position for the talks on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, scheduled to begin early next month in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` We will be approaching the problem by trying to reduce the asymmetries, the disparities, which ... in almost all defense categories are in favor of the East,'' he said. `` We will not simply recommend that the East do all of the reduction, but we for our part will offer to do some of the reduction too,'' he said. Asked by a questioner about reports in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that the West would offer a 5 percent cut in conventional forces, <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> replied: `` While the percentage you mentioned is not firmly nailed down, it is ... within the ballpark.'' The Western alliance contends the Soviets and their allies have built up a huge superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and the seven of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact will take part in the negotiations which will cover the area from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said the Western nations would like to focus the initial bargaining on reducing main battle tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers to equal levels. The Western approach, he said, `` will be to try to concentrate on those military equipments and armaments that give to one side or the other the capability to ... launch a surprise attack or sustained large-scale offensive activity.'' Previous East-West talks on reducing forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ called the mutual and balanced force reductions negotiations _ ended early this month after dragging on for more than 15 years without resolution. The two sides could not agree on mutual troop strength and methods to police an eventual withdrawal. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> declined to speculate on how long the upcoming talks might go on.

<HEAD>GAO Says Agency Officials Ordered Changes in Report on Spotted Owl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials, in an effort to keep the spotted owl off the endangered list, ordered changes in a report which originally said the bird may face extinction, according to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report released Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said officials ignored scientific evidence and ordered revisions in a study prepared by biologists in the agency's Northwest regional office. Scientists had concluded that unless logging was slowed in ancient forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the owl could face extinction. The timber industry in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> has opposed any effort to name the owl a threatened or endangered species, fearing that such a move would disrupt logging in public forests. Environmentalists have advocated protecting the owl as part of their campaign to halt logging of old growth forests. `` While changes are an inevitable part of any draft report review process, the nature of the changes made in this case and the way they were made raise questions about whether objectivity was maintained,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency which determines what should be designated for protection as threatened or endangered, is required to consider only `` biological factors'' in making its decision. The service concluded in December 1987 that the owl, which lives only in old growth forests of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was not endangered, and refused to grant a petition requesting that the bird be protected. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said decisions on whether to classify a bird, animal or plant as endangered `` can often be surrounded by highly emotional debates centered on the decision's possible economic consequences rather than its biological merits. `` In such cases especially, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> needs to be able to demonstrate that its review process and ultimate decisions have been thorough, independent, and objective as possible,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There is evidence the spotted owl process did not meet such standards.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said agency `` management officials substantially changed the body of scientific evidence'' found in the original report. `` The revisions had the effect of changing the report from one that emphasized the dangers facing the owl to one that could more easily support denying the listing petition,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency's decision not to list the owl as endangered was challenged in court and a federal judge has given the service until May 1 to provide additional information on how it reached its decision. An agency spokesman on Tuesday declined comment on the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report. `` We would like to at least read it first,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiben </PERSON>, a Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to list the spotted owl as an endangered species appears to have been based on politics, not science or law,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass. He said he planned to ask Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> about the case at a hearing Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore., said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report shows the decision not to protect the owl was a `` simple case of political expediency winning out over sound scientific evaluation and good policy `` We need the scientific facts about the spotted owl, not the biased views of political appointees at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s criminal trial opened Tuesday with the prosecutor portraying him as a liar who `` places himself above the law'' but with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer defending him as a patriotic Marine who obeyed unflinchingly the orders of his commander in chief. North, now retired from the service, listened intently as prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the jury the defendant had lied time and again to his president and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the Iran-Contra affair. Chief defense lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former top <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, worked in a secret world where `` he always acted with the approval of his superiors; he acted always with the best interests of his country.'' Thus the two sides squared off for the oft-delayed first trial to come out of the Iran-Contra affair, a trial that may take as much as five months to complete. The first testimony comes Wednesday morning when Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, takes the stand <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the jury Tuesday that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had profited personally by using traveler's checks furnished by a Contra leader and, on a broader scale, had told lies that amounted to `` a crime that goes to the soul of our self-government.'' `` You will hear he considers himself a patriotic person, but there is no higher patriotic purpose than to protect our system of government,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. `` To lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because you mistrust it then is a crime and not a defense.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> did portray <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a patriot, saying he believed in the Marine motto `` Semper Fidelis'' _ always faithful. `` He lived with that <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> motto. He was always faithful to country, to commander in chief, to his family, to those whose lives depended on him,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. And yet, said the defense attorney: `` Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> has in the end been abandoned by his government.'' North's eyes moistened as <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> wound up his opening statement almost in a whisper. The lawyer said that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the troubleshooter at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and if `` a secret mission had to be accomplished, it was ` Let Ollie do it.''' When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided not to support the Nicaraguan freedom fighters in 1984, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, `` the president was angry ... and he vowed he would find a way to support them.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> `` to keep them together body and soul and it was then the job of <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. He recited a lengthy version of the history of the Iran-Contra affair to the jury, some of whose members appeared to be nodding off. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> noted that while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was barred by law from directly helping the Contras, officials solicited funds for the cause from other countries. He quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying privately at the time, `` If this leaks out, we'll all be hanging by our thumbs outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> until we find out who did it.'' North followed the opening statements of <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> with unflagging interest. He sat upright during the presentations which took four hours, sometimes looking toward his wife, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>, who was in the front row of spectators. The courtroom was filled to its 120-seat capacity, with reporters taking 60. The public got only 15 and the rest went to assorted lawyers, prosecutors and government security experts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> allowed four representatives of intelligence agencies in court to monitor the large amounts of classified information expected to be revealed publicly in the trial. North is charged with 12 criminal counts, nine of them having to do with deceiving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president. The other three involve charges that he personally profited from the Iran-Contra affair. `` The need for secrecy is no excuse for lies,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. At one point, he said, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee had met with <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seeking the truth about the situation. `` The committee looked <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> right in the eye and <PERSON> North </PERSON> looked them right in the eye and he lied,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> took $ 4,000 of the $ 90,000 in traveler's checks that <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> gave him to cover expenses. `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> used that $ 4,000 like it was his personal piggy-bank'' for groceries, tires and to take his family on a trip, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the jury. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> called <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fabrications to a presidential inquiry an extraordinary criminal act `` by a man who at some point stops playing by the rules and places himself above the law.'' But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> North </PERSON> never broke the law, that `` he followed the instructions of the highest-ranking officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' North was a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel with 20 years service and a distinguished <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War record when he resigned from the service after his indictment last March. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who became known nationally during the 1987 congressional hearings on the affair, held up thumb and forefinger a quarter-inch apart and told the jury: `` He never had this much criminal intent.'' North testified at the hearings under immunity from prosecution for anything he might say. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, working for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, had to develop his evidence for the trial without recourse to the hearing transcript. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the jury that the Bible says there is a time and place for everything. `` When the time came for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to tell the truth, he lied,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. `` When the time came to come clean, he shredded, erased and altered. When the time came to let the light shine in, he covered up.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will use a case involving an abandoned movie project to examine penalties for law firms accused of breaking a rule against needless lawsuits. The court agreed to hear an appeal by a defunct <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law partnership ordered to pay $ 50,000 for violating the rules. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Northern </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON>, an actor who plays the character <PERSON> David </PERSON> on television's `` Sesame Street. `` Calloway sued <ORGANIZATION> Marvel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and others, accusing them of copyright and other violations on a proposed animated science fiction movie to be called `` The Skyrider. <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> sought $ 44 million in damages. A federal judge imposed $ 100,000 in sanctions against <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON>, $ 50,000 against his attorney, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFlore </PERSON>, and $ 50,000 against the now dissolved law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Pavelic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; LeFlore.

 Computer-equipped citizens can fire off an angry electronic letter to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, see if their favorite book is at the library or check the bus schedule in a pioneering program switched on Tuesday. Experts say <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Monica </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> is at the leading edge of a national trend linking local governments to their constituents through computers. This affluent coastal <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb began enrolling computer owners in the service Tuesday, and City Manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalili </PERSON> said interest appeared high, though a customer count for the free service was n't immediately available. Once a citizen has been enrolled and assigned a password to get into the system, he or she will be able to tap into city files on proposed developments and other <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> action, find out how to get city permits and licenses, get schedules for city services and get a range of consumer advice. They'll also be able to sound off, directing `` electronic mail'' at council members, department heads and the public at large. The city promises to respond. `` I love it,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a teacher and active citizen who was the first to sign up for PEN. `` We live in an electronic age and we have this technology that allows us to use computers to access information.'' He planned to fire up his home computer Tuesday afternoon to offer some ideas on how to fit a park improvement project into the new budget. `` Then I'll probably e-mail -LRB- electronic mail -RRB- the information services department head and congratulate him on a job well done,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. The system is housed in a computer separate from the city's internal data processing to head off the threat of `` hackers'' seeking inside information or planting destructive viruses Although <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Monica </PERSON>'s system appears to go further than most, many local governments around the country are experimenting with computer citizen communications, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Shogry </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, group that researches technology for local governemnts. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, have `` 24-hour City Halls,'' which allow citizens to browse through reams of information using computer kiosks set up in public places, he said. The organization is planning a 12-city test later this year of a `` videotext'' information system linking citizens with their governments. The cities have yet to be chosen. <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, have `` voice mail'' systems for callers to get recorded information on a variety of services and problems, he said. `` It's attracting a lot of interest by local governments across the country,'' <PERSON> Shogry </PERSON> said. `` There's a growing awareness of how telecommunications and computer technology can be used to involve more people.'' <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Monica </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Jalili </PERSON> sees the system as a way to improve service to citizens. `` First of all, it's going to stop the phone game where people are transferred to eight different places,'' <PERSON> Jalili </PERSON> said. `` And there are people who during their work day ca n't call in and when they get home City Hall is closed.'' Of course, many people who need help or information from City Hall do n't have personal computers. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, known for the liberal politics of such celebrity residents as actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, project organizers are sensitive to the perception they're bypassing the poor. Terminals have been installed in all libraries and there are plans to put them in recreation buildings and in a senior citizens' center under construction Elsewhere, the equipment put in public places is designed for easy use by those who are n't familiar with computers: Some have touch-sensitive screens to make typing unnecessary, and all have simple instructions to lead users throught the microchip maze. `` My personal opinion is that for the electronic democracy to become a reality, the needs of the poor or less educated will have to be kind of aggressively addressed,'' <PERSON> Shogry </PERSON> said. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>, a survey found 33 percent of residents owned personal computers and 23 percent had modems, the devices needed to allow the computers to communicate over telephone lines. For now, the experiment is free to the city and to subscribers. The $ 350,000 system was a gift from two computer companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> donated the machines and <ORGANIZATION> Metasystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> provided the software. But fees are n't ruled out in the future, said <PERSON> Jalili </PERSON>, depending on how much staff time is involved.

<HEAD>Soviet President Defends Policy on Cooperatives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday defended a government order freezing cooperatives out of the medical business, saying the private business was taking up too many government resources. His remarks, broadcast on the evening TV news program `` Vremya,'' came on a visit to <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> on his trip to the Ukrainian republic. The 57-year-old Soviet leader toured a television factory, addressed city scientific and cultural leaders, and held discussions with groups of citizens at the airport and on street corners. The official Soviet media said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> area on his trip, nearly three years after the world's worst nuclear power plant disaster occurred there. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in response to a complaint from an elderly woman about medical cooperatives that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> officials heard some medical equipment was not being used in the state-run system so it would be ready for cooperatives, which charge their patients. `` After 2 or 3 o'clock, everything worked fine,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It turned out that in the first part of the day it was being prepared to be used for cooperatives.'' In late December the government ordered cooperatives out of the medical field, TV stores and other potentially high-profit services that also require relatively big investments. Government officials said they moved against medical cooperatives to ensure public health. But leaders of the cooperative movement saw it as an effort to keep them out of profitable areas. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pushed the cooperative movement as a means to provide goods and services that the state-run economy can not or will not provide. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> needs them but should control them through taxation and efforts to limit the amount of money their workers can earn. <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, a railway, automobile assembly and oil refining city with a population of 753,000, lies 260 miles west of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, in a part of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that became part of the Soviet Union only at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION> is still a center of Ukrainian nationalism. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> toured the Elektron factory, and factory workers told him about plans to increase output of TV sets, which <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said were in short supply. Aside from being scarce, Soviet television sets are notoriously dangerous. The state-run press has carried articles saying Soviet-made color TV sets are prone to explode and are a major cause of fires. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> found out Monday in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, that the dangers of nuclear power are still much on the minds of Ukrainians. In a street encounter broadcast on television, an elderly woman asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> why another nuclear power plant was being built in the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>. The area contains some of the country's most popular beach resorts and is home to 2 million people. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was aware of worries about plant safety. He said American specialists had been asked to study the Crimean facility. `` Construction is under way,'' he said. `` But if the conclusion -LRB- of the specialists -RRB- is that it is not advisable to build a station there, then it will be turned into a training center for personnel, not an atomic power station.'' An explosion and fire at a nuclear reactor at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> on April 26, 1986, killed at least 31 people and sent a radioactive cloud around the world. Since then, the Soviets have moved away from complete faith in the safety of nuclear power, and public opposition to it has grown. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said cancer cases have doubled in a region 30 miles from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> where people were not evacuated.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will review a law governing the use of national security secrets in criminal cases because of the legal tangle created by the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said the use of an independent counsel to prosecute North on charges of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the Iran-Contra affair had not been anticipated in the law covering how to handle secret evidence. `` In this case, the balance which the law assumed would be there does not exist,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters. `` It is obvious that the prior administration and this administration is not eagerly seeking ... prosecution. Indeed, its political interest lies in no trial at all.'' To help ensure that the administration did not forfeit the <PERSON> North </PERSON> case for political reasons, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> held a closed-door session to hear from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> on the administration's reasons for dropping conspiracy charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> in January. North's trial on 12 other charges began Tuesday. `` We heard from members of the intelligence community who shared their national security concerns about information that could be developed during the course of the trial now under way,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the intelligence panel <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> declined to say whether he was satisfied that those concerns were legitimate or to characterize <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s level of worry about the classified information, saying he did not want to open himself to charges of influencing the case. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Classified Information Procedures Act in 1980, propelled by a spate of cases in which defendants threatened to disclose government secrets as part of their defense against criminal charges. The law defines national security secrets and allows a trial judge to screen such information before a trial to determine whether the material can be used in open court. The judge can dismiss a case or specific counts of an indictment if the government objects to disclosure of classified information. The same law requires the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on cases not prosecuted or charges dropped because of fears of disclosure of secrets. `` We will carefully review -LRB- the law -RRB- when this is over to see if changes are necessary,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` We are dealing with situations here which might not have been anticipated by the law when it was written,'' added <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>. `` It would be appropriate for us to reflect upon when all is said and done'' in the North case.

<HEAD>Government to Change Inscription on Katyn Monument</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday it will change a monument inscription saying the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed more than 4,000 Polish army officers during World War II. It cited a <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> document that indicates the Soviets killed them. The announcement came from government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, who stopped short of saying that the Soviets were guilty of the crime in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. He also did not say what the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> monument will read. `` We expect that this problem will be explained by the two sides and on the basis of more comprehensive information,'' Urban told a news conference. Urban referred to a broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> on Monday which, according to Urban, said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> report was `` serious evidence requiring serious examination that the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> crime was committed by Soviet security forces in the Stalinist epoch, and not by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>.'' The 12-foot granite monument at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Powazki Cemetery has an inscription at its base saying it is `` To Polish Soldiers _ Victims of Hitlerite Fascism Resting in the Ground of <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>.'' Urban said the government also plans to move the monument, now in an out-of-the-way corner of the cemetery. The massacre in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>, is one of the most searing issues in <LOCATION> Polish-Soviet </LOCATION> relations, and for years the word itself was too sensitive to be uttered in public. Official postwar histories all maintained the officers were killed by <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in winter 1941, but most Poles and Western historians have said they were killed by the Soviets in the spring of 1940, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were still allied. In addition to the 4,300 bodies found at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, 11,000 other officers are unaccounted for and presumed dead after they were imprisoned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the first days of World War II. The officers represented about half of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prewar officer corps. The monument blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> was erected in April 1985 and unveiled without public notice after some family members of <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> victims erected unauthorized crosses at the site in memory of the slain officers. The crosses were taken down. Each Aug. 1 and Nov. 1, dates when Poles remember their war dead, large groups of people gather at the monument, and many use candles and flowers to cover over the inscription they regard as false. A joint committee of Polish and Soviet historians created in April 1987 is examining the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> issue as part of an effort to correct `` blank spots'' in the two countries' history. In November, the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> approved plans for a monument in <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> for prisoners of war, but the report gave no construction schedule.

 National Republican Party officials were in conflict with <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> GOP legislators Tuesday over how to react to the election under the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> banner of former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> won a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday and national party chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> declared the party had no intention of accepting him as a member. Under <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s direction, a resolution was prepared declaring that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was `` not a Republican in gesture, deed or belief.'' The resolution is expected to be adopted by the party's 11-member executive council, which will confer by telephone Friday. However, in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, Republican legislators said they saw no reason to reject <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` We ca n't be responsible for what he did before he was registered as a Republican,'' said Rep. Art Sour, a Republican. `` I do n't understand what <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is talking about. Censure him for what? The only control we have over him is what he's done since he's been a Republican. `` We will see if Mr. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is what he says he is or what the media says he is,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Peppi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruneau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucus chairman. `` If he's what he says he is, he has no problem. He got to the House the same way everybody else did.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also voiced concern that his effort to denounce the former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> `` plays right into his hands'' by giving <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> a new forum. `` I'm going to refrain from discussing Mr. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> anymore,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters at the White House. For national party officials, the election of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> came as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> was launching an intensive campaign to win support among blacks who have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in national elections. At a brief news conference Tuesday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded his endorsement of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s opponent might have been viewed by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> voters as `` improper or overkill.'' But, the president said, `` I did what I did because of principle ... this man, his record is one of racism and bigotry, and, I'm sorry, I just felt I had to speak out. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, defeated homebuilder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, 63, in Saturday's election for a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> despite endorsements for <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the most powerful political figures in the suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area Both candidates were registered as Republicans. `` I have no desire to impeach him from office,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman said he wanted Republicans to `` officially disassociate ourselves as a party from Mr. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> had previously run for office as a Democrat and had re-registered as a Republican only three days before the election. `` He is not a man, who, I think, stands for either party,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` He's an opportunist. ... There's a 20-year career there in which he was a man of the swastika, vehemently anti-Semitic, vehemently racist.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman said he would henceforth refrain from discussing the Duke matter because `` it plays right into his hands. What he wants is to get into a prolongued argument with me on television, any other kind of media. `` He's a very effective demagogue and I'm not going to give him an opportunity to do that any more. ... I'm not going to let myself become a dupe in his play to get more free media coverage.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> reiterated his contention that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> `` does not represent our party in any shape, form or fashion.'''

 A Frenchman fell to his death doing what he had done more than anyone else in the world _ parachute jumping. `` He would jump with anybody anytime,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parachute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where 59-year-old <PERSON> Roch </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> died Monday when his parachute failed to open properly. `` That was his whole life.'' Charmet, who held the world record for the most parachute jumps with more than 14,000, had made six jumps when he went up for what was to be the last for the day. <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> on Tuesday recalled that on the way up <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> played a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> drinking song, something about knights of the Round Table drinking wine, on a harmonica he recently learned to play. Charmet jumped out at 2,500 feet. `` Normally, you wait three or four seconds and pull out a hand-deployed pilot chute,'' said <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>. `` I could see him fighting with something. At 500 feet the pilot chute came out, then just a ball of material is all we could see.'' He pulled the release on his back-up parachute, but it was too late, <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> landed on a stack of lumber. An investigator from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> arrived Tuesday to inspect the parachute gear, which <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> had packed himself. <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Montlhery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and was an instructor with the <ORGANIZATION> Parachute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. Small and lightly built with a gray beard and long gray hair, he learned to jump while serving with the French Foreign Legion in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in the 1950s, and his 14,600-odd parachute jumps were recognized as the world record by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parachute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. `` His favorite saying was, ` Only skydivers know why birds sing,''' <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. `` It's the freedom he would feel of leaving the aircraft and being able to fly. That's what he felt.'' For the past 15 years, <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> had been spending a few months each winter in this town of 2,400 people situated about 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` He originally came here because he fell in love with a girl traveling in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> who was from here,'' <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. `` He followed her here. When he arrived she was married to somebody else. He liked the area and the people here, so he just came back every year.'' While in <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON> jumped repeatedly and broke the world record here last year. <PERSON> Charmet </PERSON>'s passion was accuracy jumping, leaving an airplane at 2,500 feet and landing on a 5-centimeter target. `` He'd make like 800 jumps in three months,'' <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. `` He would line up four or five parachutes, pack them all, then make four or five jumps. He would do this all day long.''

<TEXT>
 The Legislature meets in special session Wednesday to debate Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s second plan to overhaul <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s tax system. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who pledged during the 1987 campaign to change the state's populist-based tax system to lighten some of the burden on businesses in order to create jobs, saw his original outline fail before lawmakers in October. Legislators said their chief objection was a proposal to lower the state's $ 75,000 homestead exemption from property taxation to $ 25,000. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has dropped the proposal, conceding it is politically impossible now. `` It's much more of a consensus plan,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said of the revamped proposal. `` The Legislature has been much more intimately involved in this. It's not everything I'd like to have, but I think it's possible to pass.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said his plan would reduce state sales taxes by $ 100 million, increase income taxes by $ 175 million, give businesses a tax break and create a highway, airport and port construction program through a 4-cent excise tax on gasoline. The $ 75 million tax break for businesses would be made up through income tax increases, mostly in the upper-income levels, the governor said. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said the move would help create jobs in a state plagued by unemployment of more than 10 percent and help stabilize state government, which has stumbled through several fiscal crises since the collapse of oil prices and faces a $ 654 million shortfall for the 1989-90 budget year. If the plan receives the necessary two-thirds vote from both chambers, parts of it, such as the income tax increase, still must be approved by the voters on April 29 in the form of a constitutional amendment. Getting voters to back the plan may be the most difficult task, one of <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s legislative floor leaders predicted. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tax-writing committee, said the program may be read by some voters as shifting business taxes `` on the backs of the people.'' `` That's because we've operated so long under the rule of ` Do n't tax you, do n't tax me, tax the man behind the tree. Well, there's no one left behind the tree,'' said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>

 A group of Palestinians attacked and stabbed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier during an army raid in a small <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village late Tuesday, and the wounded soldier opened fire, killing one of his assailants, the army said. Elsewhere in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, army gunfire wounded eight Palestinians on Tuesday, including a 14-year-old hit in his thigh, a 13-year-old shot in the leg and an 18-year-old critically wounded in the shoulder, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. Businesses in the occupied territories remained shut for a third straight day in the longest work stoppage ordered by underground uprising leaders. Observance of the strike was seen as a key test of the strength of pro-PLO leaders of the uprising that began on Dec. 8, 1987. The rebellion has killed 384 Palestinians and 16 Israelis. <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a left-wing legislator, said Tuesday that most Palestinian victims in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were killed during army raids in remote villages and a growing number of the fatalities were teen-agers rather than adults. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said a new Israeli human rights group called Image was formed this week to rouse public awareness of complaints of abuses by soldiers in the territories, which were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` People are ignoring what is happening,'' <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> told a gathering of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. An army spokesman said a band of Palestinians attacked troops making a security sweep on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dis </LOCATION>, a village of 3,000 about three miles east of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and that one of them stabbed and slightly wounded a soldier while `` the others assisted in the attack.'' He said the injured soldier fired on the group, killing one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, and that the others were detained. The spokesman, who remained anonymous under army rules, did not elaborate, and it was not immediately clear whether the victim actually did the stabbing or assisted in it. An official at east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> identified the man as 57-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Rishik </PERSON>, and said he was shot in the heart. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted family members as saying <PERSON> Rishik </PERSON> was shot inside his house by men in civilian clothes. But the army spokesman said he `` definitely participated in the attack.'' <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said a study of the 322 Palestinians the army says were killed in the first 13 months of the uprising showed most <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> victims were from isolated villages rather than refugee camps, often considered hotbeds of anti-Israeli activity. He said the raids are often staged to root out popular committees who declare autonomy from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>'s contentions challenged a key army assertion that soldiers use violence in the occupied territories mainly in response to stoning and firebomb attacks on troops and civilians. An army spokesman said raids in villages were essential to maintaining order on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> highways. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, whose party advocates a separate Palestinian state, urged the army to help prevent shootings by soldiers by giving stiffer punishments to troops convicted of violating open-fire regulations. Also Tuesday, police officials said a Jewish cabbie whose taxi burst into flames in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Feb. 8 was killed by a fire resulting from a technical fault in his vehicle, and not a firebomb attack as earlier believed. Immediately after the death, Jewish settlers stoned Arab-owned cars and injured two Palestinian motorists.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Tuesday targeted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the 12-nation European Community for possible trade sanctions if the countries do not agree to lower trade barriers blocking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales of telecommunications equipment. The decision was announced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who acted after a five-month investigation required under the 1988 Trade Act. The law requires the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open negotiations with countries deemed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials to be blocking sales by American firms of telecommunications equipment. If the talks do n't succeed in removing trade barriers within a year, the law requires the administration to impose trade sanctions. However, the administration has the option of extending the talks for as long as two more years if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe that progress is being made. The announcement said the decision was made by Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> after reviewing comments from industry, labor, other federal agencies, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and foreign governments. `` Criteria for the examination included not only trade barriers, but also each nation's market potential and any measurable progress that it might be making toward -LRB- trade -RRB- liberalization,'' the trade office said in a statement.

 More than 100 Jewish youths, shouting `` Free the Pollards now!,'' took their case Tuesday to the rainy steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where they demanded a re-examination of the sentences and treatment of convicted spy <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> and his wife. `` We will not be silent,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the rally of high school and college students, most of them from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> metropolitan area. Although Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was not in town and no one from his office came outside to meet with the demonstrators, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said, `` I want them to know this issue is not dead.'' <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, 34, was sentenced in April 1987 to life in prison after he was convicted of supplying classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents. His wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON>, 28, was given a five-year sentence as an accessory to her husband's illegal possession of the documents. `` Nothing he turned over to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> damaged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society in any way,'' said <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, comparing <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>'s situation with that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who provided countless <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> are serving life sentences at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. They are eligible to request parole after 10 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, whose sentence made her eligible for parole after 20 months, or last December, was turned down by the parole board last summer, said her father, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. All three had pleaded guilty as part of plea-bargain arrangements. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` The <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case is closed and there is no reason to reopen it. He has attorneys, and if they can make some kind of a legal point, the legal process is open to them.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> Elyakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>, an envoy from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, was meeting this week with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to try to work out an arrangement that would remove the threat of indictment or subpoena from four Israelis connected with the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case.

<HEAD>US: Soviets Left Millions of Mines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet military forces left 10 million to 30 million land mines behind them when they pulled out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, posing a `` tremendous impediment'' to the safe return and resettlement of millions of refugees, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. The official, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnehm </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> affairs, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, operating under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices, has begun a comprehensive program of mine awareness and disposal training for Afghan refugees in camps inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> witness reported, meanwhile, the Soviets have halted air strikes into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from bases inside Soviet territory, ending the largest remaining problem of active warfare in the country. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said also that because the level of human need inside the country is `` enormous,'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` taking a fresh, sympathetic look'' into the possibility of extending humanitarian assistance. He also said _ without offering an explanation _ the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is confident that whatever government emerges in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the aftermath of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` will be neither communist nor messianic Islamic.'' Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs, <PERSON> Gnehm </PERSON> said a 40-person military training team, part of a project dubbed `` Operation Safe Passage,'' has been dispatched to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and will spend six months `` increasing the awareness of large numbers of Afghan refugees of the threats they will face as they return to their homes.'' He said Afghan teams will be trained and given special equipment to `` neutralize and dispose of land mines in their country.'' <PERSON> Gnehm </PERSON> said that training posters have been produced in some of the principal languages of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> which warn: `` Thousands of people have been martyred by mines;'' `` Do n't touch mines, they are deadly'' and, `` All kinds of mines have been placed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gnehm </PERSON> called the training program `` an unprecedented application of special military skills for alleviating suffering from the aftermaths of a terrible and brutal war.'' `` Estimates of the number of mines range from 10 million to 30 million,'' <PERSON> Gnehm </PERSON> said. `` Most of the mines are antipersonnel devices that have been scattered almost indiscriminately.'' Responding to questions, he said that while the Soviets have said they would they were defusing mines and were giving the communist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> maps showing their location, `` to our knowledge neither of these things has happened. He said the locations of the mines would be extremely difficult to map since many of the antipersonnel devices were sewn from planes and helicopters. He said an another danger is posed by the fact that heavy rains have washed some of the explosive devices down from hill and mountainsides into valleys used for farming. <PERSON> Gnehm </PERSON> also reported that since the first flight of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5 cargo plane to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in March 1986, there have been a total of 76 relief flights carrying more than 4.7 million pounds of excess <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> property and privately donated supplies, all intended to aid the refugees. Additionally, he said some 680 injured Afghan citizens have been flown to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to receive medical treatment.

<HEAD>Additional $30 Million Damages Recommended in 1978 Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A retired judge Tuesday recommended a $ 30 million increase in his $ 85.2 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for oil-spill damage from the 1978 wreck of a supertanker off the French coast. The revised award would be shared by the government of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ which would receive the single largest portion, $ 44.4 million _ and some 100 French towns affected by the spill that fouled 100 miles of coastline. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarr </PERSON>, who retired as a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge after his 1988 ruling, continues to serve as special master in the case and made the recommendation after being asked by parties in the case to reconsider the award. The recommendation is subject to approval by another federal judge; no date has been set for a final judgment. Both sides objected to the revised award as well and vowed to appeal. None of the money has been paid. The towns had received $ 7.3 million in the original judgment and sought an additional $ 8 million but received only $ 200,000 more. `` Today's damage determinations continue to support the position the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> parties have maintained throughout: that the claims of damage from this unfortunate incident were exaggerated,'' Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` What we will be asking the appeals court to do is recognize the damage to the environment, the livelihoods of the people in <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION>, and the quality of life,'' said attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingham </PERSON>, who represented the towns, association of oystermen and fishermen, hoteliers, and the two French counties most affected by the spill. `` The judge refused to recognize those damages and he continues to reject them. He simply gave out-of-pocket expenses for the cleanup effort.'' Attorneys for both sides said the revised award totals about $ 115 million _ $ 61 million in damages and between $ 54 million and $ 60 million in interest. The supertanker <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION> ran aground two miles off the Brittany coast. The tanker, which had lost the use of its rudder, had been under tow through the English Channel when the towlines snapped in hurricane-force winds and heavy seas. The tanker lost 68 million gallons of mostly Iranian light crude oil valued at $ 24 million. The spill killed thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures and washing wave after wave of thick black tar along the coast. In 1984, <PERSON> McGarr </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> and two subsidiaries were liable because of negligence in the design, repair and maintenance of the vessel, which was 300 feet wide and longer than three football fields.

 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a little-known Democratic congressman from a conservative district in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, bolted to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday in a move President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed as `` good news for our party.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> easily won election twice as a Democrat, even as his state was moving toward Republican candidates. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is on the move,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> about the switch last week, said before network television cameras. `` The nation, I think, benefits from this.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, leader of House Democrats, said: `` It took me by surprise, but that's everyone's choice. I hope he's happy.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 46, a former banker from the small town of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> in the state's <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, was officially changing his voter registration later in the day. His switch tips the balance in the makeup of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation, leaving it at 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats and breaking the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s long-time majority. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the change `` is good news for our party, not only in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, not only in the South, but nationally.'' Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` I'm frankly not real concerned about it.'' But some other Democrats voiced outrage that <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> would change parties so soon after the election, and Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said finding a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenger would be a top priority for the committee <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, called <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> `` a political opportunist'' who plans to run for statewide office. He said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> should resign and seek his seat again as a Republican. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> supported Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last year and, after appearing at a joint campaign event, `` emphatically requested that he be allowed to have photographs made with Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s change helps the party overcome its embarrassment at the election Saturday of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, to a seat in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Legislature as a Republican. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his stated opposition to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, and that of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, but acknowledged that `` maybe there was some feeling in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, that the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> involving himself in a state legislative election was improper or overkill.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> met with the president Thursday about changing party affiliation and made his decision over the weekend, said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> through mutual political friends, put <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in contact with <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who arranged the meeting with the president. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said his switch `` is not going to change my values, nor will it change the way that I vote.'' `` After a period of prolonged and careful deliberation, I have determined that I can better represent the values and the priorities of north Floridians in the State of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as a Republican,'' he said. Another <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> congressman, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, switched from the Democratic to Republican party four years ago. The most successful of the recent party switchers has been Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who became a Republican in 1982 as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member and later won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike the later <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> defectors, however, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> resigned his seat when he made the switch and then won election to his old seat in the special election that followed. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> served four years in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before winning election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, when 12-term Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>, a Democrat, retired. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> won 51 percent of the vote in a five-candidate primary and had no Republican opponent in the general election. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s 2nd congressional district stretches along the border with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to just west of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and includes <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, the state capital. Last fall, two Republican upsets in races for traditionally Democratic congressional seats eroded the Democrats' majority in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> delegation. At the same time, Republicans picked up one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats with the retirement of Democrat <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> has been active in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and had figured in speculation for a possible run for governor in 1990. He drew publicity last summer for his unsuccessful campaign in support of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> for the Democratic vice presidential nomination. Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s switch `` further proof that we are moving toward majority status.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s decision hardly changes the overall <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> balance, however; <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have a 258-175 advantage, with two vacancies, after the switch.

 For an innocent man, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> spends a lot of time in court. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> carpenter keeps getting stopped for driving on a suspended license because that's what the State Police computer says. `` I'm going nuts. I ca n't take this any more,'' said <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>. A state official promised Tuesday to `` help him all we can,'' and she said she hoped to get the mistake corrected soon. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, a 27-year-old driver with a long record, used <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s stolen license when he was stopped for drunken driving in October, and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s license was suspended because <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> refused a blood-alcohol test, authorities said. As a result, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was cited last month for driving on a suspended license and spent Valentine's Day in court explaining to a judge, who dismissed the charge after being shown a court order expunging <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s record. On Saturday, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, 24, was stopped in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> for driving with a broken tail light, and a computer check revealed the drunken-driving conviction. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> showed newspaper articles about his plight to the police officer, but <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> got a citation anyway. `` I'll have to take off from work again to appear in court, and my boss will probably fire me,'' he said. Police were not sympathetic. `` There's nothing we can do on our end,'' said <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>. `` We put it -LRB- the license -RRB- in the computer and it came back suspended.

She said she was having problems with a new computer system but added, `` I am determined to clear this before I leave today.'' As for <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, he was sentenced Jan. 26 to 7 -LCB- years in prison after his 10th drunken-driving conviction.

<HEAD>Bush Names Career Diplomat to Mexico, Despite Objections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to nominate career diplomat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> as ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the White House announced Tuesday, despite objections in that country. When word spread last month of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intention to nominate <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, a number of prominent Mexicans recommended that their government reject the appointment because of his role in supporting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> served as ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term and later worked as deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> held a friendly meeting after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election last November but the prospective appointment of <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> has still become an issue between the two governments. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>'s strong identification with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy comes against a background of long years of Mexican hostility to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach to that region. The criticism has come from both the right and left. `` National authorities have the right to keep officials who are highly discredited and who have violated human rights from assuming posts in <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> territory,'' said <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest leftist party, also urged <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> to reject the appointment. And a member of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s congressional delegation, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> is an expert in combatting Latin American `` libertarian forces.'' The uproar over <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> prompted the outgoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON>, to predict that relations are `` going to improve further'' because <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> `` has always done his job with efficiency and dedication.'' <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview, `` I am very honored that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nominated me for this extremely important position. If confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, I sincerely hope that during my tenure as ambassador I can make a positive contribution to U.S.-Mexican relations.'' The most difficult issue facing the two countries is how to deal with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 103 billion foreign debt. Another problem is <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s objection to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to dig a ditch near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to reduce border crossings by drug smugglers and illegal immigrants <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, 49, was deputy assistant to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for national security affairs, beginning in 1987, and before that served two years as assistant secretary of state for oceans and environmental and scientific affairs. He was ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from 1981 to 1985. He entered the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 and served in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and as a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> peace talks on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1968-1969.

<TEXT>
 A government regulatory agency concluded Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest futures market, does a poor job of detecting abuses and investigates potential violations sluggishly. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which reviewed the board of trade's performance from July 1987 to April 1988, said the board's routine computer surveillance program was `` not properly tailored to efficiently identify potential trading abuses.'' `` The -LRB- commission staff -RRB- believes that significant modifications to the -LRB- surveillance -RRB- program are necessary for ... an effective ... system,'' the report said. It called on the exchange to expand the number of futures contracts reviewed per month, the amount of trading activity examined each day and the number of traders analyzed. A similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last review of the board of trade in 1986, but received little public attention. However, the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is reviewing evidence from a two-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover investigation of widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is closely scrutinizing both the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets and the commission's oversight of them. The agency's legislative authorization expires Sept. 30 and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may demand reforms before passing it. The commission praised the board of trade on several points, saying it effectively collects information on and monitors general market activity, it thoroughly investigates specific complaints from customers or referrals from other traders and it levies appropriate punishments for violations. However, the agency said `` the exchange did not interview all individuals who might have had knowledge of questionable activity'' and it noted `` undue delays in completing investigations.'' `` The completion of numerous ... investigations was unduly delayed because of the lack of timely supervisory review,'' the report said. In response to the report, board of trade officials noted that the exchange's directors voted earlier this month to spend $ 1 million this year to improve the exchange's computerized trade reconstruction system, which is designed to catch improper trades. Officials estimated then that the system was about 90 percent effective in catching abuses. They said the upgrade would increase the system's effectiveness to 100 percent. They also noted that over the past three years the exchange has expanded its investigative office by 75 percent. `` We are always looking for constructive criticism about our rule enforcement record from the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>,'' Board of Trade President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> report took note of the improvements, but said, `` It is too soon to evaluate the changes.'' Meanwhile, Reps. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., on Tuesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> to delay approving new futures contracts until the completion of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> review of the agency and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>, an aide to English, who is in charge of the committee's review, said the request would affect three active applications for new foreign exchange futures contracts filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday denounced as `` vicious rumor'' allegations against Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> and declared they had been `` gunned down'' by a thorough <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee vote on the embattled nominee was tentatively scheduled for Thursday. Urging the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to move `` forthrightly'' on the nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference that he had personally reviewed portions of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report into Tower's alleged drinking, philandering and financial improprieties. `` What I got from it was that there has been a very unfair treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo, over and over again rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up,'' the president said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, scrutinized the report, which the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> forwarded to committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and ranking Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> late Monday The two senators said in a statement that the committee would meet in a closed session Wednesday and hoped to vote Thursday `` assuming that members of the committee have read and analyzed the latest <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report.'' Asked about the closed committee session, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> later told reporters: `` I want to hear what other people think too. This is a committee decision, not a decision by the chairman or the ranking members. All the members will have access to all the information.'' One Republican on the committee, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said he had reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s findings and saw nothing to disqualify Tower. `` I do not understand the problems that others have, and I hope they will be more specific,'' he said. Another committee <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member, Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, said he read the report and his reaction was `` one of deep, personal anger ... at the system which permitted so many unsubstantiated charges.'' Wallop told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the allegations have proven to be `` unfounded and mean-spirited,'' and said he plans to vote for Tower. And Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said `` we ought to have a unanimous vote'' for Tower. But Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., a prominent conservative, said Tower should withdraw his nomination because he has lost the credibility needed to promote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s defense agenda `` I think <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has a substantial problem,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told reporters. `` I do n't think that has anything to do with who he's sleeping with or whether he has one glass of wine before he goes to bed or two. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the question is whether Tower, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator who once chaired the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, can be credible in dealing with defense contractors after accepting nearly $ 1 million from major weapons manufacturers as a consultant since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, acknowledged in a briefing that policy-making is being undermined because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not been able to assemble his full team of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` I think it is in a way unfortunate that the president does n't have his national security team in place as yet ... Of course, that is a problem in making new policy,'' Scowcroft said. `` But we're moving ahead, and I'm comfortable with that. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, responding to reporters' questions at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` convinced that he -LRB- Tower -RRB- is not only capable of doing this job, but will do it in an outstanding way.'' Published reports have said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> found that Tower drank excessively in the 1970s, but no longer does so. Asked about that, and whether the former senator had undergone treatment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I say there is no evidence of any kind of the disease _ alcoholism. None. None whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the report `` speaks to the fact that a lot of the charges ... I'd say all of these charges that we've read about _ have been rumor, and a lot of it vicious rumor.'' The president said the allegations against Tower `` that have been hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of fact.'' `` I've seen nothing in there that would make me if I was a senator, vote against Senator Tower,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> told reporters he did n't know when the committee would act on the nomination and said the delay in the confirmation proceedings had been `` at the request of the White House.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said he met Monday night with <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, the former arms control chief who in published reports last week was critical of Tower's conduct as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> had expressed an opinion based on facts the committee already had in its possession. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee met Tuesday with former arms control chairman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> as part of the panel's separate inquiry into <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> security clearances. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is planning a closed session Wednesday with <PERSON> Berne </PERSON> <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security officer. <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> had been sent to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1986 to investigate allegations of security breaches in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation while Tower was a member of the contingent. <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> told investigators Sunday that the separate probe had turned up allegations against Tower, said congressional sources, who requested anonymity. At that meeting, the sources said, <PERSON> Indahl </PERSON> corroborated a report that Tower, while in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, had used his secretaries as mistresses. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions that as a senator from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> profited from a lucrative oil investment arranged in 1981 by a <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> lawyer whose son Tower recommended for nomination to the federal bench. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked about the report at his news conference, said, `` I never heard such a report and ... you're telling me something I do n't know anything about.'' A spokesman for Tower on Tuesday denied there had been any `` quid pro quo'' involving the oil investment and the judicial nomination.

 Leading dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was convicted Tuesday for his role in a banned rally and sentenced to nine months in jail in a trial that drew criticism at home, in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and the West. In a six-hour trial, Judge <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlavata </PERSON> found the world-renowned playwright guilty on charges of inciting citizens to take part in banned demonstrations and obstructing police officers. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was taken into custody Jan. 16 after gatherings in central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and his continued incarceration has sparked unprecedented calls for his release at home and abroad. The prosecutor had demanded a one-year sentence for <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and a fine of about $ 2,500. But Ms. <PERSON> Hlavata </PERSON> decreed a nine-month sentence, which <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> appealed, and said no fine was necessary. Each time <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was brought to the courtroom during three breaks in the trial, supporters kept in an adjacent stairwell by police yelled `` Long Live Havel!'' and demanded his freedom. Western reporters outside the courtroom said at least three people were detained. In another courtroom, seven other dissidents face hooliganism charges from their attempt to lay flowers Jan. 16 in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a student who burned himself alive 20 years ago to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. That trial was adjourned until Wednesday. In a closing speech, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> defiantly declared he was not guilty of inciting people to attend a commemoration Jan. 15 for <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> or of ignoring appeals to leave the square the next day. `` I do not feel guilty, but if punished, will accept the sentence as a sacrifice for a good cause, nothing in the light of the ultimate sacrifice of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. He rejected what he said were prosecution attempts to label him `` anti-socialist and anti-state,'' saying these labels have `` lost any semantic meaning'' through overuse. `` In different stages of life, three general secretaries were labeled like this _ <PERSON> Slansky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, referring to former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chiefs <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Slansky </PERSON>, executed after a show trial in the 1950s; current President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who headed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968 but was replaced by <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> in 1969. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement who has spent four years in jail after being convicted of sedition, said the movement always had sought peaceful dialogue with the authorities. `` Warning voices of this kind were not listened to, and today the present power harvests what it has sown, the fruit of its proud attitude,'' he said. Among the two dozen people in the tiny, drab courtroom were <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>; his brother, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dasha </PERSON>. The only journalists were four Czechoslovak reporters, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> reporter and a correspondent from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The family, which has not been allowed to visit <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> in jail, was granted a five-minute chat after sentencing. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said his brother was `` touched by the support'' he has received inside and outside <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Seven witnesses were called, including plainclothes police officer Maj. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zak </PERSON>, who said he had seen <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> around the square before arresting him. The prosecution argued on the charge of obstructing police officers that <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> failed to obey warnings to leave the square. Several hundred had formed there Jan. 16 after the other dissidents were arrested for trying to lay the flowers. Until August, when 10,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on the 20th anniversary of the 1968 invasion, there had been no mass protests in the city for 19 years. Seven of the other dissidents on trial are members of Charter 77 and other independent groups formed in the last year in what activists say is a sign of the increasing dissatisfaction and thirst for reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. An eighth, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>, is hospitalized and will be tried separately. The case against <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> on the incitement charge centered on an appeal broadcast via Western radio stations after he received an anonymous letter on Jan. 9. The letter purported to be from a group of students who said they would use a commemoration for <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> Jan. 15 to repeat his act of self-immolation. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> argued he had a responsibility to dissuade anyone from such an action and said he telephoned the appeal to the Western radio stations after his efforts to get it on Czechoslovak state TV failed. Ms. <PERSON> Hlavata </PERSON> read transcripts from Radio Free Europe and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to support the prosecution case. A crowd of 5,000 people gathered Jan. 15 on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and was broken up by riot police using batons, tear gas, water cannons and dogs. Other demonstrations occurred that week in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> at the same time <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had committed itself to new human rights accords at a <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, whose representatives from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> were denied permission to attend the trial, said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s jailing contravened the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act and the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> accords. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has legalized independent groups, the official Writers' Union protested <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s detention in a public letter. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, more than 2,000 intellectuals, some of them party members, signed a petition calling for his release. The banned, rightist Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> organized a rally that drew about 1,000 people to the main square of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, to hear speeches supporting <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanski </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He said authorities detained four people. The West German government condemned <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s sentencing, saying it violates the spirit of recent human rights accords. Swedish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said in a statement in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> that the sentencing indicates Czechoslovak authorities `` do n't respect the commitments they have made regarding human rights.'' <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyncl </PERSON> of the London-based monthly magazine Index on Censorship said on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Leftist guerrillas attacked the country's most important army base and an engineer detachment Tuesday, killing eight people and wounding 17. The attacks came as representatives of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s major political parties met in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with top commanders of the guerrilla army to discuss a modified insurgent electoral proposal the rebels say could end the war. `` Rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only continue, but will escalate,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s radio. The 9-year-old war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians. The early morning attack on the 4,000-member 1st Brigade's headquarters was the fifth on a major military installation in this capital since November With jurisdiction over the capital and its environs, the brigade headquarters is considered the country's most important military installation. The commander of the 1st army brigade reported no casualties inside the downtown base and that damage was negligible, but he refused to allow journalists inside. The rebels used two pickup trucks fitted with catapults. The detonation of one explosive charge launches the bombs and simultaneously blows up the vehicle. The explosion of one of the vehicles killed <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, about 70 years old, and his wife <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, about 65, who lived in a house near the headquarters. The rebels also attacked the headquarters of the Detachment of Engineers in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Officers there said three soldiers, including a major, were killed at <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>; one civilian and a Civil Defense trooper were killed in fighting nearby. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s body lay on the sidewalk in front of his humble home an hour after the vehicle parked in front of it exploded at 6:20 a.m. Col. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>, commander of the first brigade, said Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, whose legs were blown off by the blast, died on the way to the hospital. He said three people, all civilians were wounded by the explosions. The explosions broke windows, gouged walls and blew doors off hinges in 12 homes. In <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, guerrillas and soldiers battled for three hours before dawn around the engineers' base, according to officials there, including base commander Col. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON>. He said Maj. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> was killed in the fighting. Three other soldiers were reported killed when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the truck in which they were traveling. One civilian and one Civil Defense trooper were killed in a clash in a nearby village. <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON> said 13 soldiers and one civilian were wounded in the fighting. There was no immediate word on guerrilla casualties. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the guerrillas proposed that elections be postponed from March 19 to June and that a cease-fire be insituted. It was a switch from previous demands the election be postponed until September, but left constitutional problems unresolved. The constitution calls for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> to leave office on June 1; right-wing and center political parties have opposed any change in that date and the army has hinted of a coup if <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> overstays. The guerrillas say the parties are hiding behind the constitution because they do n't want to negotiate seriously.

 Israeli-allied militiamen clashed with pro-Syrian Moslem militiamen Tuesday in the first major outbreak of hostilities this year, police said. Also Tuesday, five people were wounded in shelling by Israeli-backed militiamen in a Shiite Moslem village after a guerrilla attack, police reported. They said militiamen of the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proxy militia in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and pro-Syrian Sunni Moslem gunmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> traded artillery in the hilltop <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falous </LOCATION> village south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Police did not have an immediate casualty figure from the Kfar Falous fighting. They said a few shells fell in orange groves in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, inflicting damage but no casualties. <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falous </LOCATION> is the forwardmost position held by the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The two militias have clashed frequently around <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falous </LOCATION> in the last three years, but they have refrained from mounting ground assaults against each other. In the other incident, police said pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalist guerrillas attacked <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> positions in the hilltop villages of <PERSON> Alman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shoumarieh </PERSON> inside the security zone. The guerrillas fired four Katyusha rockets at the two positions, touching off a three-hour clash with machine-gun fire, they said. <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops retaliated by shelling <PERSON> Zawtar </PERSON>, four miles from the southern market town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>. Police said among the casualties were a 54-year-old man and his wife and daughter, who were injured when a mortar round slammed into their house. In another development, a <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> humanitarian organization appealed for the release of doctor Jan Cools, one of its officials who was kidnapped nine months ago. `` We want to appeal to all good forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to help us in our efforts to have Jan Cools released,'' said a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at a news conference in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The organization, known as NORWAC, provides humanitarian and medical support to Palestinians. Cools, 32, a Belgian physician working with <LOCATION> NORWAC </LOCATION>, was abdcuted last May 21 near the southern port city of Tyre after leaving his clinic in the nearby <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp. A group calling itself <ORGANIZATION> Soldiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the abduction. It has not made any demands in return for his release.

<HEAD>Communist Leadership Asking Whether 1950s Political Trials Were Rigged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist leaders have asked historians and jurists to determine whether political trials in the 1950s were rigged, an official said Tuesday. The move could be a step toward rehabilitating leaders of the 1956 anti-communist uprising, some of whom were executed and buried in unmarked graves. The Communist party leadership, on the second and final day of a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, also heard a report on the new constitution, which is to leave out any reference to the leading role of the party and allow a multi-party system. <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON>, secretary of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the party has asked that a panel of legal experts and historians look into the period from 1946 to 1962 to `` expose any possibility of rigged procedures'' at trials conducted during that period. `` In search of a public consensus, we must strive to see that suitable amends are made to those affected within the rehabilitation process,'' <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> told a news conference at the close of the meeting. But he appealed for patience and understanding, saying the historical review would `` take time and we do n't know what the results will be.'' The announcement came less than 10 days after the 108-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> partially reassessed the 1956 revolt. That meeting was provoked by leading reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, who said the revolt that for 32 years was termed a counterrevolution was a popular uprising. The leadership of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' -LRB- communist -RRB- Party reached a compromise formulation saying the revolt had both popular and counterrevolutionary elements The revolt, led by <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> against the regime of the Stalinist <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakosi </PERSON>, started Oct. 23, 1956, and was brought to a bloody end Nov. 4 that year when it was quashed by Soviet troops. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his associates were executed in June 1958. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> decree issued at the time, he and his associates were sentenced to death for `` conspiracy to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Democratic System.'' There have been repeated calls in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for the rehabilitation of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his associates. Authorities announced recently that they would allow their reburial in marked graves. The purpose of the meeting ending Tuesday was to review main concepts in the new constitution that will allow a multi-party system, place greater emphasis on human and civil rights, and strengthen political institutions, including giving the president and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a larger role. <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> presented the main concepts of the new constitution, which is to be adopted next year. `` We do not see the need and sense of the constitutional formulation on the leading role'' of the Communist party, he was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying. However, he added that this `` does not mean that the HSWP -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- renounces the political effort and intention that it wishes to remain the determining factor of the social processes,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said in December that the draft of the new constitution did not contain a reference to the leading role of the party. <PERSON> Fejti </PERSON> said it is necessary to set down in the new law the criteria that groups will be allowed to form if they are `` in harmony with the values and efforts formulated in the constitution.''

<HEAD>Agency Says Too Little Government Focus on Nuclear Weapons Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s master plan for refurbishing its nuclear weapons plants puts too little emphasis on environmental cleanup at the decrepit facilities, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant comptroller general, also raised questions about the department's proposal for building two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium, a perishable gas used in the manufacture of nuclear warheads. The agency, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has prepared more than 50 reports on pollution and operational problems in the weapons industry since 1981 and has been critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s past management of arms plants Peach told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, if carried out, would revitalize the nation's nuclear weapons complex by the year 2010 but would leave key environmental problems unsolved The plan envisions spending at least $ 244 billion over the next 21 years, with $ 32 billion is earmarked for cleaning up environmental damage. `` In our opinion, the plan does not adequately address the cleanup of existing facilities and decontamination of facilities as they are retired from service,'' <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan was endorsed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shortly before he left office. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not said whether he supports it. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s designated energy secretary, has not commented publicly on the modernization report, but he was almost certain to face intense questioning about it at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing Wednesday. Peach, in his testimony, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should closely review the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announced plans to build two new reactors to produce tritium. The department's only existing tritium-producing reactors are shut down because of safety and technical faults, and they are expected to be permanently retired in the 1990s. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to spend $ 6.8 billion to build the two new reactors. Some critics have questioned the need for both reactors, in view of the possibility that future U.S.-Soviet arms control deals could reduce the need for tritium. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the department's acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel the high cost of building the new reactors was justified. `` It is an issue of capacity ... to assure the necessary supplies over the next two decades,'' he said, adding that it would be prudent to have new reactors based on two different technologies in order to guard against possible failures. Peach criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> master plan for failing to spell out how, and over what time period, the environmental damage caused by nuclear weapons production _ such as contaminated soil and groundwater _ could be cleaned up. `` Uncertainty still exists not only regarding the size of the problems but also regarding the extent to which DOE sites can be cleaned up. Some locations may be irreversibly contaminated,'' <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said the master plan calls for spending $ 401 million in the coming budget year on environmental cleanup that eventually will cost up to $ 70 billion. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, including <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, saying it has put more emphasis on nuclear materials production than on safe and environmentally sound operations. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, the department's deputy assistant secretary for environment, said, `` There is no current immediate public health and safety risk'' posed by the weapons plants. He said there would be a threat if the environmental issues were put off. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the department still expected to restart at least one of its tritium-producing reactors, at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, by the end of the year. He said a firm timetable would be available next month.

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the maverick former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief, called himself a close supporter of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies Tuesday as he sought to represent the capital in a new legislative body. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, fired by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in November 1987 after he criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s style of leadership, was one of 10 candidates for nomination to go before an electoral commission of almost 900 members in the chandelier-lit, red-and-white Hall of Columns in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. `` From the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics, I fully support him,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. `` From the viewpoint of the strategy of internal politics, fully. From the viewpoint of tactics, I have my own opinion.'' `` That's only natural,'' he added. The burly, 57-year old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s shock of white hair stood out at the podium and his voice boomed through the hall. The commission is one of the stages set up by a confusing electoral law approved last December. Candidates for a new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies nominated by workers' collectives must pass through the commissions before they are placed on the ballot for the March 26 election The commissions can place all the candidates on the ballot, or limit it to any number. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> gathering met late into the night to choose the slate for a seat in the congress that will represent all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It originally was to consider the candidacies of human rights campaigner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and Politburo member <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, but both pulled out. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> demanded to be considered as a candidate from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON> opted to run in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, a city south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. While one commission met in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, another reviewed a list of candidates for a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> district that included controversial editor <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> of Ogonyok magazine. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who became first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after falling out with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, still has a large following in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Dozens of his supporters held <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s portrait and banners at police barricades around the building, and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s seven-minute address to the electoral commission was interrupted six times by applause. But <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> faced stiff competition from <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, director of the giant ZIL automobile factory, and former cosmonaut <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grechko </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> presented a mainstream program supporting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and focusing on the need for better supplies of food and consumer goods He was nominated by 33 workers' groups compared to 19 for <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. Several <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON> supporters taunted <PERSON> Teltsin </PERSON>, saying they did not want a candidate who was not a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> native. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> built his career in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> before moving to the capital in 1985. Under the election law, candidates may be nominated in more than one geographical area in the initial campaign stages. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> also has been nominated in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> where he could stand a better chance of being elected than in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Until he was removed as a candidate member of the party's ruling Politburo in February 1988, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was one of the staunchest backers of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused him of being overly ambitious and blaming others for his mistakes. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said in his speech that bureaucrats seeking to retain their privileges comprised the biggest danger to reform. He urged that the number of government ministries be cut. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must create a system that will not allow Stalinist abuses in the future. Hospitalized with heart trouble after being dismissed as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said he now was `` physically healthy and ready to fight.''

 Thousands of survivors from the 1984 <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster marched on the capital Tuesday and demanded the reversal of a settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that was less than one-sixth what the government asked for. About 2,500 protesters blocked the road to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which on Feb. 14 instructed <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 470 million as full and final settlement of all claims arising from the leak. The government had asked for $ 3 billion. Placards depicted Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on his knees before a devil throwing a coin. They proclaimed: `` Slave <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Salutes Killer Carbide.'' A spokesman said the protesters made the 16-hour journey by train from <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> `` to seek justice and relief'' for the world's worst industrial disaster, which has killed at least 3,403 people by government count. More than 20,000 people are listed as seriously affected by the leak of methyl isocyanate on Dec. 3, 1984. Deaths attributed to it continue at the rate of at least one a day. More than 500,000 damage claims have been filed. Some of the demonstrators had not eaten since the train journey began Monday afternoon. At least five protesters were admitted to hospitals Tuesday suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion, said V.C. <PERSON> Shukla </PERSON>, a member of Parliament from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Jan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morcha </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party.

The government is working on how to divide the award among those who have claimed damages from the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company whose Indian subsidiary owned the plant. <PERSON> Kaushalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahirwal </PERSON>, a leader of the women's wing of the Welfare for <ORGANIZATION> Bhopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> group, said she did not know the amount but it was `` very little.'' `` My husband is very ill, in hospital. My sister died and my mother is blinded, but we have got no money,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ahirwal </PERSON> said. `` We have been betrayed by the court,'' said <PERSON> Shukla </PERSON>, a former chief minister of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> is located. He said the protesters will march to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and would ask the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the verdict. `` We are outraged that the government should have agreed to the order without consulting even the relief agencies,'' <PERSON> Shukla </PERSON>, the opposition legislator, said. `` After losing four years, what was the sudden hurry to settle for so little?'' Parliament opened a three-month session Tuesday, and President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> made no mention of the Union Carbide settlement in his opening speech.

<TEXT>
 The leaders of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday unexpectedly scheduled an April summit meeting after two days of face-to-face talks failed to resolve differences over nuclear missiles. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> unsuccessfully tried to persuade Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to go forward with the replacement of short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. At the end of the talks with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also confidently predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal of top-ranking diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be `` very successful. The 12 EEC nations decided on the move after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> called for the death of author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of the novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which Moslems believe is blasphemous. During a post-summit news conference, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> faced a round of questions replacing the approximately 600 <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Constancy is a very good factor,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, referring to her government's insistence on replacement of the missiles. `` Constancy and consistency in politics are very strong, very rare, alas all too rare.'' In a joint statement, the two leaders reaffirmed the stance of the March 1988 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, which called for nuclear weapons to be `` kept up to date where necessary.'' They also agreed to meet in April in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Oggersheim </LOCATION> to discuss the missile issue. `` We shall meet again before the next <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit -LRB- in May -RRB- with the objective of making it a success. And I do n't think we can go further than that at present,'' she told more than 150 journalists gathered at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s City Hall. Last week, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> attempted to minimize differences over the missile issue. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wants the decision on replacing the weapons put off until 1991 or 1992, after next year's national elections. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> calls the plan `` modernization,'' but West German officials say it really is the replacement of the aging Lance missiles with new longer-range missiles capable of traveling about 300 miles. The Lance missiles, pointed at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, have a range of nearly 75 miles. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> fears that replacing the missiles could derail efforts to improve East-West relations.

 Two men arrested at the home of black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> appeared in court Tuesday on charges of murder, abduction and assault. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON> were not asked to enter pleas at their arraignment in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> Magistrates Court. Their case was postponed for a week. It is part of a growing scandal surrounding the wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and a group of unofficial bodyguards who lived at her home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the huge township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. In a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television interview broadcast Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> again denied involvement in the murder of 14-year-old activist <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> and accused South African authorities of trying to divide the country's black majority to make it easier to release her husband. `` It would suit the government to release <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to this present situation where he has nowhere to go to in the sense that here he would find a community he led 26 years ago as divided as ever,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the interview was conducted `` within the last 24 hours'' at her home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. `` That it could even be dreamt that I would be responsible for the murder of a child when I have spent all my life fighting against these injustices appalls me,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said police have not so far questioned her about the killing. <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON> was a member and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> described himself as coach of the bodyguards, who called themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club. Anti-government leaders last week accused <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> of waging a `` reign of terror.'' They renounced Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and urged their followers not to associate with her. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON> are accused of helping to beat up four blacks at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home in December. One of them, <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, was found murdered in January. The three surviving young men have implicated the bodyguards in their abduction and also say Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` was involved,'' according to their lawyer. Police raided Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house before dawn Sunday and arrested four men, including <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>. The other two have been released. They reportedly removed a pair of blood-soaked sneakers, a knife, clubs, whips, and a pair of gardening shears. Police also took samples of what state radio reported were bloodstains from the walls of some back rooms where the bodyguards lived. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, has denied being at home when the three men and <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> were brought there. But she has defended their abduction and said they probably were slapped to get them to talk about alleged homosexual activities at the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> residence where they lived. The church denies her allegations. In a related development, a former member of <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has been charged with the killing of another team member. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekaneng </PERSON>, 20, appeared briefly in court Monday but was not requested to enter a plea to a murder charge in the death of <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonda </PERSON>, who was fatally stabbed last week in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ekaneng </PERSON> had a knife wound that stretched from one ear to the other, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. The independent news agency said members of <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> attacked their former colleague and left him for dead, but he survived. Last week, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> followed her husband's instructions and decided to remove the bodyguards from her home. The scandal has damaged the credibility of a woman who was at the forefront of the fight to end white minority rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Her husband, the country's most revered black leader, has been jailed for 37 years of their 40-year marriage. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for plotting to sabotage the government.

<TEXT>
 Seven gun owners assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> prepared Tuesday to ask the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule that state law pre-empts city bans on semiautomatic rifles in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The two cities enacted ordinances this month after a gunman killed five children and wounded 30 other people at a Stockton elementary school on Jan. 17. The gun owners, including two <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> residents and two <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officers, prepared to file suit directly to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because the two cities and other communities that have enacted similar laws are in different state appellate districts, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, assistant general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. The case belongs in the high court because it is of significant statewide importance, <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said. Four of the plaintiffs told a news conference at a <LOCATION> Universal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel that the city ordinances take away rights and instill fear that the bans will lead to action against other types of firearms. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> and the gun owners said that rather than controlling guns, the justice system should deal more strongly with criminals such as the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> gunman, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who killed himself after the schoolyard massacre. `` I'm paying the price that unfortunately the man who committed the crime in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> is not alive to pay,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilburn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> engineer who lives two miles from the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> school. `` Nobody is more outraged about what happened in my hometown.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, 35, complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s action makes him a criminal for owning such weapons <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, an aerospace electronics engineer, said he was interested in target shooting with such guns and he worries the bans will lead to attacks on other civil liberties. `` I'm here because I'm scared to death,'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulombe </PERSON>, a financial consultant in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he works with a youth Explorer group and fears he will no longer be allowed to engage in such activities as firearms instruction, which he says teaches discipline. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> identified the other three plaintiffs as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer, and Sgt. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Salsedo </PERSON> and Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Luczy </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police officers. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials said they will delay any attempts to enforce the ban on possessing the weapons until March 1. Several other proposed gun bans are being considered in various committees of the Legislature. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> counsel asserted that the city bans are really against all semiautomatic rifles. He said the mechanism of the so-called military style assault rifles are the same as other types of semiautomatic rifles. The only real difference, he said, is that the military-style weapons have certain `` external additions'' like bolts on the barrels or attaching bayonets. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> preferred to use the term `` self-loading'' rather than semiautomatic and asserted that semiautomatic weapons that have come into question are not assault rifles. He said only the fully automatic military versions of those guns, which fire repeatedly rather than once with each trigger pull, are assault rifles. `` The whole thing is largely a media creation and needs to be treated as such,'' <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said.

<UNK>Newspaper: East German Border Guards Killed Man In Berlin Wall Escape
Attempt</UNK>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 East German border guards shot and killed a 22-year-old man attempting to flee over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Tuesday. The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> tabloid said a companion was severely wounded when troops fired more than a dozen shots at the pair as they attempted to overcome barriers that divide the city on the night of Feb. 6. A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said witnesses reported hearing about 10 shots fired near the wall that night. Police said the witnesses observed border guards carrying a man to a car and forcing another man to accompany them. The police spokesman said officials could not confirm the witnesses' report. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said communist East German officials denied the reports and contended only a flare was shot into the air, the newspaper said. The newspaper did not give sources for its report, to appear in its Wednesday editions. A copy of the report was telexed to other news media in advance Tuesday night. At least 77 people have been killed trying to escape over communist-built barriers blocking off <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to Working Group August 13. The human rights organization took its name from the day <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> began building the wall Aug. 13, 1961.

 A former teacher who admitted molesting boys as young as age 8 while he worked at a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> school told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday he was surprised it took authorities so long to stop him. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who is serving the third year of a 10-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation, said in the videotaped testimony he molested at least 25 students over the 14 years he taught at the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Price said his victims were primarily boys aged 8 through 12. `` One, that was the age group I was teaching. And, secondly, I'm sure that there was the possibility that younger children do n't generally tell things, as the older children do,'' he said under questioning by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballen </PERSON>, chief counsel to a special investigative unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Price has been a prisoner at the <ORGANIZATION> Butner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, since 1986. The testimony came in the third week of hearings by the committee, which has been looking into various alleged misdeeds on Indian reservations, within the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> and among other agencies that do business with Indians. After hearing testimony on contracting irregularities and organized crime involvement in Indian gaming operations, the committee is now concentrating on the problem of child sex abuse on reservations. Price told <PERSON> Ballen </PERSON> he was surprised that he could continue his activity on and off for 14 years. `` This is strictly hindsight,'' Price said. `` Looking back it certainly is a phenomenon that is hard to understand.'' In 1974, as a provision for receiving federal aid, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required the states to enact laws mandating that individuals who suspect sexual abuse in a school report it to the authorities. But there is no such federal law and state statutes do not apply to Indian reservations and BIA schools. Two teachers testified that they knew or heard rumors of Price's activities, but despite complaints to school authorities, nothing was done until the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began its investigation in 1985 following a mother's complaint The mother, <PERSON> Keneithea </PERSON> <PERSON> Haigler </PERSON>, said that when she told the school superintendent that her 8-year-old son had been molested by Price, `` they let me know that they knew what this teacher was doing and they were just waiting for some mother to come in and do something about it.'' Another mother, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tramper </PERSON>, said Price threatened the boys if they discussed the matter with their parents. Price, who was unemotional during his taped interview, said at its close that he believes he always wanted to get caught because he could not stop himself from his activities. `` I've had time, of course, in prison to reflect over this and te seriousness of it,'' he said. `` Fondling is, you know, in my mind, I was thinking, it really does n't hurt anybody. But I know now how much it does hurt,'' he said. `` We just must find a way to help the children first _ and of course the molesters also _ above all, the children, who really do n't know what they're getting into,'' he said, telling the panel that he himself had been molested at the age of 8. Later, witnesses from the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> said that despite a new policy requiring school personnel to report cases of sex abuse, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> does not get much information. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehojah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> branch chief for Indian elementary and secondary school programs, said no disciplinary action has ever been taken for failure to report. <PERSON> Mehojah </PERSON> and the others advocated enactment of a federal law similar to those in the states, making failure to report alleged sex abuse a crime. The opinion was echoed by two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who investigate crime on Indian reservations in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, and law enforcement officials working for the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> and local authorities. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> said interviews with pedophiles have indicated that child molesters gravitate to Indian reservations because there is little supervision and they usually are in remote areas, making it easy to prey on children. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, general chairman of the Indian law enforcement section of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said investigation of child abuse cases are sometimes hampered by tribes which refuse to let the children off the reservation to testify. <PERSON> Mehojah </PERSON> said many teachers have gone to work before background checks were complete because of paperwork delays.

 A former education adviser to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was sentenced Tuesday to a seven - to 10-year state prison term on an array of corruption charges, or three years on top of his current federal prison term Allowing for early release, the judge who sentenced <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> said he anticipated the former <ORGANIZATION> Bridgewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> president would spend 2 -LCB- years behind bars on the federal and state charges, then serve a lengthy probation. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> administered an adult education program designed to help immigrants and the illiterate. He was considered the mastermind of a plan that involved paying inflated classroom rent and receiving some of the money back, taking the salaries of fictitious employees and skimming funds intended to pay for classroom renovations. Led into court in handcuffs, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> pleaded guilty to eight counts of forgery, larceny, conflict of interest, filing a false income tax return and lying to the state. Under a plea bargain arrangement, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> was spared a trial and 33 other counts were placed on file. Under <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law, the state reserves the right to prosecute those charges at a later date. On the two forgery counts, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> imposed a sentence of 7 to 10 years in the maximum-security prison in <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION>, with three years to be served, after <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> finishes the federal term. Under state law, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> would be eligible for parole after one year. On the other six counts he pleaded guilty to, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> received concurrent sentences that would have totaled 18 to 25 -LCB- years if imposed consecutively. The 42-year-old <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> resident is serving his federal prison term in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, called the sentence `` severe'' for a public official who `` made a few mistakes,'' but he did not say whether he would appeal. As a special assistant to the governor, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> is the highest-ranking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration official to face criminal charges. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has publicly condemned <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s actions and said his administration cooperated in the state and federal investigations. Last July, <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> was sentenced to 2 -LCB- years in prison after pleading guilty in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to five charges of conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion in a scheme involving his brother and two other men to skim more than $ 80,000 from the adult education program funded by the federal government and run by the state. His case centered on activities that began between 1979 and early 1983. He was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' education adviser from February 1983 to September 1986.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will send $ 20 million worth of military equipment in the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> since the 1982 Falklands conflict, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> said the equipment included spare parts for about 20 helicopters and 200 armored personnel carriers. The deal was signed Tuesday by Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s army chief Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Gassino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> did not return phone calls for comment. The aid is the first since <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> clashed in 1982 over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> islands that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> owns and calls the <LOCATION> Falklands </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims and calls the Malvinas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the conflict. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s military budget has been cut in half to about 2 percent of the gross domestic product since civilian President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office in December 1983, ending a military regime that had been in power for nearly eight years. Officers have complained about not having enough money to draft and train recruits, fly jets or buy the parts needed to keep foreign-made equipment running, including M-113 armored personnel carriers and Bell helicopters. The lack of equipment and the low military budget in general was one of the reasons cited by army rebels for an insurrection last December. Defense Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaunarena </PERSON> personally requested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance on a trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last October during which he met with then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> was sharply restricted beginning in the late 1970s because of human rights violations committed by the military regime trying to eradicate subversion. The juntas bought the guns, planes and ships they wanted from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> suppliers.

<HEAD>New Paraguan Leader Vows To Fight Drug Trafficking, Congressman Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The new leader of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> has promised to help fight drug trafficking and cooperate in hunting Nazi war criminals who may be hiding in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation, the first congressman to visit <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since the coup said Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., said Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told him during an hour-long meeting last week that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> `` wants to change the reputation of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> as a refuge for thieves and scoundrels to a very different, more positive place. `` In our conversation, the provisional president was very specific. He even assured me that he is willing to receive requests from those who hunt war criminals, because he wants to end <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s historic reputation as a haven for ex-Nazis, drug dealers and Third World dictators,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. The congressman said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> also promised to help fight drug trafficking. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> is known as a key money-laundering center for cocaine profits and there have been reports that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> received some of the profits. But <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who later in the day briefed <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on his visit, cautioned that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should `` base its policies toward <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on future actions,'' not promises. `` I'm not in any position to make a judgement about what's inside his head. I think we have to judge him by the actions he takes,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` There have been steps, and they're not insigificant.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a coup Feb. 3. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> came to power in a 1954 coup and used torture to repress political opposition in his early years of power. Later, he eased up on the most blatant human rights violations, relying on harassment, detentions and explusions. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> already has vowed to respect human rights and pledged to respect freedom of the press. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color, a prominent investigative newspaper shut down for nearly five years, has been allowed to reopen. But many are skeptical about how far reform will go under <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who until recently was an ally of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and who does not consider the former president a dictator. This week, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said elections will be held May 1 despite a request by the opposition to delay them. Opposition party leaders, who had little chance under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s election rules, wanted more time to organize. They are considering an election boycott. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the quick election in the wake of the coup `` is clearly favoring the -LRB- majority -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> -RRB- over the opposition. ... But there are many people who would say that even a signficant delay of several months would n't be likely to allow the opposition to overcome the problem of years and years of being out of power.

<HEAD>Southern Province Said On Verge Of General Strike Over Ethnic Conflict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of ethnic Albanians stopped work or went on a hunger strike in troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province Tuesday, protesting alleged anti-Albanian policies, official media and sources said. Official sources interviewed by telephone in the regional capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the southern province is `` on the verge of a general strike.'' Also Tuesday, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported a police official beat up a journalist who wrote about alleged corruption, one of a string of recent attacks on Yugoslav reporters. The protest in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> was triggered by a hunger strike of more than 1,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> miners who refused to leave their pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> lead and zinc mine. The miners allege discrimination by communist authorities in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, of which <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is an adminstrative part. Thousands of other ethnic Albanians in the economically depressed province walked off their jobs in other <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> towns Tuesday in support of the miners' demands that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chiefs of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, come to talk with them, media reports said. The Trepca miners near <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>, 125 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, protested the official Serbian policy that labeled them `` demonstrators, nationalist and separatists'' when they took to the streets last November, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Medical teams were sent to the <LOCATION> Trepca </LOCATION> mines where some of the protesters have refused to take water and food for the past 24 hours. The provincial communist leadership has opened an emergency session to discuss the labor unrest, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Although ventilation in the shafts is being maintained, the potential danger of an accident in the mine is very real,'' <PERSON> Agim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajrami </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> employee, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, adding that the miners had sealed off all the pit entrances not allowing anybody in. The ambitious Serbian party leader, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, has been seeking to curtail the autonomy of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which won broad independence from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> by the current <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> constitution adopted in 1974. Serbian leaders want more control in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to protect the Slav population allegedly persecuted by the ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of the province's population. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> miners marched to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> to protest the dismissal of some top provincial officials as demanded by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leaders and were joined by up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians In the southern republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, reporter <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brkic </PERSON> was assaulted Monday in the police headquarters in the capital <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Ratko </PERSON> <PERSON> Micunovic </PERSON>, a department head of the state security police, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Brkic </PERSON>, who had published a story claiming <PERSON> Micunovic </PERSON> and other state security officials were corrupt, lodged a formal complaint and was assaulted again by a group of unindentified thugs waiting outside, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of severe head and other injuries. Police said <PERSON> Micunovic </PERSON> was suspended from duty pending an investigation, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. Last week, a woman television reporter was beaten up by an unindentified attacker who first vilified her for a recent program in which she presented the Albanian viewpoint in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Last month, a police cordon prevented several dozen rowdies from breaking into the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> offices of the <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> Vjesnik daily, angry about allegedly critical stories about <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s policies in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday accused <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> of `` outrageous'' behavior and said relations could be damaged over the alleged manhandling of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador by Romanian militiamen last month. Romanian Ambassador <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Soare </PERSON> rejected the British account of the Jan. 27 incident during a frosty 30-minute interview with Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Angry <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> thrust lances and machetes at government electric power officials Tuesday in a second day of heated debate over a proposed hydroelectric dam that would flood tribal lands. More than 500 Indians from 37 native groups packed the city's community center for the historic encounter of tribes in this east <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> city, 2,000 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> The meeting is the first united political movement by the native tribes, and seeks to block construction of the <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION> dam on the <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tributary. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> says the energy is vital for development in this land of 144 million people. Tempers flared when <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>, engineering director for Eletronorte, the government <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> power company, told the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> the dam would not raise the river beyond its present level. `` You're lying! Everything you say is a lie!'' shouted Tuira, a <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> woman as she strode through the crowd and brandished a machete in <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON>' face. Her words in <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> were translated into broken <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> by Chief <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON>. He said her gesture is `` one of our traditions, it does not mean war.'' <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> warrior Uh-Te also protested angrily and repeatedly thrust a red-feathered lance at the company offical. `` We do n't know what energy means. I was raised on game, fish and wild honey in the forest. Why did n't you consult us about the dam?'' said Uh-Te with <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON> translating. The Indians, some wearing a green-and-yellow feathered headresses and black warpaint on their faces and bodies, raised their war clubs in a sign of agreement. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> said Eletronorte was preparing an environmental impact report on the <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION> project. `` If the dam affects Indian land, it must be approved by congress,'' he said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Indian population has been decimated by development projects such as hydroelectric dams and the Trans-Amazon highway. There are about 220,000 Indians left in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, down from an estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> explorers in 1500. `` The dam is not a reality until construction starts,'' and that wo n't happen for at least five years,'' <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> said. He said Eletronorte has scrapped plans for other contested <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> dams at <LOCATION> Babaquara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iriri </LOCATION>. Chief <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON> also complained that Indians had not been consulted about the name of the dam. <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION> is a <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> war cry, he said. `` To our youths, the government is calling us to war,'' <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> promised the project would be given a `` white name.'' Earlier in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, Interior Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> said the government would not consider stopping the Kararao project. He said the dam was fundamental for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s future and would dislocate only about 280 Indians. <PERSON> Kararao </PERSON> will generate 11 million kilowatts of electricity, <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> said _ second only to the Itaipu dam, the world's largest, located on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s southwestern border with <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Brazilian and international environmental groups attending the five-day meeting said the Kararao project was probably unstoppable. `` I do n't think it's likely they'll stop construction of <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION>. But that does n't mean the meeting is a waste,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramble </PERSON>, a director of the Washington-based National Wildlife Fund. `` This could be a real milestone in the formation of alliances among Amazonian peoples to work together to save the place they live in.'' Joining the protesters was British rock star Sting, who told the <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chiefs </ORGANIZATION> he was starting an international campaign to raise money to create a huge <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. He said the campaign would begin April 12 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` I'm not here on behalf of one people. If the rain forest dies all of us are in danger,'' Sting said. He said he got permission for his project from President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 More than 50 people were injured Tuesday in a clash by rival workers in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> over resumption of work at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest shipyard, news reports said. The national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said fights broke out when about 1,500 pro-management workers stopped about 1,000 militant unionists from obstructing operations at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Labor disputes over wages have crippled shipyard operations since December In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, riot police dispersed about 1,000 subway workers who rallied in a downtown plaza, protesting that management suppressed free labor union movements. No injuries or arrests were reported. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report meanwhile said Tuesday that the gulf between labor and management over wages will lead to more and longer disputes this year. The report, submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said 116 labor disputes have taken place so far this year, compared to 88 during the same period last year, and the average duration of disputes increased from five days to 10. On the political side, radical students threw hundreds of firebombs and attacked riot police with clubs and steel bars Tuesday at an anti-government, anti-U.S. rally in this capital city. The number of injured was not reported. About 300 students shouting `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' and `` Overthrow -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' fought police for an hour in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. Students attacked police with rocks and clubs and police fought back, also throwing rocks and swinging clubs. The protest came four days before the first anniversary of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and less than a week before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit. The government has warned that violence will not be tolerated and protesters will be harshly punished. Student radicals, a small but vocal minority on campus, have little support.

<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas on Tuesday killed one soldier and wounded three, police said, in the outskirts of this Andean city where the prime minister urged residents to ignore a guerrilla strike call. Police said the guerrillas buried explosives on a road in northern <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> and exploded the charge as the soldiers passed in a troop truck. Elsewhere, rebels Monday fatally stabbed four women and two men in <LOCATION> Huichinga </LOCATION>, a hamlet 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, in retaliation for selling cattle to the government, police said. `` We can not permit the threat of violence to paralyze a city,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>. He promised police protection from the guerrillas, who threatened reprisal for those not following their weeklong strike announced Monday. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter on the scene said most business were closed early Tuesday but began reopening during <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>'s visit. A similar strike called in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, whose stronghold is the <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> region, paralyzed <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> for a week. More than 12,000 people have been killed in the Shining Path guerrilla group's 9-year-old insurgency, which has increasingly been oriented toward disrupting <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s fragile economy.

And <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> espouses unorthodox methods of restoring the stature of unions in the workplace, including the schools where his members teach. Among his proposed changes in the education system are abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and placing its duties in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, firing incompetent teachers and transforming high schools into campuslike environments where students have some flexibility in choosing classes. `` In this country we go on the pendulum swing system,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said Tuesday during a breakfast meeting with reporters covering the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Council meeting here. `` First we had tough schools with rigorous standards where most kids are pushed out. Then we move to soft schools where everybody graduates but very few learn anything. `` Now we go back to the other way,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. `` It's pretty clear that if you have two ways of doing things and neither is working it's time to find a third way.'' That third way, in <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s view, might include ideas unions have traditionally opposed, including the use of part-time teachers. A shortage of qualified math and science teachers has made the use of part-timers a viable approach that labor should support although those teachers are unlikely to join the union, <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. `` We have to encourage non-traditional methods,'' said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, who has been president of the 690,000-member AFT since 1974. He carries that approach over to overall union organizing, a once-militant union leader calling on his colleagues to relax the standards he says are partly to blame for the declining share of unionized workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Unions themselves have not adequately recongnized the changing of the labor force,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. `` It's the failure in many cases to switch the nature of your appeal fast enough.'' As the demographics of the workforce change to include fewer workers in high-risk factory jobs and more in white-collar professions, unions must change equally fast to appeal to professionals, <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. Included in those changes, he said, should be new membership categories such as associate memberships that would offer workers who are not members of a collective bargaining unit some union services. That concept is the subject of a heated internal debate that delayed the scheduled release this week of a major report on labor organizing. Hard-liners object to the concept of associate memberships on grounds that labor is conceding too much in its drive to fill up membership rolls. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> will get a chance to discuss his proposal to merge the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> departments with Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on Wednesday, when they visit a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school that is part of a highly successful pilot program that gives teachers a say in school budgets and management. `` I think we have to treat these kids as though they are workers,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. `` We need to create the perception that school is a good place for them.''

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Calls On Bulgaria to Improve Human Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the Bulgarian government Tuesday for information about ethnic Turks imprisoned mainly for peacefully opposing a forced assimilation campaign. The London-based human rights group said some members of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s Turkish minority have been jailed on terrorism or espionage charges for protesting a name-changing policy which took effect four years ago, and some have been tortured. Many were among hundreds arrested in 1984 and early 1985 for resisting or protesting the assimilation campaign, which restricted language and religion and forced Turks to give up their Islamic names. `` The Bulgarian authorities have charged many with criminal charges like ` terrorism' or ` hooliganism' but <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> believes that the real reason for their imprisonment may be their non-violent opposition to the assimilation campaign,'' the report said. In addition, an increase in independent human rights activities in the past year has been followed by a crackdown on activists, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> warned in a report. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> ratified in 1970 the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees free expression, association and movement. `` Amnesty International is calling on the government to end violations of these basic rights,'' it said in the report. The group seeks information on more than 150 prisoners, mostly from the 900,000-strong ethnic Turkish minority which makes up about 10 percent of the population, said the report. Since 1984, the Bulgarian government has denied that a Turkish minority exists in the country. It also says there are no human rights abuses. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasanov </PERSON> <PERSON> Aptullov </PERSON>, a 29-year-old philosophy lecturer from <ORGANIZATION> Sofia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and three others were arrested after producing leaflets in 1986 rallying Turks to oppose the assimilation, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. They were imprisoned for eight to 10 years each. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> considers them prisoners of conscience, the human rights group's term for people who use non-violent means to express themselves. The report described in detail the cases of 11 prisoners of conscience, and said <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> seeks information on another 144 prisoners. The group said another prisoner of conscience, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehmedov </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyuseinov </PERSON>, was arrested in 1985 for refusing to accept his new name and applying to emigrate to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He was badly beaten in prison but released to internal exile after losing 88 pounds on a hunger strike. The government said he was freed in 1987, but <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it has been told he remains in exile in northwest <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Other prisoners have been tortured by prolonged beating on the soles of the feet, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it has long been concerned about prisoners of conscience in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, and welcomed the recent dialogue begun with the Bulgarian government. It said Bulgarian authorities supplied information in 1987 after repeated requests by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The group met with some officials, including a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, in 1988. The report said concerns remain and reliable information has been scarce because of censorship and contradictory official statements. Name changes have made identification difficult.

<TEXT>
 A bomb exploded Tuesday inside a restaurant in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, killing four people, and a shopkeeper was shot and killed as Sinhalese extremists protesting last week's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> election tried to force a strike Police and military officials said extremists set fire to 10 government-owned buses and hurled smoke bombs in and around the capital. The government declared a security alert and appealed to residents not to give in to the threats by the extremists, state-run radio reported. Most shops owned by Sinhalese, the island's majority ethnic group, stayed open, but many Tamil and Moslem shopkeepers heeded warnings issued by the extremists and kept their establishments shuttered. A bomb concealed in a bag exploded inside the restaurant at <LOCATION> Narahenpitiya </LOCATION>, about four miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> city center, killing four people and injuring eight others. A Sinhalese cashier who did not heed the strike call and kept his store open was shot and killed in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The deaths were blamed on the radical Sinhalese group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Police and military officials said the front, which has been waging a campaign of assassinations and intimidation against the government, had distributed leaflets calling for the strike to protest the Feb. 15 Parliament election. The front had vowed to disrupt the election, which gave President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 125 of 225 seats. More than 1,000 people were killed during the five-week campaign. Police blamed most of the slayings on the front and said others were the work of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, a Tamil separatist group that also had vowed to disrupt the election. More than 10,000 people have died in ethnic violence since the Tamil insurrection started in 1983.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, preparing Tuesday to visit <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, defended <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s right to invest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> despite indications that many Americans consider <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> a greater threat than the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s military power. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, said the president intends to use his five-day trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that starts Wednesday to underscore `` that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> power.'' Brushing aside a suggestion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking off on his first overseas voyage before he has put in place a cohesive foreign policy, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said the president `` is not trying to make quick headlines'' but instead wants to shape policies that `` will aid us in where we think we'd like to be at the end of the century.'' <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> made public an ambitious agenda of a dozen 15-30 minute meetings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and kings, presidents and prime ministers from around the world who will join in attending the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who died Jan. 7. More than 150 countries will be represented at the funeral. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked at a news conference how he would reassure Americans who think the Japanese `` are buying and are owning too much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy,'' pointed out that Japanese investment in this country ranks third behind that of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he reassures worried Americans by telling them `` that it is important if we believe in open markets that people be allowed to invest here, just as I'd like to see more openness for American investors in other countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds helped this country's finances. `` We have horrendous deficits and foreign capital joins domestic capital in financing those deficits,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must do more to remove barriers in foreign markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods.'' A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll published Tuesday said that more than 40 percent of those who responded in the telephone survey of 1,512 adults said they saw <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic power a greater threat than the Soviets' military power. Scowcroft said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will take advantage of the presence of over 60 heads of government or state to hold discussions with as many as time permits.'' He ticked off scheduled meetings with the leaders of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, and said more may be added. Many of those countries have pressing problems _ the Brazilian economy, for example, is strained by debts owed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and the Japanese. Scowcroft did not predict any agreements as a result of the talks, but he said the mere act of personal contact at the top could ease the way for future agreements. `` What I'd like to underscore is the importance here, not with how long the meets necessarily are and how much substance, but the significance of a face-to-face opportunity to get, at least, out on the table a few issues for discussion,'' he said. `` That's very, very important and it eases the sense of communication between countries after that if you've had this kind of personal contact.''

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airman was being questioned Wednesday in connection with the air gun shooting of a South Korean citizen near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base, the third incident involving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen in the same area, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>, a provincial port city about 130 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was being held for investigation in the case. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is with the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> and is stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Kunsan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. No hometown was available. Newspapers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun-ho </PERSON>, 33, a farmer, as claiming <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> fired at him Monday when he shouted and gestured to prevent the airman from aiming his gun at two women passers-by. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was wounded slightly in the thigh, newspapers said. `` The latest incident came as anti-American sentiment is running high,'' said Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. An investigation was still under way in the involvement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen in two apparently unrelated deaths of Korean citizens last week. Those deaths brought violent anti-American protests and the city was placed off limits to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said restrictions were lifted Tuesday, but a midnight weekday curfew was imposed for the 3,500 military personnel stationed at <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION> Air Base. On Feb. 11, a mushroom grower, <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan-yong </PERSON>, 54, died after an altercation in a residential area of <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>. Police said Air Force Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harayda </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was being questioned.

<HEAD>Conspirator Says Move Was Planned Against Marcos In December 1985</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Military officers plotted for months to oust President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and sped up their plans after the public was angered by cheating in the 1986 election against <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, a leading conspirator said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said reform-minded officers initially planned to establish a transitional council to run the country until new elections could be held. Later, they threw their support to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. In an interview with radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said the Reform the Armed Forces Movement planned to move against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in December 1985 but postponed their move after he called a `` snap'' election for the following February. `` So we decided to postpone until sometime after elections, around April or May in the summer,'' <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said. `` When there was a backlash -LRB- against -RRB- cheating in the elections, we accelerated it.'' <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> made the remarks on the third anniversary of a military mutiny, when officers led by then-Defense Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and then-Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> announced they were breaking with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. That triggered a massive popular uprising, during which hundreds of thousands of civilians poured into the streets to defend the mutineers against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' troops. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> three days later for exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> declared their support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Both she and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed victory in the elections of Feb. 7, 1986, which the Roman Catholic hierachy and foreign observers said were marked by unprecedented fraud. `` Our plan was if we succeeded in ousting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or asking him to step down, we would set up a transition council, either five to seven members,'' <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said. `` Our agreement was whoever joined the transition council would not run in the election which we would hold because it would be unfair.'' <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> did not explain why the officers dropped the transitional council in favor of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The reform movement included former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, sought in the violent August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Movement members frequently have complained that they were never given credit for their role in ousting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. In the interview, <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> found out about the plot but was uncertain when it was to be launched. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said the conspirators leaked a series of possible dates to confuse <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters and force them into a series of security alerts

 Newly elected state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s opponent filed a court motion Tuesday seeking to block the former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> grand wizard from taking the legislative seat he won last Saturday The motion filed by homebuilder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> asks that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s candidacy be declared illegal because he lives outside the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> district that elected him State law requires a one-year district residency by candidates. District Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said he was studying the request and probably would decide the matter Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said late Tuesday that he met the residency requirements `` in every respect. It's a frivolous challenge.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> has said he has proof he lived in the district, a nearly all-white bedroom community of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Earlier Tuesday, state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislative leaders said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> probably would be accepted by Republicans as one of their own if he's seated in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when it convenes for a special session Wednesday. A freshman independent had said he would raise the residency issue, but Democrats and Republicans alike had said they did n't expect the move to succeed. Both <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> ran as Republicans. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>'s motion, filed along with a district resident, asks that <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> be declared the winner. According to the motion, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> listed a home address outside the district when he qualified as a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary candidate for president on Jan. 15, 1988, and for state primaries. The motion also asked for a temporary restraining order forbidding the secretary of state from certifying <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> as the winner until <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> decides whether <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> fulfilled the residency requirements. However, the secretary of state's office certified the results Tuesday after Jefferson Parish Registrar <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Altobello </PERSON> officially counted the votes from Saturday's race and found <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s 227-vote margin of victory intact. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> gave the thumbs up and smiled broadly Tuesday at the announcement. `` I'm just really proud to live in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` I'm also looking forward to an end to the hoopla `` I'm anxious to meet with the legislators,'' he said. `` I have a lot to learn.'' If the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> lets him in, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> will be one of 18 Republicans in the 105-member House. There are six Republicans in the 39-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Also Tuesday, Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> softened his aggressive campaign to drive <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> from the party, saying he feared such a public forum might be exactly what the man wanted. Republican legislators Tuesday said they saw no reason to reject <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> from the caucus despite <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s repudiation of him as a `` charlatan.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> convenes in special session Wednesday to take up tax issues. Rep. <PERSON> Odon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacque </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> said Monday he intended to challenge <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> on grounds that he did not live in his district for the required year. `` We will see if Mr. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is what he says he is or what the media says he is,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Peppi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruneau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucus chairman. `` If he's what he says he is, he has no problem. He got to the House the same way everybody else did.'' There is at least one precedent for a state legislature refusing to seat a member because of his views, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Governments. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was barred from taking a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in January 1966 because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in December 1966 said <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> had to be seated since the only issue was his political views. Both President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> in the runoff election. After <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> won, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> vowed to have <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> censured and barred from using the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> name. A resolution is expected to be adopted by the party's 11-member executive council, which will confer by telephone Friday. At a brief news conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded his involvement might have been viewed by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> voters as `` improper or overkill.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, registered as a Republican days before filing as a candidate. He left the Klan in 1980 but remains the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he describes as a civil rights group for everyone. I'm certainly not the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> I was during my years in the Klan but I'm certain I've grown like all people do, mentally, spiritually,'' he said at a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. `` I believe in the civil rights of all people. I think the criticism I've endured will be muted by my activities in the House of Representatives.'' `` We ca n't be responsible for what he did before he was registered as a Republican,'' said Rep. Art Sour, a Republican. `` I do n't understand what <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is talking about. Censure him for what? The only control we have over him is what he's done since he's been a Republican. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, legislative party leader, said he hoped <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> would be seated without problems. `` If anyone wanted to challenge <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> they should have done so when he qualified as a candidate,'' he said.

Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he would like the music folks back in the Big Apple at least every other year. `` What we tried to do was turn a one-night event into a four or five evening event, to encourage people to come to the city,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the 1988 Grammy Awards. `` There is a lot of prestige, but you certainly can not ignore the financial aspect,'' said <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Loew </PERSON>'s Hotels. He estimated Grammy visitors and the television show brought about $ 40 million to the city. `` There were some very interesting and culturally lifting moments, and that was one of the things that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> really provided. It makes the nominees feel really special,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said recently. For the first time, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has countered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s hospitality with its own friendship campaign, consisting of several events revolving around Wednesday's awards ceremony This year's three-hour awards show will be broadcast live on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> beginning at 8 p.m. EST. Top nominees include folk singer <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> with six nominations and jazz vocalist <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> with five. The show's host will be comedian <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>. The awards are voted by the Los Angeles-based academy's 6,000 members for the best musical performances and songwriting. This is the 31st year for the awards, and the show has been held in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> every year except five. This year, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Welcomes The Grammy Awards Committee, a panel of business leaders selected by Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, is overseeing receptions and making sure the Grammy folks are welcome in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It's the same formula used by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> to attract the Olympics to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1984. `` What we see is a foundation for building a longer-term relationship,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, executive director of the Grammy committee, which has raised $ 200,000 from businesses to pay several events. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the academy's directors decide where to hold the awards ceremony, and none of the possible host cities have a chance to make bids. The committee's events included a Grammys In The Schools program held Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where a music academy attracts students from all over the 300-square-mile <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> school district. Performers included composer-conductor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, jazz drummer <PERSON> Stix </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON> and `` Tonight Show'' saxophonist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Christlieb </PERSON>. A Grammy Night On The Town on Sunday showcased jazz in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, with performances throughout the city by <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his trio, trumpeter <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, singer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstine </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Messengers </ORGANIZATION>. During a gala reception Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Gene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, the music academy's President's Award was given to <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the host committee, representing the city but not funded by it, made political sense. `` An activity like the committee ... most people would not consider that to be an appropriate public funds expenditure,'' he said. `` But bringing together the civic leadership of this city to do something like this is highly appropriate.'' No matter what <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> does to make the Grammy guests and show feel welcome in the city, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> has made it clear he is ambivalent about where the show should be held. `` As far as the show itself, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are each centers of music, centers of culture,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have a problem booking the show at either location.''

 A university employee was killed in battles between police and students protesting government austerity measures and the purported police slaying of a student, newspapers said Tuesday. More street violence Tuesday was reported by the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Student leaders from <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> told reporters they were protesting an economic reform package announced by the government that eliminated subsidized prices on most goods. They also complained that an engineering student died at the hands of local police and that a vagrancy law allowed police to detain and jail people without trial for periods that could run into years. The students said law authorities vowed to apply the vagrancy law more forcefully to keep criminals off the streets. The student leaders told reporters that a university employee, whom they identified as <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Yepez </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, was killed in cross fire by a bullet fired by police in battles with students Monday night. No reports emerged of other injuries and no confirmation or denial of the employee's death came from police sources. Student leaders said they expected the riots to continue and that they planned a joint march with students from across the country.

 Rescuers used a helicopter, bulldozers and bridge-building equipment in an unsuccessful search Tuesday for the eight people aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cargo plane that crashed and burned in a swamp. An officer who waded through 5-foot-deep water to reach the site said no bodies were found and it was unlikely anyone could have survived. `` From the looks of it, that's the conclusion any reasonable person would draw,'' said Col. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. The four-engine C-141B jet, based at <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, crashed Monday night about four miles north of <LOCATION> Hurlburt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> while on its landing approach. Seven crew members from <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> were on board. Also, a retired military passenger boarded during a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> civil engineers planned to work through the night with bulldozers and other heavy machinery to build a half-mile dirt road through the swamp and bridge a creek so vehicles could reach the crash site Wednesday. The site is within <LOCATION> Eglin </LOCATION>'s 720-square-mile military reservation, which is used for training maneuvers and weapons testing. `` The C-141 location along with heavy rains that have been falling since the crash are hampering rescue and recovery efforts,'' said Technical Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON>, an Eglin spokesman. Rescuers arrived by climbing down a rope from a hovering helicopter or by wading through water and underbrush, <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> said the front part of the aircraft was severely damaged and its left wing was completely sheared off. The rear two-thirds of the plane was visible, but the nose was obscured by thick foliage, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> who have a camp on the reservation were conducting manuevers in the area and were the first to arrive, about 30 minutes after the crash, <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> said. `` They saw the fireball,'' he said. Small fires burned hours after the crash. No munitions were aboard, said Col. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing at <LOCATION> Hurlburt </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> safety team is investigating the accident. <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> said there were severe thunderstorms in the area at the time, but he declined to say if weather figured in the crash. The $ 32 million C-141B is capable of carrying up to 200 soldiers in combat gear. The huge aircraft has a wingspan of 160 feet and is 168 feet long. The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo plane larger than a C-141 is the C-5A Galaxy.

<TEXT>
 Comedian <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> accepted the 1989 Man of the Year Award on Tuesday from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and found a new use for the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> group's traditional gift, a brass pudding pot. `` The country's only a trillion dollars in debt. Please help,'' he said as he passed the pot around at a news conference. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> wore a rainbow-colored brassiere and wig and shared a stage with female impersonators as he accepted the prize, which recognizes a `` lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment.'' `` I'll put it on the shelf,'' he promised. Hasty Pudding, the nation's oldest undergraduate dramatic organization, gave an identical brass pot and its Woman of the Year Award to actress <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> received his award before the curtain went up on the Hasty Pudding's 141st annual musical farce, a spoof on Prohibition called `` Whiskey Business.'' As always, the show has an all-male cast, including many students dressed as women. Since gaining fame as <PERSON> Mork </PERSON> in the television series `` Mork & amp; <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has gone on to success in films including `` The World According to Garp'' and `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>.'' His portrayal of <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON>, the comic disc jockey in `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' earned him a Golden Globe best-actor award and an Academy Award nomination in 1987. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Tuesday he had n't expected to win an Oscar: `` I did n't think I had a shot. It's just like <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> joining the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he believes comedy generally receives less recognition than it should. His latest movie, `` The Dead Poets Society,'' is scheduled for release in June. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he portrays a teacher of English literature in a private boys' school in 1959, a role with `` some humor, more drama.'' Hasty Pudding mebers advised <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who as <PERSON> Mork </PERSON> used to drink water with his finger, that he would be allowed to drink from the pudding pot with his finger. But they said cooking anything in the brass vessel could be a problem. When past man-of-the-year recipient <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> tried it, his melted.

 Storms and tornadoes besieged the South on Tuesday, ripping a roof off an elementary school in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, causing sewers to back up in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and dumping still more rain on flood-weary <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. A mass of warm and humid air spawned the severe storms and twisters in a wide band from the Gulf Coast states to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and the Carolinas the hardest hit. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a house under construction near <LOCATION> Lillington </LOCATION> collapsed in the high winds, killing one worker and injuring three others, authorities said. Wind tore off a quarter of the roof at a one-story elementary school in <LOCATION> Morven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, while classes were in session, said sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wadesboro </LOCATION>. No one was injured, and pupils were sent home. `` We had just had our tornado drill last week so that children knew exactly what to do,'' said school secretary <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. `` They were out of the classroom and in the hallway in about 15 seconds. They were perfect. You could not ask for them to be any better.'' Also in south-central <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the wind flipped over several small planes at <LOCATION> Anson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Four people received minor injuries when the wind tossed around trailer homes near <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and Zion's Grove, said a dispatcher. Up to 3,500 customers were without electricity in the <LOCATION> Rockingham </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wadesboro </LOCATION> areas, <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and Light spokesman <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said. Temperatures reached the high 80s in some <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities Tuesday, but a cold snap was expected to push readings into the teens by Wednesday. The forecast forced the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to cancel its annual statewide tornado drill planned for Wednesday because severe weather was on the way. `` You do n't want a test going on when you have the real thing,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedinger </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, which logged up to 11 inches of rain last week, received more rain Monday and Tuesday, sending rivers rising again. Temperatures were expected to dip below freezing overnight. The storm system dumped more than 3 additional inches of water on parts of southern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> before rains began to subside Tuesday afternoon. South of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, crews lowered a second pump by helicopter to the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> levee after the Rolling Fork of the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overflowed its banks. Officials said the pump being used to remove flood water from inside the levee could n't keep up with the latest rainfall. Police said the rain has contributed to the death of at least two people in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> _ a 19-year-old woman killed when her car hit a truck on a rain-slick highway and a man whose van was swept away by flood waters Thursday. Officials were still searching Tuesday for a second man who had been in the van. In western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> crest is being delayed by flooding on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which was expected to crest at <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION> at 44 feet, 4 feet above flood stage. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s high level has backed up operations at the <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riverport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. Grain ca n't be loaded onto barges again until water levels fall enough for the barges to move under a fixed loading spout, said port director <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. She did n't expect normal operations to resume until later in the week. The neaby <ORGANIZATION> Owensboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> can load barges because its dock is on higher ground, said traffic manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Edge </PERSON>, but the high water levels have prevented unloading incoming soybean shipments. Heavy rains blocked sections of at least 170 roads in 56 of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s 120 counties on Tuesday, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state Division of Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. He said as many as 2,000 Kentuckians have evacuated their homes since last week. The exact number was unknown because many people left on their own. Storms brought 2 more inches of rain to parts of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, flooding a few roads, but no evacuations were ordered, authorities said. In southeastern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, a tornado cut a path about a mile long near <LOCATION> Wicksburg </LOCATION> early Tuesday, damaging several roofs and bringing down trees and power lines, said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemmons </PERSON>, director of emegency management services in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. School in the mostly rural county was called off. The heavy rain flooded streets and homes in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, in the northwest corner, causing the sewer system to overflow, but only one family was evacuated, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangum </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, high wind swept through <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> counties, overturning mobile homes and uprooting trees, authorities said. The storms may have spawned a tornado that a <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy saw touch down near <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the jail administrator for the sheriff's department. Several trailers and turkey barns were damaged but no injuries were reported, he said. About 500 utility customers in southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> were without power Tuesday morning, but service was restored to all but a few isolated areas by midday, said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pataula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Membership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 Climatologists say it may take two decades to learn whether the greenhouse effect causes summer heat waves, and until then any government response to slow down global warming is just a gamble. A House Energy and Commerce panel, in testimony prepared for delivery today, has learned that experts differ over whether the gamble is worth taking now. At stake could be new and expensive environmental actions to reduce gases that trap heat like a garden greenhouse roof. In 1988, the earth experienced a series of climate-related events that some experts have long associated with the buildup of `` greenhouse'' gases: prolonged drought, heat waves, forest fires, a super hurricane and flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>.

 What if television news had been around to report on historic events, such as the Crusades? The producers of `` Timeline'' asked that question, and the result, a six-part series on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, premieres tonight. The answer is _ it would look pretty dumb. The series premieres tonight with `` The Crusades, 1187.'' The other episodes, airing in coming weeks, are `` The Black Death, 1361,'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION>, 1066,'' `` The Fall of Byzantium, 1453,'' `` The Mongol Empire, 1247'' and `` <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION>, 1492.'' If this is what it takes to make people swallow history lessons, we're doomed. Anyone dim enough to need former network newsman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> _ dressed in Medieval costume, no less _ to explain the Plague in sound bites, will sit still only long enough to realize this is not the <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> sketch it at first appears, then switch to `` Who's the Boss?'' The only immediate use for the six-part series would seem to be presenting it to caged junior high schoolers. First, there's the problem of making what is basically a historical documentary look like a news report, so there are confusing graphics on top of various scenes declaring the footage `` File'' or `` Live'' _ from the year 1187, or whatever, of course. Correspondents in period costume _ with names such as <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> of Canarfon or Siboletto of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> _ also confuse the viewer since they are intercut with `` interviews'' with participants in the events. Then, if that were n't enough, we're presented with explanations of past events that led up to the `` current'' situation, labeled `` 91 years ago,'' for instance. The history lesson is perfectly serious _ even though it seems <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> will appear at any moment _ but there are lame attempts at humor. The programs are interrupted occasionally by period `` commercials,'' such as one hawking chimneys, a new concept. The dramatizations are impressive in their careful attention to authentic detail in the costumes and sets _ if not in the rather overly enthusiastic acting. The series was taped on locations in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. But the programs are extremely wordy. The basic problem with `` Timeline'' is that it ultimately is not like television news _ television news would never bombard viewers with so much information.

<TEXT>
 To lean into the winds of inflation, even taking the risk that the economy will fall flat on its face. To reinforce economic reasoning and bolster its strength when political spending dreams get out of hand. These are two of the historic missions of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, an always controversial, often misunderstood, sometimes misguided powerhouse. It has no set image. To some people, including the presidents who nominate its chairmen, it is an arrogant bully; to others, it is a nervous nellie, its worry-red eyes seeking economic dangers hidden from the perception of others. In this regard, it has been accused of removing the punch bowl just as the fun begins _ which is to say that at the height of the economic celebration it seeks to keep its head so that everyone can drive home safely from the party. It reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but some congressmen have railed against it and had no impact at all. It keeps secrets; rarely is there a leak of inside discussions. And seldom does it explain its moves in great detail. Oddly, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s reticence gets it more space in the media than almost any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or any Cabinet officer could command. It also is the subject of endless speculation in the investment and political communities. Generally, it maintains an intellectual aloofness from political assaults. On the other hand, it has been accused again and again of timing its economic moves to help re-elect the incumbent party _ of creating election year booms. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> thus has many faces and many images at different times, but not now. Seldom has its mission been more explicit: It is going to face down the threat of inflation by slowing the American economy's growth rate. Moreover, it intends to get the job done before inflation does work its way into the economic marrow. Not forgotten is the 1970s experience, when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, for whatever reasons, allowed inflation to gather such steam it took the highest interest rates of the century and a deep recession to stop it. As usual, it has supporters and dissenters, and sometimes the two are combined. Wall Street is said to gain confidence from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s position on inflation, but some of those Wall Streeters are attracting the money of clients with forecasts of economic growth much higher than that prescribed by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Many people, including respected economists and even President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, feel the inflation danger is overstated. By his actions as chairman, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> could n't disagree more; relentlessly, he has forced up interest rates. Such action, it often is contended, threatens to replace one danger, inflation, with another, recession. Judging by its actions, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> agrees that there are indeed two dangers, and that recession is the more acceptable. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation policy not only has n't stopped the economy in its tracks but has n't been able to slow the growth rate to a target of only 2.5 percent or thereabouts. Many economists still expect growth of 3.5 percent this year. As the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> seems to view the situation, growth at 3.5 percent would so stress on the nation's plant capacity and labor force _ in both instances compelling the use of the least efficient of each _ that price increases would follow. But critics, as there always are when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is involved, contend that by raising interest rates the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will force companies to forego investments in greater plant capacity and more efficient technology and methods.

 Just a 20-minute walk east from the spires of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s high finance and the dome of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, signs of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> melt away into the sounds and smells of the Asian subcontinent. The mosque's wailing call to prayer drowns out the the toll of the church bell, swishing sari robes replace pinstripes and the scents of roast lamb and spice perfume the air in <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> _ the `` new world'' for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s latest immigrants, people from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Since the first Bangladeshis stepped off the boats three decades ago, some 30,000 have streamed into this part of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s East End. Like the Jews once predominant here, they have struggled to learn English, find shelter and work, and preserve their culture. A century ago Brick Lane was an area of infamous squalor, where <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripper </PERSON> stalked his victims. In World War II it was heavily bombed, and soon Jews began moving out, leaving the low-built houses and narrow streets to what has become the largest single concentration of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 160,000 Bangladeshis. Initially arriving for transient work, they have brought families, built five mosques in a square-mile area of Tower Hamlets borough and opened leather shops and grocery stores filled with chutneys and mangoes. One mosque used to be a synagogue. Having laid down roots and grown in number, the Bangladeshis have also discovered self-assertiveness, and have adopted a higher profile in demanding their rights as Moslems. They want more sexual segregation in state-funded schools where their children are in the majority, as well as government money for their private schools. <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' became an issue in mid-Februar among the Bangladeshis. Not all supported <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers. But they were vociferous in denouncing the novel as an insult to their faith, Islam. In many ways the issue was n't about <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, said <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahhab </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language weekly. `` It was about the reassertion of Moslem values onto British society which they feel have been ignored.'' The Bangladeshis have begun to shed the immigrant mentality and think of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as home. `` Five, 10 years ago, our people send all money to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and think ` I'm just working here,''' said <PERSON> Siraz </PERSON> <PERSON> Miah </PERSON>, a 28-year-old whose tiny leather factory is up a narrow staircase strewn with leather scraps. `` Now we think it's our country. Now people have house and business. Now is better.'' His 12 workers stitch 300 jackets a week on old sewing machines, surrounded by head-high piles of hide and the acrid smell of chemicals. They are among the fortunate. Twenty-seven percent of East End Bangladeshis are jobless. It was factories like this that prompted <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, during a 1987 visit, to liken <PERSON> Brick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s workplaces to subcontinent sweatshops. Something must be done, said the heir to the British throne, and the business community responded with 1.5 million pounds -LRB- $ 2.6 million -RRB- in donations for job-creation projects. <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodrul </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON>, who works the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamlets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, a job-promotion agency, says his focus is with the younger generation like <PERSON> Miah </PERSON>. A former social worker, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> helps his clients apply for interest-free loans for businesses, ranging from shops to market stalls. `` Many were not educated, even in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` But the younger generation are very important. `` The old people who came years ago have a lot of problems. They ca n't read or write. ... Some came over with 5,000 or 6,000 pounds,'' $ 9,000 to $ 17,000 in 1960. Arriving mostly from the <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, many early settlers were ship's cooks, with few skills and little English, who came alone intending to return home someday. Families followed, sometimes nearly a decade later because of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s tightening immigration laws, and a community grew. Now their children speak with Cockney accents. `` We have heard that Moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and go to discos. It's worrying us _ what comes next?'' said <PERSON> Daslim-Ali </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. Others trust the collective identity forged in <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> to teach the children. `` Nowadays lots of Bangladeshis are here, so our children know how we behave,'' said <PERSON> Taiyabur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, 55, who came in 1959 to open the first Bangladeshi travel agency in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` As long as our children are with us, they wo n't be lost.'' But while life improves, problems remain. Racist violence, a threat wherever <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 800,000 <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants are clustered, is acute in Tower Hamlets. The <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamlets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> says it received about 2,500 complaints of racial harassment in 1987, mostly over beatings and broken windows. It reported seven arson attacks on Asian homes, none of which caused injuries. Speaking little English and a dialect that has no written form, immigrants are often cut off from police, jobs and social services. With a birthrate five times above the national average, men must feed five to seven mouths on the lowest average wage of any ethnic minority in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> report said. But it noted the `` strengths of the community, particularly its culture and extent of self-help within families.'' The district still has a few reminders of its Jewish past _ an all-night bagel shop or the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsky </PERSON> and Sons textile store. But the Jews do not seem bitter about the newcomers. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsky </PERSON>, whose father started the business in 1902, eagerly shows a visitor around <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> stores in old tenements. `` The Asians show you how a business can be run,'' he said.

<HEAD>Primeval Forest is Last Refuge for Lowland Gorilla</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAYANGA, Central African Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This is as remote a place as you can get in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The large-scale map of the <LOCATION> Bayanga </LOCATION> region shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not a single paved road. In this heart of darkness, hundreds of miles from the nearest village, man's closest relative in the animal kingdom, the lowland gorilla, has found his last refuge, a sanctuary of sorts from Pygmy tribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide. The gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically under tough protection in the Central African Republic. But the government has neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protective laws. There are two main groups of gorillas in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: the mountain gorilla in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> _ whose habitat and life style have been fully explored _ and the lowland gorilla who remains largely a mystery. The mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and gradually allows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with human beings. The lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive, explains <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who has made the gorilla his life's work, rarely gets close enough to strike up an acquaintance In more than five years' work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest He estimates that a desolate area of 40,000 square miles of forest where the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> meet may still have at least 90,000 gorillas permanently settled there. With the exception of rare logging camps along he rivers, there is no human activity in this area, and the gorillas have until recently remained undisturbed. In recent years, the logging camps have developed, and there has been `` heavy illegal poaching'' for meat and the ivory of elephants who are the other main inhabitants of the region. In the central market in <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, the Central African capital 220 miles to the east, stands are piled high smoked monkey meat, a local delicacy. `` Gorillas taste like monkeys, only better,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Somse </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s Pygmy guide. `` And there is more of them.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Bayembe </LOCATION> with his wife and 3-year-old daughter, has been trying to teach the Pygmies why the gorillas are best left alone. It's an almost hopeless task. The Pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows. But larger Africans, those brought in to work the logging camps, use rifles and even machine guns, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` They bribe the Pygmies to help them by giving them clothes and liquor. In some areas, we find snares made of cables stolen from the logging companies every few yards along trails used by the gorrillas.'' The gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the ever-present ginger-like Aframomum shrub, the fruit of tropical trees and the eggs of termites. `` It's quite common to see a 400-pound silverback gorilla climb more than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` They love that more than anything. `` They will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there.'' In some areas on the ground, gorilla nests are visible every five or six yards. But the gorillas scamper away when they sense a human being approach. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has been trying to persuade the Central African government to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwestern tip of the country. But in reality, the effort is useless unless the other two governments in the area, the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, cooperate. Meanwhile, the poaching goes on. Even poorly paid wildlife guards sometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas and elephants. And the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect the poachers from the guards. `` It would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` We have to crawl on our hands and feet to get close to them, and even then we do n't see them'til we are a foot or two away. With a radio, we could find a place ahead of them and watch them coming.'' He said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials, and, as such, are by far the closest animals to man. But he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system of control and the inability of local governments and European and American organizations to stop the poaching. `` Recently we were in a camp on the <LOCATION> Sangha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where it forms the border with the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. A Congolese gunboat came up the river and ordered us to get out of there. We were clearly in the C.A.R. -LRB- Central African Republic -RRB-. But quite obviously, we were interfering with their poaching.''

<HEAD>Green Consumer Movement Gains Momentum in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` green consumer'' movement is gaining momentum in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and environmentalism is becoming mainstream. Now many Europeans need only to go to the neighborhood supermarket if they want organically grown vegetables, low-mercury batteries, or what have become known as environment-friendly diapers and cruelty-free cosmetics, those marketed without being tested on laboratory animals. Consumers increasingly are demanding products that do n't `` cost the earth,'' and companies are seizing the new opportunity, experts say. `` People realize that by exercising choice on the high street -LRB- main street -RRB- they can change the way the environment is treated,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON>, a British environment official. `` There's a growing acceptance that we ca n't go on using and destroying the world's natural resources.'' She was one of 11 speakers at a recent <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference of officials from government, industry and environmental groups called `` Attracting the Green Consumer.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, an advertising consultant, told the conference: `` Green issues are not just flavor of the month. This could become the world's central project for the next century.'' Here are just some of the steps governments have taken: _ The 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and 23 other countries have committed themselves to cutting back the use of CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, by 50 percent by the end of the century CFCs, used as propellants, are thought to deplete the earth's protective ozone shield. _ <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> plans a 100-lire -LRB- 8-cent -RRB- tax on consumers for each non-biodegradable plastic bag they take from the store _ The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> is offering tax breaks to people who buy cars that meet strict anti-pollution standards _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for years has put `` Blue Angel'' labels on products that meet its environmental standards The Scandinavian countries, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are following suit. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has switched her fleet of cars to lead-free gasoline, and her son <PERSON> Prtince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> has banned aerosol sprays from his home. Green consumerism offers many opportunities to companies, but confronts them with a complex market, the experts said. `` The highest levels of concern are shown by the more affluent groups of society,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, a marketing expert. But `` there are lots of different green consumers. They are motivated by different concerns and have widely different patterns.'' They range from 1960s-style hippies and current-day `` guppies'' -LRB- green yuppies -RRB- to mothers concerned about their children's future, she said. The green opportunities mean companies can make money directly, by selling green products, as well as indirectly, by enhancing their reputation. `` Our reputation clearly helps our business,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the British subsidiary of the similarly named <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> household products maker. His company removed CFCs from its aerosols in 1986, a costly exercise, and labels products environment-friendly. Disposable diapers are one of the latest products to go green and earn the reputation of being environment-friendly. Procter and <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, joining other companies, is selling chlorine-free diapers in six countries. The chlorine-processed diapers contain tiny residues of the highly poisonous chemical dioxin. <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, no relation to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supermarket chain, has removed contentious or detrimental ingredients from its own products, such as artificial color in its own-brand orange soda. It also recycles its cardboard and offers its customers free, recycled paper bags. It has built a CFC-free refrigeration center in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The British confectioner <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> is among companies that have opted for a link with a worthy cause. In 1985 it began donating a percentage of sales of a chocolate Wildlife Bar to the World Wildlife Fund to help endangered animals. The animals are depicted on the bars' labels. Research has found that consumers are willing to pay more for environment-friendly products. <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, an expert on environmental issues, said some West German retailers are believed to charge more for products that carry the `` Blue Angel'' label, even though some of these products are cheaper to make. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hailes </PERSON>, co-author of `` The Green Consumer Guide,'' said green products initially will cost more, but their prices will decline as they are mass-produced. Despite green consumerism's growing momentum, both consumers and companies remain reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly, the experts said. Organic produce still represents less than 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>'s total produce sales, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Combes </PERSON>, a director The government's Mrs. <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> lamented that only 2 percent of the auto fuel consumed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is unleaded `` People will not do what they say they do for the environment unless its very easy,'' <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> said. `` Personal benefit may still be the key to adopting green issues. The idea of doing something for the common good is still not a motivation for people yet, unfortunately.'' The experts said the threat of consumer criticism is very real. `` There's a very great danger that we could have an inconsistency here of polluting the environment while producing green products,'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said. For instance, he added, lead-free gas might reduce air pollution, but its manufacture produces at least one highly toxic byproduct. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, a manager at <ORGANIZATION> Boots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MicroCheck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a chemicals maker, said: `` Some manufacturers have made preservative-free claims when the product did n't need to be preserved in the first place. These attempts to mislead the consumer should be actively discouraged.''

Children were told to hold their telephones toward the screen, whereupon tone-activated signals dialed up that jolly old elf so the kids could chat with him, while the computer logged and charged for the calls. Things have changed in the telephone world, not so much because the changes are needed, but because they are possible. And profitable. Today's telephone junky can have intimate chats with all kinds of strangers. Now a whole new series of 1-900 numbers are opening up. On some you are a quiz show guest, answering with your push-button phone to maybe win a prize. But you pay for the call, perhaps $ 2 for openers and more if you stay on the line. A simple call on one adult sex line in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> can run $ 20 or more, whether you talk or not. The telephone has spawned a new business that some say is eclipsing $ 400 million a year and growing. An evening of letting your fingers do the walking can ring up a $ 200 phone bill in a couple of hours. The same comforting device that gave you grandma's warm and comforting voice now gives you everything from strange sex to sexy strangers, from gays in search of companionship to high school kids on a high. It offers up the stock market, the latest interest rates, advice on mortgages. Its recorded voices tell you what meetings there are in your community, where to shop for an auto loan, when to get up, how to pray, what your biorhythms are, when your stars are favorable, when they are not, how to get a date whatever your sexual or racial choice, who is going to win the Super Bowl and what the point spread is, where to get free money for college. Dial and get the latest jokes, the top horse racing picks, lottery results, a daily diet, skiing bargains, sports scores, government job openings, insults, wine choices, movie reviews, soap opera reviews, music trivia, sports trivia, trivial trivia. That's not all. On the gab lines you can chat with strangers, search for a date, leave your number for promised human adventure, dispel in seven push-button digits that most universal of all human conditions, loneliness. And if one is too shy, dial the adult lines -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> there are more than 200 of them -RRB- and become an aural voyeur to kinky sex, erotic fantasy. From their lips to your ear, and only the telephone billing computer will know. It is 5:30 a.m. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has sandwiched in between its late-night rerun and morning business shows a commercial or two showing a black-dressed villain and a pretty blonde a la Perils of <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> urging viewers to call a certain 970 number and rescue this damsel from certain boredom. When the number is reached -LRB- after several tries -RRB- a woman's voice says the call will cost $ 5 unless you hang up now. Then you are assigned your personal code number and given another telephone number to call. After several tries again, you enter your code, then push another number as instructed and finally reach a young, breathless voice named <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>. She is apparently ready to field your favorite fantasy, although she volunteers nothing. You find that she is a 22-year-old college graduate -LRB- political science -RRB- from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state university, is thinking about joining the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, and is saving money to go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to visit a friend. You hesitate to ask, `` What's a nice girl like you doing in this racket,'' and inquire instead, `` Are you well-paid for this?'' She answers no. Then someone steps in and terminates the call. Either time was up or the questions were going too far.

 Three weeks later the television invitation to call carries a sotto voce addendum: `` Ten dollars a call.'' This particular operation is offered by one of a group of companies, known usually as <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, although in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> the name is <ORGANIZATION> HDL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The marketing and promotion is handled by a firm called the <ORGANIZATION> Megaquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The companies employ about 500 people and operate in about 30 cities domestically, plus all of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. One of the satellite companies, <PERSON> Phonequest </PERSON>, was the one that engineered the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> calling show. It was syndicated to 30 domestic and four foreign markets. When the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> station began getting irate calls, it quickly ran a warning to children with the printed words telling them to ask Mom and Dad first. Why did Phonequest, which has used the program for four years, rely on the electronic dialing technique? A spokesman said it was to prevent children from dialing the wrong number. When one of the firm's 970 numbers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was dialed and reached after several abortive tries, a pretentiously sexy female voice answered and offered to be companionable. When the phone bill came in, it registered four calls and two additional minutes. The charge was $ 79.80, even though three of the calls never produced an answer. When the number was called back, post billing, this was the conversation: Hi, welcome to party line. How much does this call cost? You did n't hear the recording? There was no recording. Nineteen ninety-five. Goodbye. That number also was advertised on television, with an attractive young woman adding under her breathless message, `` $ 19.95 a call.'' It so happened that particular number was another Omni Phone enterprise. <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Superfon </PERSON>, known erroneously in the trade as `` <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Superphone </PERSON>,'' is chief executive officer of the Seattle-based firm. She says the company offers everything from soap opera updates to joke lines, from dial-an-insult to group access lines. She outlined plans to go into other areas with information storage and retrieval via voice, a kind of telephone postal service, as well as interconnections between computers, and varying menues available on a single line to get specific data, for instance in sports, that the caller desires. There is also a proposal to acquire her firm from herself and partners <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>. They claim a 1987 net income of not less than $ 4 million. The would-be acquirer is a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> firm called <ORGANIZATION> WurlTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, which is listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as a billiard table manufacturer. It was recently quoted at about a dollar a share. Of the unanswered but charged-for calls, Ms. <PERSON> Superfon </PERSON> said she would refund any justifiable costs on receipt of a complaining letter. She said there is a quality control program to prevent such errors. Would she continue the current gab line and adult services in light of her future plans? `` Absolutely. People are lonely, have been lonely and always will be lonely.'' Besides, for many people the phone lines provide a real service for companionship, even though many of the people who link up by voice rarely see each other. `` Telephones are really safe,'' she says. There is already the beginning of a second generation of telephone-line dating. From <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> comes word of a `` Fax,'' or facsimile-transmitter club, which for a few hundred dollars will let you fax your message to someone else's fax, and never hear their voice if you do n't want to. Industry-wide, most dial-it entrepreneurs would talk only on a not-for-attribution basis. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwell </PERSON>, editor of the Information Industry Bulletin, one of the few authoritative sources in the dial-it industry, says using the telephone for information is nothing new. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> telephone operators have been giving the time of day since the late 1920s, with the weather and traffic information following. The old operator and the party line were avenues for news and gossip. Advertising is a major expense for today's purveyors. Small operations rely on word-of-mouth and matchbook covers to pass on tantalizing phone numbers.

 Bigger operators use television. Evening television movies are interrupted with all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractive young women, purring, `` There's a party on your line whenever you want. Call as often as you want.'' Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in advertising, but the expansion and invasion of the information telephone services, sanctioned by state and local authorities, is becoming troublesome to many. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the state legislature and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> made it mandatory for the telephone company to block lines to such calls at the customer's request. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has a suit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn operators to force them to cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> says it makes an effort to survey the talk lines and operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off disruptive or obscene callers. While this works on some lines, it does n't seem to work on others. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> will now block dial-it calls from residences for free. Until this January, there was a $ 5 charge. Businesses must pay $ 10 and up, depending on the number of lines. The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if the customer complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls without parental permission. After that, the customer is urged to have the line blocked, or keep their youngsters off the phone. The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whether the dial-it service collects or not. One <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> company says uncollected calls cost it $ 400,000 a year. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> shut down dial-a-porn services in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1984 and so far has been upheld by the courts. The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantiqua </PERSON>, a 49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropout in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Her son, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON>, had run up a $ 1,400 phone bill, calling various party lines. In desperation she put the phone in her daughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night in January, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> broke into his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth and strangled her, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to hear a case this spring in which a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn operator, <ORGANIZATION> Sable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgements of freedom of speech. The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans sexually explicit telephone message services. The law prohibits any obscene or indecent communications for commercial purposes over interstate lines. It provides for fines up to $ 500,000 and prison terms up to two years. Whatever course the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decides, there are a number of area phone companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect the telephone information business in general, are planning to curtail or segregate the pornographic and gab lines. The revenues are important. One <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state official said the information services help subsidize the general telephone services. Those services which cater to homosexuals are more serious than other gab lines. They permit callers to talk with a group or `` barhop'' by pressing a designated key on push-button phones. One operator of such lines says they perform a real service, all the more critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic. `` Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good thing to do,'' he says. `` Gays take this more seriously than do the straights who tend to goof off and hambone on the gab lines.'' Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best. Quality equipment is expensive, some devices running $ 2,000 a line or more. They force a telephone line, capable of carrying two voices, to carry six to eight. Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come to fruition, some fail for lack of continuing innovation. It is a copycat business. Some reserved lines are still vacant. There are thousands more available. The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with dead bodies, lost fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones out there, each a potential market. Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Western states. Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls are showing up. But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent caller says, `` It's cheaper than going out.'' Or was.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ At Costello's Restaurant, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> watering place where celebrities are legendary, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> has found a home at age 83. He is, by popular acclaim, the World's Worst Waiter. His customers would have it no other way.

 <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pischler </PERSON> stands at the counter, motionless, his back to the thinning crowd. His pencil rests idly on his order pad. Is he adding a check? Figuring his tips? No. The noonday rush has been wearing on <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. He is taking a nap. Give him a moment. Soon his head will jerk upward and he will resume his slow shuffling among the tables at Costello's Restaurant in effortless affirmation of the title his fans have voted him: the World's Worst Waiter. Those who dispute the title point out <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>'s occasional displays of dining room efficiency. Should a customer ask for another roll, for example, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> often reaches in his pocket where he keeps a supply, saving all those steps to the kitchen. When one customer asked what the creamy stuff was on his sandwich, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> scooped up some on his finger and licked it. `` Butter,'' he said, and shuffled on. The restaurant was founded in 1928 by <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> immigrants of happy memory, who discovered shortly after stepping off the boat that running a speak-easy was more profitable than driving a truck. From the beginning the genial Irishmen attracted an assortment of New Yorkers who appreciated a stalwart drink, an uncomplicated menu and good cheer. Costello's walls are decorated with original works by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most noted cartoonists, beginning with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>, and its roster of regulars over the years included <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, A.J <PERSON> Liebling </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Addams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and legions of uncelebrated working folk, always a most tolerant clientele. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> found a home there. That was 22 years ago, the longest he has ever held a job. In all that time, few have learned his last name. He is just <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. He won the title of World's Worst Waiter back in 1974, by popular acclaim of awed customers who observed him at work and also learned something of his past. No official document certifies the title, but in 15 years no challenger has come forward and so the folks at Costello's figure it is <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>'s by default. A clipping on the wall from a British publication is documentation enough that the title is truly international. You will hear no criticism of <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> at Costello's. Instead, a pastime among a group at the end of the bar is to make side bets on whether <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> gets the right order to the right customer, without accident. `` Herbie's completion rate,'' says <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, the proprietor and son of the founder, `` is about 75 percent.'' `` I'm not as young as I used to be,'' <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> replies. `` At my age you're bound to make a few mistakes.'' <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> will be 83 on July 31. He was born in <LOCATION> Ludwigshafen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the zeppelin made its appearance at about the same time. In fact, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> and the zeppelin are of similar design, sort of egg-shaped. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>, asleep or awake, stands 5-foot-6, a wizened gnome with thin gray hair and hazel eyes. At 16, he took a job as cabin boy on a German merchant ship and made his way to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. In time he became second steward on the presidential yacht docked in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, where his true greatness was first noticed. Is the report accurate, he was asked, that he spilled a bowl of soup on the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> who had come aboard for a state dinner? `` No,'' says <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>, `` It is not true. I spilled the soup on the colonel sitting next to him. Only a little got on the prince. `` It was not my fault,'' <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> hastens to add. `` The carpet tripped me.''

 Jobless, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> wandered around <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in 1929 came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Not a good year to find a job. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and became a mess cook, as they are called, in <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>'s case perhaps aptly. When the Depression wound down <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and resumed the career that led to his deserved acclaim. He began as a dishwasher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and worked his way to the bottom, building an impressive resume. `` I worked at the old Plaza Hotel, the Ambassador, the English Grill, the Astor. Then I went to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and worked in the fancy places at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` I went to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Edgewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>. I worked in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION>. You know the Greenbrier?'' Were you a good waiter, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>? `` One of the best. You could n't work at those places unless you were one of the best.'' Were you ever fired? `` Never. Never.'' Why did you move around so much? `` When you are young, you must move. You must ... adventure!'' Did you ever have any noteworthy adventures at any of those places? `` Are you asking did I spill a pot of coffee on that columnist guy, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>? Yes, I spilled the coffee.'' The carpet's fault? `` The carpet's fault.'' A few more stains on the linoleum _ happily, Costello's has no carpet _ or on <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>'s pants and shirt sleeves for that matter, are viewed here merely as badges of honest, if at times maladroit, labor. Indeed, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, consider <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> and his WWW title as an asset. It is a rare attitude in this bottom-line town where family-owned restaurants with individual traditions and values have become almost extinct. Since Prohibition's repeal in 1933, Costello's has had to move three times to stay alive, but never farther than half a block. It has been at its present spot at 225 East 44th since 1974. With each move, its most cherished movable treasures went with it _ the bar, the back bar, the Thurber drawings, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. The bar is of cigarette-scarred oak rubbed to a warm patina by three generations of elbows. Three generations of mementos decorate the back bar. Above an array of bottles rises a clutter of photographs and testimonials, and above these hang an assortment of gifts from grateful customers. They include a cavalry saber from the Spanish civil war; a `` TC'' branding iron from <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> editor turned <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> rancher, and the remains of a blackthorn walking stick that <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> broke over the head of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> in 1944, not in anger but on a bet. The story, from an eyewitness, is that <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> claimed blackthorn was the only wood that could n't be broken over an Irishman's head. <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> bet he could break that very stick over the head of that very Irishman. He padded <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>'s head with napkins, laid the stick on the napkins and took hold of each end. `` Brace yourself, <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' he said, and pulled down until the stick cracked. At Costello's, legends abound. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>, the World's Worst Waiter, is already one of them.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s love affair with the robot apparently has gone sour. Orders for the mechanical marvels have been on the decline in recent years after reaching a peak in 1984. One reason is, robots are still pretty dumb and corporations are hesitant to invest large amounts of money to develop smarter models.

 Scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robot the wave of the future. It would free housewives of drudgery and fill factories with a tireless steel-collar work force. But in many ways, the wave has been a washout. Robots can paint cars, salvage nuclear fuel and even assist in brain surgery, but they're still pretty dumb. And they are far from the science fiction promise of comic books and movies. `` Robots now are significantly better than 30 years ago, but that does n't necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an R2-D2 or C-3PO,'' says <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the robot characters in the movie `` Star Wars.'' Orders for American-made robots have been falling since their peak of $ 501 million in 1984, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Robotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Experts say automating a factory is more complicated than just buying a robot and putting it on the assembly line. In addition, they say, some industrial robots are too complicated and prone to failure and, when they do work, they do n't always fit in with factory operations. About 33,000 robots work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, mostly in manufacturing, with automakers buying at least 40 percent, says robots association spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnstein </PERSON>. `` It's not a revolution. It's an evolution,'' <PERSON> Burnstein </PERSON> says. `` Robots are another new, productive technology in the same way that computers were.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the world's leading robot user, followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` Robots are still dumb,'' <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON> says. `` They're dumb because we have n't taken the trouble to put the pieces together, not because we do n't know how. That takes money and time and effort, and we do n't have the money. But today's robots can: _ See They do n't see like humans, but they can recognize forms and shapes and measure distances through sonar, ranging devices and lasers. _ Hear and speak They use computers that recognize thousands of words. _ Smell Their sensors can detect smoke or fumes. _ Move They most often roll on wheels, but some models hop on one leg and others walk with as many as eight legs, ambling like a spider on uneven terrain. _ Touch They can recognize texture and the force of a movement, such as pressing. Many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree, but creating a competent robot that combines most or all of them has been difficult. In addition, scientists have found it's difficult to match human abilities that most people take for granted, such as the dexterity of a finger or the ability to identify objects. `` The rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy, then it's usually difficult,'' says <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanade </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> institute. `` The list of things that robots can do better than humans is much, much shorter than the list of things robots can not.'' Industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision, including welding, assembling, painting, packaging and loading, yet <PERSON> Burnstein </PERSON> estimates that less than 5 percent of American companies have installed even one robot. Japanese companies, which have installed more than twice as many robots as American companies, have been more willing to invest in robots that take years to pay for themselves, <PERSON> Burnstein </PERSON> says. `` Robots are very expensive to make and they can do very little,'' says <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Moravec </PERSON>, senior research scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's hard to find a job for them that actually pays off.'' <PERSON> Moravec </PERSON> says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect. `` The robots working on the assembly line today might well be compared to spiders,'' he says. `` They do their jobs competently, but it's a narrow job.'' Industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thing goes wrong, forcing humans to their aid, says <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Michie </PERSON>, chief scientist of the <ORGANIZATION> Turing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which conducts research into artificial intelligence.

 <PERSON> Michie </PERSON> is trying to develop computers that learn from experience _ a technology that could result in robots that adjust to changing circumstances and learn from mistakes. <PERSON> Moravec </PERSON> believes technology will enable robots to have human-like intelligence in about 50 years. Service robots, a new breed, are moving off the factory floor to handle work in hazardous environments, help the disabled, or just sweep floors. Underwater robots are examining lake bottoms and doing risky deep-sea work. Doctors at Memorial Medical Center of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, have performed more than 35 brain operations with the help of a robot arm that guides surgeons as they drill into the skull. Research is under way at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> on a six-legged robot to explore the surface of Mars in the next decade and on a car that can drive itself. University researchers also made robots to remove radioactive waste from the crippled <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant near <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. K.G. <PERSON> Engelhardt </PERSON>, director of the university's health and human services lab, is developing a robotic work station that allows the disabled, especially those without the use of their hands, to work in an office. The station should be marketed by the end of the year, selling for less than $ 50,000, she says. <PERSON> Tish </PERSON> <PERSON> Pferdehirt </PERSON>, 44, a vocational rehabilitation counselor in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, helps test the station. With paralyzed legs and only limited use of her arms, she knows first-hand the benefits of such a helpmate. `` It does all kinds of things from getting a book off a shelf for me, to turning off a radio, to picking up a file and putting it in an in-out box,'' she says. The work station has an arm that turns, bends and swivels as Ms. <PERSON> Pferdehirt </PERSON> speaks commands into a microphone. It fetches things, looks up telephone numbers and dials the phone. Ms. <PERSON> Engelhardt </PERSON> hopes to make the robot work on projects independently, such as shredding paper, when she is not there, thus making it more valuable. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON> has big corporate backers for his service robots. Projects in the works at <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Transitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, include development of robots that will sweep or scrub floors in airports or supermarkets and fetch drugs for pharmacists in mail-order warehouses. Another Engelberger robot is Help-Mate, a nurse's aide that delivers meals to hospital patients and makes other deliveries, such as taking a urine specimen to a lab. Help-Mate, designed to use elevators and negotiate hallways as it moves by itself on wheels, is being tested, and <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON> said it will go on sale for $ 40,000 by year's end. <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON> hopes to get corporate backing to build his dream robot: a $ 50,000 household helper that would prepare light meals, clean house and clear snow. But he ca n't figure out how to teach it to make beds. He estimates it would take up to $ 14 million and 2 -LCB- years to develop, but American companies so far have been unwilling to make the initial investment. <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON> helped pioneer an industrial robot more than 30 years ago, but the history of the automaton goes back farther. `` The whole idea of building a mechanical man is fairly old,'' <PERSON> Moravec </PERSON> says. `` There were clockwork automatons built by Swiss and French clocksmiths in the 18th century and 17th century.'' The term robotics was coined in 1942 in a science fiction story by <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> from the word robot, which was coined in 1921 by Czech playwright <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. In 1954, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inventor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Devol </PERSON> filed a patent for a programmable robot arm whose movement was controlled by punched program cards. In 1958, <PERSON> Devol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON> formed a company to build the machines. Their first industrial robot was installed in 1961 in a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant. <PERSON> Engelberger </PERSON> says visions in the 1950s of a robot-filled world fizzled when the promises outran technology. `` Everything was supposed to become automated,'' he says. `` It was all blue sky, but the technology was n't available. The technology is just becoming available, but I have a difficult time convincing people we can do it today.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ For centuries they were the playgrounds of the rich, but in recent years the lavish health spas of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have depended mainly on the aging and infirm who could take the waters at government expense. Now the pendulum is swinging again and guess who gave it a big push. Health-conscious yuppies, known among Germans as `` Schickimickis,'' have discovered the spa scene.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most-famous health spas, like this 19th century playground for the rich, royal and renowned, are enjoying a renaissance among an emerging class of European yuppies. `` Take a look _ and get looked at,'' is one of the advertising slogans luring a hedonistic crowd into the spa social scene that for the past 30 years has been dominated by the weak and aging. In a period of federal belt-tightening, the resorts that in the postwar years have focused on government-sponsored health care are now turning back to the healthy and wealthy who bestowed their original fame. A modest trimming of social security benefits that took effect with the new year promises to cut into the ranks of 8.4 million `` cure guests'' who take the waters each year in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But administrators of the most distinguished baths say they had long been expecting fiscal conservatism to catch up with the cushy health care system. Some, like <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, have begun catering to a new generation of guests, a younger crowd of well-heeled professionals known among Germans as `` Schickimickis.'' Sequined and tuxedoed, the elite envoys of the 30-to-40 set saunter and gamble in the path of <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoevski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> in <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>'s glittering casino. Dwindling in number are the elderly and ailing bingo players in an adjacent parlor of the Kurhaus. A sprawling seven-pool, glass-enclosed `` bathing temple'' completed three years ago draws 1,500 guests a day, increasingly from among younger couples and singles who come here for long weekends to play tennis, relax and flaunt their newfound prosperity. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, manager of the German <ORGANIZATION> Bathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, says the spas are attracting a broader group of guests and becoming less dependent on the publicly insured clientele. Under the 1956 legislation that set up today's elaborate social security net, West Germans are entitled to a spa treatment as often as every three years if their doctors recommend it. Until this year, the federally funded health insurance network paid the full cost of a three - or four-week bathing cure for those recuperating from illness or taking a respite from the stresses of work or family life Cure clients must now pay 10 percent of the cost of their treatments, which run an average of $ 2,750 for four weeks, plus most of their hotel and food expenses. `` We do n't know exactly what effect the changes in the law will have on the industry, and we hope this is n't too strong a blow,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> says. `` But we have been enjoying a steady growth over the past year or two of younger visitors, and by younger I mean those in their 30s who want to go away for a few days for a small vacation rather than a cure.'' <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholemy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>'s spa association general manager, contends the cutbacks are shortsighted. `` Some of those who would benefit from rest and recuperation will put off taking a cure because of the expense, then end up in the hospital which will cost more for a few days than a preventative cure,'' he says. But spa administrators expect that a trend among younger Germans to take better care of their health promises to more than compensate for an expected drop in visits by guests on social security. `` The changes in our clientele have had a positive economic effect,'' says <PERSON> Sigrun </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, chairwoman of <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>'s spa association. `` While the guest here for a publicly funded cure is often on a restricted budget during his four-week stay, those staying for a three-day convention or a long weekend tend to spend a lot in the shops and the casino.'' A slender, 40-ish executive, Mrs. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> says the more successful spas are cashing in on the younger generation's growing absorption with health and appearance. Despite a nationwide unemployment rate of 8.5 percent, a new affluence is visible among the younger, college-educated crowd in major cities like <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. And like their baby boom contemporaries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, West Germans in their 30s and early 40s are gradually moving into the upper echelons of government and industry. Foreign guests continue to account for more than a quarter of the spa patronage, with wealthy Americans, Arabs, Japanese and Europeans replacing the Russian nobility of the last century. Fewer turn to the mystic healing effects of water to cure serious illnesses these days, but the younger generations frequenting the spas are bringing along new health challenges for the resorts to tackle. The opulent art deco complex at <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nauheim </LOCATION>, for example, now offers a program to break the smoking habit. Bad Mergentheim, nestled in a scenic valley of vineyards along the famous Romantic Road, attracts a new clientele with its weight-reduction course. Bad Aachen, at the three-nation crossroads with <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Charlemagne </PERSON> took the waters 1,200 years ago, now offers stress-management clinics. Managers of smaller spas and the hotels and restaurants supported by cure guests are nervous about the effects of the streamlining. They point out that only a few dozen of the 264 officially recognized health spas in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are esteemed enough to get by on the clientele that pays its own way. `` There is no other industry here except the spas,'' says <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Requeer </PERSON>, treatment director at the city cure house in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Muenstereifel </LOCATION>, a scenic hamlet in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Eifel </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. `` We do n't get a lot of younger visitors here because most of our patients are elderly and the atmosphere must remain quiet.'' School director <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Meinhardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, taking a cure at <LOCATION> Baden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baden </LOCATION> this winter at her own expense, said the federal cutbacks are unlikely to deter those strongly in need of rest and may encourage more personal responsibility about one's health. Referring to her countrymen's propensity to drink and smoke more than other Europeans, she contended that, `` One should n't expect the government to provide an all-expense-paid cure for a lifetime of bad living habits.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ He trudged the frozen wilderness around the Great Lakes in the middle of the 19th century, spreading the Christian religion among the Indians. While establishing his missions, Bishop <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON> also put the spoken tongues of the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ojibwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> into written words.

 Scholars count the miracles and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellico </PERSON> count the winters as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s `` Snowshoe Priest'' travels a long path toward possible sainthood. To many around here, Bishop <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic missionary who spent a lifetime converting Indians to Christianity in the 19th century, is a saint already. They believe canonization of <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> is inevitable. `` There is n't much doubt in our minds. We believe he is a saint,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoren </PERSON> at the Sacred Heart Church in L'Anse, where <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON> built his last mission. <PERSON> Thoren </PERSON>'s mother was part of the first move to canonize <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> that began 37 years ago. Since then, the church has approved <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION>'s writings and has verified his sanctity. Now it must accept the miracles. `` Either it will be very soon, or it will be an extremely long process,'' says <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> <PERSON> Walling </PERSON>, who for five years has gathered <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> material and sent it to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` I have no doubt that it will happen.'' While <PERSON> Walling </PERSON> works for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> diocese, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellico </PERSON> keep the faith at the <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION> in L'Anse. The elderly couple sells trinkets to the tourists who stop at the shrine to see a 35-foot brass and copper statue of the traveling priest. When they can, they sit strangers down over hot tea and cookies and tell them of their candidate for sainthood. <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON> was born in 1797, the son of wealthy landowners in French-occupied <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, now a part of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The young priest left a fractured church in his homeland in 1830 to establish missions among the Ojibwa and <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territory </LOCATION>. He spent 23 years among Indians and settlers on Lakes <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and Superior, traveling hundreds of miles by canoe, snowshoe and even ice floe, spreading the Gospel and putting the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ojibwa </LOCATION> tongue into written words. <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON> used the Indians as guides. He also relied on them as rescuers, for sometimes he was found to be wandering in circles in the winter wilderness. His feats are legendary to the people of the northern woods, where a county, town and state park are named after him. The <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> people also remain keenly aware of their native son. They send representatives to <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> each year for ceremonies remembering him. But Baraga sometimes encountered hostility among the Native Americans he worked with. Their reaction, then and now, has been mixed. `` There are those who realize the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ojibwa </LOCATION> -RRB- would have moved West or simply disappeared if it had n't been for him,'' <PERSON> Walling </PERSON> says. `` He helped save them by giving them a written language. `` Then, there are some who feel all white men, missionaries included, led to the destruction of the Indian nation. Actually, I think the real cause was alcohol.'' `` I guess there is mixed feeling,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hascall </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who is also an <LOCATION> Ojibwa </LOCATION> pipe carrier -LRB- religious man -RRB- and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takakwitha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Missionaries came close to robbing the Ojibwa and other Indians of their native beliefs in God, or Kije Manito, the Great Spirit, <PERSON> Hascall </PERSON> says. `` Baraga did not understand that,'' he adds. `` He thought he was converting pagans.

 `` I'm not demeaning Father Baraga. Anybody bringing <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> would enrich us. His every effort was to build us up, which he really did accidentally by preserving our language. He was a man who was sincere, which made him in the Indian way a holy man.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>, a 58-year-old Ojibwa, grew up with the <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> legend, handed down from his father and grandfather. `` They held him in reverence,'' he says. `` One of my earliest memories was seeing a picture of him.'' Baraga built homes and schools for the Ojibwa and purchased 500 acres of land for the tribe, <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON> says. Just recently the <LOCATION> Keweenaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> obtained the deed for the land from the <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION> diocese. Today, <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION>'s outpost at L'Anse is surrounded by an Ojibwa reservation where children read their history in the language <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON> penned. Summers at the shrine are crowded with tourists, but winter leaves the Ellicos alone with a friendly Doberman pinscher named <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> and the silent Baraga statue, shrouded in snow. Schoolchildren come out now and then to burn candles by the shrine. A state plaque nearby marks an ancient Indian trail that heads south to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. At least one missionary is believed to have died on the frozen path. This is the time of year the Ellicos, who have tended the shrine for 14 years, notice the increasing cold and dream of retiring and moving south. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> and his brother once envisioned a tourist motel and restaurant on the bluff overlooking <LOCATION> Keweenaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but his brother died and the <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baraga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> asked if he would donate land for the shrine. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellico </PERSON> agreed. Artist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s robed priest stands high on a giant metallic cloud, atop copper arches that end in five tepees, one for each of the Indian missions <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> founded. To <PERSON> Walling </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baraga </PERSON>'s own life was the greatest show of divine intervention. `` That he survived under the conditions he lived _ that was more a miracle than anything else,'' she says. `` He traveled from L'Anse to <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on snowshoes. His eyes froze shut and he survived with no harm.'' <PERSON> Walling </PERSON> has given <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> other evidence, though. From there, a Franciscan priest, <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Korosak </PERSON>, sends them on to the Sacred Congregation of Saints. `` There are over 110 very strong cases of miracles or intercessions,'' <PERSON> Walling </PERSON> says. One involved Baraga County Clerk <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, who led the effort in the early 1970s to build the <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> shrine, <PERSON> Thoren </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, who was crippled with arthritis at 28, died last year. `` He was totally invalid and then he walked,'' <PERSON> Thoren </PERSON> says. `` I believe the statue was done in 1971 in thanksgiving.'' The Catholic community has not waited for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to begin sending prayers to <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION>. The faithful carefully pass among themselves relics of his existence: thread from his woolen socks and splinters of wood from his burial casket. A Hubbell woman's cancer completely vanished after she prayed to <LOCATION> Baraga </LOCATION> with thread from his socks in her hands, <PERSON> Walling </PERSON> says. `` My mother had a thread,'' <PERSON> Thoren </PERSON> says. `` When my brother became a sky diver, she gave it to him. Then he gave it to a friend who was dying of cancer.'' The cancer victim died, but the thread was preserved, a precious token. If the miracles are accepted, Baraga's writings must be presented in a document that explains the context of his work, a process <PERSON> Walling </PERSON> says is two-thirds complete. Then the real journey begins, as the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> considers Baraga first for veneration, beatification and finally canonization.

 Holy cow! A one-man publishing house milking the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for poetry and prose and not pulling for a best-seller? Yep, and they call it just that: Holy Cow! Press. Ask the boss, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, the owner, publicity agent, production department, accountant and lone editor. `` If I really wanted to make a lot of money I'd publish cookbooks, self-help, or a lot of childrens books,'' he says. Instead, <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> focuses on the literary works of a select group of writers who explore controversial issues and experiment with ideas. He settled on Holy Cow! as a moniker for its shock value and because it reflects the Midwestern roots of his writers, most of whom are women or non-white. `` I like risk-taking,'' says <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, who works out of his rented home. `` I still think that poetry is where important new ground-breaking philosophies are going to come out.'' The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> native founded the press in 1977 between stints as a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>. In August he moved the business to <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, where his wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen-Perlman </PERSON>, works as a communications professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota-Duluth </ORGANIZATION>. The couple have three children under the age of 6. `` He's terrific,'' says <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a member of <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Villages </LOCATION> and Voices, a competing small press based in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` He's very respectful of the writer and he has a very creative image of the finished book and a wonderful knowledge of language. He puts it together.'' <PERSON> Tilsen </PERSON>'s mother, 88-year-old <PERSON> Meridel </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Seuer </PERSON>, is one of the poets and storytellers in whom <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> has taken an interest. <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> delights in her activist background, including her being blacklisted by the late Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> during the Red Scare. `` I really do n't want a best-seller,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says. `` It would take up a lot of time and I just do n't want to be famous for one book. I really want to do work with high literary standards.'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> pores over 30 to 40 manuscripts a month but packages only six to eight books a year. To avoid the foreclosure that would be certain if Holy Cow! published only poetry, <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says he is beginning to dabble in quality childrens books. Reprints of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Seuer </PERSON>'s `` Sparrow Hawk,'' a historical tale about a young American Indian, and `` The Story of <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleseed </PERSON>'' are already on the market. <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> plans to reprint other Le Seuer books about <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Odegard </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Odegard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, says Holy Cow! is one of about a dozen independent presses in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> that publish books rich in literary value. `` They fulfill a market that would n't be filled by large publishers,'' <PERSON> Odegard </PERSON> says. Reviews are important to <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> because he rarely sees monetary rewards. He says <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> once wrote in The Nation magazine that Holy Cow! was one of the best small presses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That's no small accomplishment considering the country supports between 3,000 and 4,000 independent publishers, the majority of which are run by one or two people. `` A good review, to me, says it has some value, even if it does n't sell,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, who welcomes suggestions from his authors about the design of their books, says his most disappointing experience came when he endured an abrasive, pompous writer only to have the book fail commercially and critically. He declined to be specific. `` You just do n't know how it's going to be received,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says. `` Sometimes a book just lies there acting like it's dead.'' Other times it flies. Brother Songs, a poetry anthology written by men about father-son, brother-brother and other male relationships, has sold 6,000 copies since its first printing in 1979 to become Holy Cow!'s most successful title. <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says the book is, `` One of my answers to the feminist concerns from a male point of view.'' Other Holy Cow! books in print or nearing publication are `` Star Quilt,'' a book of poems by <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON>, an American Indian studying at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>; `` Fun and Games,'' a collection of short fiction by black writer <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>, and `` The Invisible Musician,'' poems by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Young Bear, a resident of the Mesquakie tribal settlement near <LOCATION> Tama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` I found the most passion in the work of minorities,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says. `` I do n't think that many white writers can see from the top side what's going on in the culture.'' So what makes Brother Songs and other poetry by Holy Cow! good? <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says he's bullish on imagination and clarity. Subject matter is a close second. And when it's all wrapped in a binding, it better be as wholesome as fresh milk when it comes to spelling and grammar. `` That's real important to me,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says. `` Most of my creative talent goes into editing.'' If a Holy Cow! book sells for $ 10 at bookstores, <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> is likely to receive about $ 4.50 from each sale. From that he must draw his salary, pay for production and publicity and dish out royalty fees to the authors, who are paid cash advances in some cases. He's usually satisfied if a poetry book sells 1,500 copies and a book of prose 3,000 to 4,000 copies, but there are no guarantees. Because he sinks what little profit there is into the production of more books, <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says he is seeking non-profit status from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. As a non-profit enterprise, Holy Cow! would be in a better position to seek grants from tax-exempt philanthropic organizations and give <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> enough cash to hire a staffer and increase his volume to about 10 books a year. `` I'm not a capitalist pig,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> says. `` But I hope within the next year or two I can make a regular working wage.''

 <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> is at a point in his acting career where he no longer needs to do television, yet unlike many film stars he refuses to turn his back on the small screen. His latest TV appearance comes Sunday in `` Day One,'' a prestigious drama on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> about development of the atomic bomb. He's completing the feature film `` Street Legal,'' then he's off to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for stage appearances as <PERSON> Lopakhin </PERSON> in `` The Cherry Orchard. `` Most of television today is just a diversion,'' <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> says. `` I'm at a point where I'm not expected to do TV. My response is that if decent, like-minded artists do n't do TV we ca n't complain. We have a social responsibility.'' <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> says ` Day One' is a balanced look at the decision to build and drop the atomic bomb. `` It's an attempt to understand the enormous accomplishment in building that weapon in 2 -LCB- years without computers,'' he says. `` And it looks at the politics of deciding to use it. The Cold War may become a historical artifact so it's important that we understand how it started.'' <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> stars as Gen. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON>, the man who built the Pentagon and was the ramrod behind the super-secret <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rintels </PERSON> produced the three-hour drama and wrote the screenplay based on <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>'s book. The movie also stars <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strathairn </PERSON> as Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> as <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON>, with appearances by <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronyn </PERSON> as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON> as Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> <PERSON> Steirs </PERSON> as President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> as <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> on this day is at a hilltop park in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> preparing for a night's work on `` Street Legal.'' He'll soon be up to his knickers in muck as a maverick police lieutenant who stumbles upon an international political conspiracy. It's his first solo starring role in a feature film. `` I'm sweating out finishing this picture so I can get to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for rehearsals,'' he says. `` I'm probably the only guy who plays cops, jumps on a plane to rush to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to show the Russians how to play <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON> with a British director.'' <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, where he was an all-city high school football tackle and played the title role in a senior class production of `` Macbeth.'' He got a degree in history at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, then spent five years in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, including eight months in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Afterward, he worked at a variety of jobs while honing his skills in off-off-Broadway plays. He made his film debut in `` Semi-Tough'' in 1977, followed with roles in `` Looking for Mr. <PERSON> Goodbar </PERSON>,'' `` Foul Play,'' `` F.I.S.T.,'' `` <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> and Sundance: The Early Years'' and `` 10.'' Among his later roles: `` Gorky Park,'' `` Best Seller,'' `` Silverado,'' `` Legal Eagles,'' `` Cocoon'' and `` F-X.'' <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON>, who has three daughters from an earlier marriage, recently married <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnott </PERSON>, an Australian costumer designer he met while doing `` Return To Snowy River.'' One daughter, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, is in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> soap opera `` The Guiding Light.'' She bears a striking resemblance to <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, and since `` Fatal Attraction'' she has had some difficulty being cast in commercials. Another daughter, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, is also an actress and has a small role in `` Street Legal.'' His third daughter, <PERSON> Deidre </PERSON>, attends medical school in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> starred in two TV series, `` Big Shamus, Little Shamus'' and `` Star in the Family.'' He was in the miniseries `` Pearl'' and his most recent TV appearance was as a bounty hunter on an episode of `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' under consideration as a spinoff series. `` I'm at the point where I can do what I want,'' he says. `` I want to do good things. The tragedy of television is that there's so little that is good. But the networks are in trouble and they're turning back to creative people. Back on the subject of his character in `` Day One,'' <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> says, `` Groves is a fascinating guy. He believed in his country, he believed in accomplishments, he believed in the work ethic. He was n't a very sophisticated man. He was the one man with the extraordinary mind, intellect, discipline, leadership and ambition to accomplish the task of building the bomb. `` People now tend to look at <LOCATION> Oppenheimer </LOCATION> as a Hamlet, who was never certain about the bomb. Once the deed was done and the bomb was dropped, <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> was a man who could not help but examine what he did and feel a terrible guilt. Groves, on the other hand, never doubted that it was necessary to save <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives.''

 Backstage at the American Conservatory Theater, <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> takes a pull on a cigarette and ponders the differences between regional theater and <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` One is about the work, and the other is about money,'' says the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. `` Broadway and Broadway producers could care less about the work, about the content of the work.'' `` Their concern is ` How are we going to get people into the theater to see whatever it is?' It could be the worst thing imaginable ... That's the way the producers think.'' He allows that there are some `` happy coincidences'' when quality and profit overlap. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play `` Fences'' enjoyed a successful Broadway run and won a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Drama Critics Circle Award and a Tony. He won another Critics Circle award for `` <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>'s Black Bottom,'' which ran for six months but did n't make a profit. A third Broadway show, `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone,'' closed at a loss after a brief run. Those three plays are part of a cycle of 10 works <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is writing about the black experience during each decade of the 20th century. It was ACT's production of `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'' that brought <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and he liked what he saw in a cast led by <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is in the enviable position of having many offers from many quarters. He has just completed the first draft of his play about the 1960s, tentatively titled `` Two Trains Running,'' and is working on the screenplay for `` Fences.'' He also has plans for some short stories, a mystery novel, more poetry and a performance piece called `` Seven Guitars'' that he says will diverge from his more traditionally structured plays. All this work flows from a man who grew up on the poor side of town, dropped out of school in ninth grade, worked at odd jobs and got started as a writer by jotting down lines in restaurants and bars. But it is that background that makes <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> what he is: a keen observer of the sweat, grit, pain and injustice that marks life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s underclass. Although his father `` had a presence in the household,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was raised by his mother in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, a melting pot of Jews and Syrians, blacks and whites where he shared two rooms with three sisters and two brothers. His first poems were written anonymously in the seventh grade to a pretty classmate named <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>. `` I would write these poems and leave them on her desk,'' he says. That lasted until <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> took up with a boy named <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>. `` I always figured that she thought <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was the one writing the poems.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s loss was the world's gain as <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> continued to write poetry. Some were published in anthologies, and the author found he `` could always pick up a few dollars reading some poems here and there.'' But mostly he worked odd jobs. Terrible jobs. For some terrible bosses. `` One time I was an elevator. I was not an elevator operator. I was the elevator. A men's clothing store was on the third floor and my job consisted of running from the first floor to the third floor when anyone came in -LRB- to pick something up -RRB-. They had three tailors up there, so they stayed pretty busy. `` I did n't mind because I would read until someone came in.'' In 1968, as black Americans were debating the character of their culture and looking for ways to change their role in society, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> felt a need to contribute as an artist and, with a friend, founded the Black Horizon Theater. He knew nothing of theater at the time. `` So the first thing I did was to go to the library and find a book on how to direct a play. `` Since we had a theater, I ran right home and said ` Let me write a play.' Well, I sat down and wrote a play and the characters did not talk. And I said, ` Well, this playwriting business is not for me.''' He wrote a few one-act plays, then went back to poetry. To this day, he says he's familiar with only one play by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and one by <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>. He has never seen a play by <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> or <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>. `` I've never read ` Raisin In The Sun,' either. I saw the movie.'' The foundation of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s writing, he says, is the blues. `` The reason I'm able to do what I do is because all the ideas and characters come out of the blues. I listen to the music, which I see as a cultural response of an entire people to the world that they find themselves in.'' In 1978, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and got a job writing scripts for its science museum. An actress from the museum invited him to see a play, and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> came away thinking he could do it better. That gave birth to `` Jitneys,'' a play about gypsy cab drivers in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` That was the first realistic play I wrote.'' It was also the start of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s 20th century cycle. `` Jitneys'' was set in 1971. `` Fullerton Street,'' set in 1941, followed `` because I wanted to write about the clash of the rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the urban North.'' `` After that, I wrote ` <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>'s Black Bottom,' which was set in 1927. And I felt, why do n't I just continue to do this. And then ` Fences' was the'50s.'' `` Joe Turner'' was set in 1911. `` Piano Lesson'' takes place in 1936. His intent in `` Two Trains Running,'' which takes place in the 1960s, is to show the relationship of blacks to the rest of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society. `` Once I had that as my focus, I discovered the relationship was not very much unlike that of a slave community back during slavery. Although there is freedom and the Emancipation Proclamation, a lot of the relationships still exist. And so I thought I could show that relationship and the real problem. `` The real problem in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the labor problem. That's why blacks were brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as a labor system. Which is ironic. At one time, all blacks were working. And now nobody's working.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Once banned by the Russian czars, the balalaika is the most beloved musical instrument in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now a Soviet orchestra on a tour of 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities is introducing Americans to the sound produced by an instrument which is something like a guitar, but with some big differences.

 There may be some Scots who ca n't bear the bagpipe, but it's a rare Russian who bad-mouths the balalaika. `` The balalaika is the instrument most close to the Russian soul,'' says <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON>, one of the 82 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Osipov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balalaika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, which is on a tour of 40 American cities through March 9. `` It is very tender, very touching. It starts singing in the hands of a real master.'' What's a balalaika? Well, it's a stringed instrument somewhat like a guiter, but is triangular shaped, usually has only three strings, and comes in a variety of sizes. Americans may remember the sound from `` <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>'s Theme,'' on the sound track of the film `` Dr. Zhivago.'' <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON> plays the domra, which looks like a round-bodied banjo, its flat front the size of a dinner plate. Many balalaikas sound best, apparently, mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra. <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON> and other members of the <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top balalaika orchestra, were interviewed through an interpreter. `` We're doing all kinds of songs _ sad and merry. They all depict the state of a soul,'' says <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, the orchestra's conductor and artistic director `` There are really rhythmic, energetic songs. You want to dance when you hear them,'' adds singer <PERSON> Nadja </PERSON> <PERSON> Babkina </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Babkina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION>, which is on tour with the orchestra. Miss <PERSON> Babkina </PERSON>, who wears her long hair dramatically forward over one shoulder, says that in the 16th century, balalaika players were dispersed and their instruments were burned because they were thought to be diverting people's attention from the church. `` That's why a law was signed by our czar that all these groups of amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also,'' she says. `` Russian people tried to hide these instruments. In the 18th century someone said it was time to renew them.'' `` Why do n't you ask how to play it?'' asks <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 41, holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a man named <PERSON> Nalimov </PERSON>, the Stradivarius of balalaika makers. Then he demonstrates, drawing his right index finger across the strings like a violin bow. `` It is such a strong finger, he can even open a bottle,'' says <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Butushin </PERSON>, who plays an array of horns that he has made, some with bells made of cows' horns. `` I go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly their horns,'' Butushin says. `` We have several such places in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' The balalaika, used mainly for playing folk music, is more popular in rural areas, but it is not unknown in the cities. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Byeloblotsky </PERSON>, 38, playing some jazz riffs on his bass balalaika, says he was born in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and heard the balalaika as a child. `` I started playing contrabass, like in the symphony orchestra,'' he says. `` Then I was very fond of jazz and I played in a jazz orchestra which went away from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and now is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now I'm playing this bass balalaika and I'm really very happy. I think that is the thing I wanted to do.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who plays `` prima balalaika,'' the main one of the five sizes of balalaikas in the <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> orchestra, started on the accordion, like his father. `` I joined music school when I was 15 years old,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says. `` I heard balalaika and I liked very much the sound and I started seriously studying this instrument. I was born in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but my relatives came from villages.'' Conductor <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> explains that orchestra members and aspiring members alike must audition each year. Seniority does n't count. `` If somebody proves not so good, he retires,'' he says. Accordion player <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Konovalov </PERSON> says, `` I was born in 1941, when the Germans were very close to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the Second World War. My mother went to a village and I was born with an accordion in my hands. At that time, in villages, it was the most popular instrument. At night, people came out of their homes and sat on benches and started playing. `` I started playing the gormoyan, which is a purely Russian accordion, when I was 12.'' <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, 45, the orchestra conductor for 10 years, was once a professional singer. His wife plays domra in the orchestra. The youngest of their three children, now 5, waved his hands like a conductor _ `` by a kind of inheritance,'' his father says _ before he could talk. Butushin, whose interest in horns crowded out his earlier balalaika playing, has been in the orchestra for 20 years, since he was 15, and has been on all its American tours _ in 1969,'71 and'77. <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON>, 31, started out playing the cello as a boy in music school. `` I was so small and the cello was so big and heavy, I thought it was better if I played this domra,'' he says. `` Since then I deeply love this instrument.'' `` This domra player is the best in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> says. `` He's concert master in the orchestra. He treats his domra like a beloved woman.'' <PERSON> Lukin </PERSON>'s wife also plays domra in the <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> orchestra and in the American concerts they play a duet, which they encore with a <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> rag. The <LOCATION> Osipov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balalaika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s biggest and best, conductor <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> says. `` It was founded by <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> in 1919, consisting of eight players.'' <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> says. `` He dressed the balalaika in a tuxedo.'' Conductor <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipov </PERSON> later added other instruments and commissioned composers. After his death in 1946, the orchestra was named for him. The sound caught on outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> adds. `` After <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> led a tour, balalaika orchestras were formed in countries all over the world.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the principal of <ORGANIZATION> Eastside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, decided that a baseball bat was as good an educational tool as books. His controversial tactics are the focus of the new <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> film `` Lean on Me.'' The movie is reviewed this week by education writer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, who has covered the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> controversy, and film critic <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, in side-by-side reviews.

 Anyone who has ever met <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the principal of <ORGANIZATION> Eastside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, knows that he would never allow a film crew into his school unless for the greater glory of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. This is, after all, the same <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> who in 1987 virtually barred a state monitoring team from inspecting his building. So it's hardly a surprise that `` Lean on Me,'' a new <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> film shot on location at <LOCATION> Eastside </LOCATION> and purporting to be based on the `` true story'' of the tough principal, turns out to be little more than blackboard jungle propaganda aimed at vindicating <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s bat-and-bullhorn educational methods <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> has sunk a long way since last April when it made its commendable foray into the school world with the vastly superior `` Stand and Deliver,'' a film with twice the plot and a hundred times more character development than this latest. `` Stand and Deliver'' was about a high school math teacher in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> barrio school who proved that inner city kids respond to the same kinds of positive things that rich kids do: adults who really care. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, by contrast, captured headlines in recent years as the principal who restored order to an inner-city school described by local prosecutors as a `` cauldron of violence.'' In the seven years <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has run Eastside, he has indeed tamed this once graffiti-scarred school. His methods shocked some, but pleased many others, including then-U.S. Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> whose frequent praise helped make <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> a national celebrity. He prowled the hallways with a baseball bat and bullhorn, suspended hundreds of students, and made it clear to all that the sign in his office, `` One Way: My way'' _ applied to teachers and students alike. `` Lean on Me'' paints <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> as a principal who bleeds for his kids, but will stop at nothing, including breaking labor and fire laws, cursing out his superiors, and humiliating teachers, to achieve his aims. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> won headlines as a black educator who blamed his school's problems on a failed social welfare system Hardly have the opening credits finished rolling before the film has made sure no one has missed any of these points. It opens with a brief shot of Eastside High in more idyllic days. In 1967, the school was mostly white; boys wore ties. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, then a young teacher, wore a dashiki. Twenty years later, we see a very different Eastside, with graffiti covering anything standing still long enough to be spray-painted, girls openly molested, drugs freely dispensed, fights commonplace. Into the breach steps <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. His challenge: brush aside the small-minded politicians and school board, restore order, and raise standardized test scores quickly enough to avoid a state takeover of the school. Hey, no sweat. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> turns in a credible performance as <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, capturing nicely <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s self-righteousness. The script by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffer </PERSON> does n't leave much room for character development, but that was n't the point of this film, anyway. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> himself had this to say of <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> as filming proceeded last June: `` He's a good actor but I do n't think anybody can fully portray me. There's only one <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>.'' How true. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> Education Writer.

 If any critics' organization offered an award for The Most Manipulative Director, the Lifetime Achievement Award would surely go to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Avildsen </PERSON>. Consider his ability to rouse audiences to anger, revulsion and especially, the overwhelming joy of victory over impossible odds in such films as `` Joe,'' `` Save the Tiger,'' `` Rocky,'' `` Neighbors'' and `` The Karate Kid.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release, `` Lean on Me,'' is quintessential <PERSON> Avildsen </PERSON>. From the very first frame, he grabs the viewers and plays their emotions with the skill of a disc jockey at a disco turntable. You cheer and weep tears of joy despite the realization that you are being shamelessly used. The film is based on the headline-making career of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the black educator who turned the <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> from a ghetto jungle into a model of achievement, wielding a symbolic baseball bat. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffer </PERSON>'s script obviously takes liberties with the facts, since it is orchestrated in a series of audience-stirring sequences. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> -RRB- is a zealous teacher whose fierce temper and outspokenness has relegated him to being principal of a white grammar school. When Eastside High is threatened with a takeover by the state because of a dismal academic record, the mayor -LRB- <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> -RRB- and school superintendent -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> -RRB- reluctantly enlist <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> as Eastside principal. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> begins by ousting all the drug dealers and goof-offs, painting over the graffiti, and haranguing both students and teachers. He goes overboard, alienating his staff and making an enemy of a power-hungry activist -LRB- <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> is jailed for locking the school doors -LRB- to keep out drug dealers -RRB-, but you can guess who triumphs in the end. <PERSON> Schiffer </PERSON>, who also wrote the slambang `` Colors,'' has provided a messy screenplay, overloaded with shouted speeches and offering an improbably sentimental climax that would make <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> seem like <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>. But for those willing to leave cynicism at home, `` Lean on Me'' can be a moving experience, thanks in large part to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s powerful presence. He is a marvel of raw energy commanding force. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> has the relatively thankless role of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s long-suffering assistant but she performs admirably The students are uniformly great. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> produced the film which is rated PG-13, mostly for language and violent action. Refreshingly, the film makes little use of expletives, which might have abounded in such a film. Running time: 104 minutes. _ By <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Poltergeist III'' -LRB- MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. PG-13 -RRB- `` Poltergeist III'' should have had all the flaws of its predecessors _ cubed _ in the negative exponential fashion of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> sequels. It does n't. It's excellent. -LRB- Sadly, it was the last film for child star <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, who died during surgery after the movie's theatrical release. -RRB- In this episode, the spirit world's demonic preacher <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB- is again determined to get <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> -RRB- to guide him `` into the light'' on the Other Side again. No problem; you would n't have it any other way. <PERSON> Tangina </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Zelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> -RRB-, the chubby little medium from `` I'' and `` II'' returns to help <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, along with the doughty <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who play <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s devoted uncle and aunt. <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> is the manager of a sleek, mirrored high-rise building, the all-too familiar `` complex of shops, offices and apartments.'' So ... what if ... the evil spirit moves into the building? Why, it's ... an Eighties nightmare!!! The building becomes a stunning, surreal maze of endless-seeming stairwells, filled with mirrored walls with spectral images, with crazy elevators that go crazy and demonic cars in a frozen parking garage. Note that all the special effects were shot on-camera. Some of them are ingenious and utterly simple _ and awfully scary. Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> could n't get all the originals' stars and could n't afford the costly opticals and other lab effects, so he and co-writer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> went after something different and succeeded brilliantly.

 `` A Fish Called Wanda'' -LRB- CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated R -RRB- One of the biggest box-office surprises of the season was `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>,'' a juicy jewel heist romp starring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clease </PERSON> -LRB- who also wrote the screenplay -RRB- and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> of `` Monty Python'' fame, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>. `` Wanda'' is the type of comedy we long to see but only get once every decade. It's wacky, sophisticated, obvious, raunchy, irreverent, delicious and a laugh a minute. <PERSON> George </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgeson </PERSON> -RRB-, Otto -LRB- <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Palin </PERSON> -RRB- pull a diamond heist and immediately set to double-triple cross each other. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> set up <PERSON> George </PERSON> and get him arrested for the crime. But before the cops take him off in cuffs, he hides the key to the safety deposit box in which the gems are hidden in <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>'s fish food. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> finds the key and hides it in the treasure box in his beloved fish tank where his prize fish is an angel also named <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>. Stay tuned for a tragic scene later in the movie featuring little <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>. The only witness who can place <PERSON> George </PERSON> near the scene of the crime is a little old lady who owns three tiny dogs. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> decides to kill her so she wo n't be able to testify. He misses three times. Go figure. But the bit, as cruel and crazy as it is, is also one of the funniest running gags on film. <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> is <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s defense counsel, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leech </PERSON>. -LRB- Another gag for film buffs. -RRB- <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> decides to seduce <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> in order to learn where <PERSON> George </PERSON> has hidden the loot. Only problem, she falls in love with him. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, her true love, a maniacal former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative who will just about kill anyone who calls him `` stupid,'' keeps close watch on <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> _ like in putting stethoscopes to windows while they attempt to make love inside. <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> is brilliant as <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, who fancies himself an intellectual because he reads <PERSON> Nietzsche </PERSON>. -LRB- But, as <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> tells him, calling him stupid is an insult to stupid people. -RRB- He prances, storms, postures and leaps in and out of the type of character <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> made institutional as <ORGANIZATION> Basil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fawlty </ORGANIZATION> in `` Fawlty Towers.'' <PERSON> Palin </PERSON>, as the animal-loving stutterer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>, is a delight. <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> plays it pretty straight this time, but gets big laughs for his Russian striptease and for the scene in which his wife comes home just a little too early while <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> is there. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, however, is the weak link in an otherwise sprightly flick. She has no timing for comedy. She's fortunate, though, in having a superb cast to keep her afloat. Do n't rent `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>.'' Buy it. This is a video to see again, and again and again. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Honky Tonk Angel'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveless </PERSON> <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveless </PERSON>' crystal clear voice lends a subtle, rather than overpowering, quality to her music. So `` <PERSON> Honky </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonk </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON>,'' her third album, does n't score an immediate knockout. But it's an enjoyable, if not spectacular, record that sounds better with repeated listening. Loveless works in the same musical territory as such hip country traditionalists as <PERSON> Emmylou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>. She's at her best, however, with the pop-leaning ballads `` If You Think'' and `` I'm on Your Side.'' Also worth hearing is her rendition of the great `` Do n't Toss Us Away.'' Her version, with backround vocals by <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, is more understated than the Lone Justice original but no less powerful as Loveless makes a plea for keeping a romance alive even as all around `` it seems like everyone we've known, their love's grown cold.'' Loveless' band, featuring fiddler <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and the always impressive <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> on guitar, is solid throughout on an album that _ sort of like a good concert opening act _ gives the sense of hearing an artist who may have something great in her future. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Symphonies No. 24, 26, 27 and 30 by <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Amadeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, conducted by Sir <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackerras </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Telarc </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- For listeners not enchanted with performances on original instruments but who want fresh-sounding, more authentic versions of pre-20th century works, there is a middle course. Sir <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackerras </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> take it in this Telarc recording of four middle symphonies by the 17-year-old <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>. The orchestra is scaled back, a harpsichord added and the style of playing is that of original instrument recordings, though the instruments are modern. The strings make more biting attacks and lean into the beginning of notes, and the flutes and oboes leave out vibrato. The sound is brisk and lean and full of life, and the musicians play with a controlled exuberance. There is a little too much echo to the sound, a result probably of the recording site, the Castle of <LOCATION> Dobris </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mackerras </PERSON> sometimes lets things move along a little too briskly, though there are loving moments, especially in the masterful slow movement of No. 27, perhaps the best part of the disc. The main theme is a descending string passage capped by plucked notes in the cello, which become their own counter theme in the next section. As <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloch </PERSON>'s fine linear notes point out, these symphonies are numbered out of chronological order: Nos. 26 and 27 were written before <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s July-September 1773 visit to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and Nos. 24 and 30 after. Oddly, No. 24 sounds the earliest, with its simple descending three-chord main theme in the first movement. No. 26 sounds the most operatic, and was indeed used as an overture to a play. No. 30 is full of humor, a light-hearted romp in the opening Molto Allegro movement, followed by a stately Andantino, Menuetto and Haydenesque surprise ending in the final Presto. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> trip was <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s third to the European music capital. As a 7-year-old prodigy, he jumped into the lap of Empress <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> and gave her a kiss for her praise. The next time, he got a gold watch. In 1773, he got another audience _ but not the court appointment he had hoped for. The empress in a letter compared the ever-touring genius to a traveling beggar. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 It could have been an actor's nightmare: starring in a movie while the man you're portraying is always there, peeping over your shoulder. But for <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, the results were great. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, who received an Academy Award nomination last year for his supporting role as the terrifying pimp in `` Street Smart,'' is the star of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>' `` Lean on Me.'' He plays the role of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> principal who turned a drug-ridden wasteland into a model high school with the symbolic weapons of a baseball bat and a bullhorn. Not only is <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> alive and functioning at Eastside High in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>. He was also present while `` Lean on Me'' was being shot at Eastside. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> was there before we started,'' says <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. `` Since we filmed in the school and school was in session, he was there every day, doing his job. `` You want to know if that was daunting? Yes. Incredibly daunting the first week and a half or two. I did n't know how I was going to do it.'' How much of the performance is <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> and how much is <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>? `` All of the performance is <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>,'' he replied. `` What <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> could bring in the way of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was largely due to <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. He was very available to me, extremely helpful, very supportive. He made it easy, despite my own sense of inadequacy.'' But <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> still had to create a character, not merely imitate <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` That's what I lost sight of,'' he admitted. `` I went into this watching him and thinking, ` I got to be <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>,' rather than, ` I've got to give a performance.' I had to straighten myself out on that. It was like trying to make a Studebaker look like a Buick.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was pleased to report that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has seen the film and has given his seal of approval. `` That's the seal that counts,'' said <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. `` I really wanted him to like the movie. I like him a lot.'' Not everyone agrees. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was tagged `` Crazy Joe'' because of some of his tactics, including the chaining of school exit doors to keep out drug dealers. Or his initial act of expelling 300 under-achieving and trouble-making pupils. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, however, dismisses <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s critics. `` He is universally beloved by his students, and that's all that counts. People who disagree with him are meaningless. They're off in some kind of ivory tower; I do n't think they even know what he did.'' Some might argue that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has been operating a fascist state. `` So what?'' answers <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. `` What do you think a school is? It's not a democracy. You ca n't teach democracy if you ca n't catch the attention of the students. No school I ever went to was -LRB- a democracy -RRB-.'' His schools were in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, an area not unlike <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> had been born in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, but his family moved north when he was young. He remembers school as being much more orderly than what <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> faces. `` The streets were what I had to negotiate; the schools were not a problem,'' he remarked. `` Once you got through the doors of school, you were safe. There the teachers had control. `` What -LRB- ` Lean on Me' -RRB- represents is what happened to schools, particularly in the inner cities, in the'60s and'70s. The schools were taken over by the students, and the teachers were shortchanged. Their caseloads and classrooms were entirely too large. Their ability to discipline miscreants was undermined by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings about corporal punishment in schools. And their salaries were so low that they became second-class citizens.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> first fell in love with acting in the third grade, when he portrayed <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> in a class pageant. In the seventh grade he won the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> state prize as best actor in a drama contest. But his real ambition was to become a `` hotshot pilot with a scarf around my neck and strafe the enemy's flag.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> he became a radar technician instead. After his discharge he realized what he really wanted to do was act, and he enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to learn the basics. His first professional job was dancing at the 1964 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair, then he joined a touring company of `` The Royal Hunt of the Sun.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> managed to earn a living in plays such as `` Hello, Dolly'' -LRB- with <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cab </PERSON> <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> -RRB- and `` Purlie'' and in TV shows such as <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>.'' Then in 1980 the jobs inexplicably stopped. He still does n't know why, except maybe he was too outspoken in rejecting material he deemed substandard. The drought lasted two years, and he credits <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> with helping him get work again, casting him in a film. The big breakthrough came with `` Street Smart.'' `` I always wanted to play a pimp,'' he admitted, `` and this guy was real.'' Critics thought so. <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kael </PERSON> even theorized in The New Yorker: `` Is <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> the greatest American Actor?'' `` Street Smart,'' which starred <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>, was released early in 1987 to so-so business. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s achievement might have faded from view except that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> critic <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> suggested to <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwit </PERSON> that his performance deserved an Oscar campaign. His reaction to the Academy nomination? `` I felt fine. It was like having a pat on the back and ` Well done.' You sort of kick the dirt and say, ` Aw gee, thanks' -LRB- laughing -RRB- and try to hold onto your sense of self and not go off flying half-cocked It's just a pat on the back.''

 Before <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s painting of the <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on a traveling show for the National Gallery 16 months ago, the trunk had been at the bottom and the branches at the top. Now it's going back to the <LOCATION> Wadsworth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atheneum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> with the tree standing on its head. Curators say `` on its head'' is what the artist intended when she painted the towering pine at author <PERSON> D.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s ranch north of <ORGANIZATION> Taos </ORGANIZATION> 60 years ago, but one of them adds that the National Gallery's decision to show it that way has caused `` a firestorm of controversy. In her last 10 years, <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> chose at least three times to show the tree upright _ on a poster, in a television documentary and in a book of her collected works. The <PERSON> Wadsworth </PERSON> similarly displayed it reaching upward toward a starlit sky. But her final intentions were never made clear. <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>, who had lived near <LOCATION> Abiquiu </LOCATION> since 1940, died in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> in 1986 at the age of 98. `` I warned the curators at the National Gallery that this would become a subject of discussion. Of course, if <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> were alive, one word would clarify it,'' says <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a fellow <LOCATION> Abiquiu </LOCATION> artist who was <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s helper and confidant during her last 13 years. The Viking Press and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> say her 1976 book version was intentional. `` O'Keeffe went over every one of the plates. She approved everything,'' says Viking executive editor <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaill </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> also displayed the painting with the tree upright on a WNET-TV PBS documentary in 1977. In 1981, she gave the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> the right to use the painting on a poster, again indicating a preference for the upright tree, and the festival last month reprinted 5,000 copies showing it that way. `` This was the agreed-upon orientation for our poster,'' festival marketing director <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharek </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON>, curator of American painting at the <PERSON> Wadsworth </PERSON>, says the artist left the question of how to hang the work up to the gallery when the <PERSON> Wadsworth </PERSON> acquired it in 1979. `` She said she looked at the tree from several directions and several ways, and she felt that the painting could be hung from any direction,'' <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Wadsworth </PERSON> chose to hang it with the tree reaching toward the top edge of the canvas. But <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> is convinced that the National Gallery research is correct, and from now on the <PERSON> Wadsworth </PERSON> will show the painting with the tree pointing toward the bottom. In a 1929 letter to <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Strand </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> wrote of her four-month trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, including a visit to the Lawrence ranch: `` I also got a painting of the big pine tree as you see it lying on that table under it at night. It looks as though it is standing on its head with all the stars around _ pretty good _ for me.'' In a 1931 letter to art critic <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> remarked that a picture of the painting in an art magazine lost the point by showing it `` standing on its ear. ... That tree should stand on its head.'' Photos of a 1931 exhibition show the tree inverted as well. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> says the artist `` was a little more flexible than some of the viewers of this work,'' and either way may be considered correct today. `` She was a person involved in change. She was n't a stagnant person,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> says. `` If she was hanging a show, she would allow herself to do something similar'' and hang a painting differently. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON>, curator of 20th century art at the National Gallery in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, agrees <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> was not wedded to first decisions about her work. `` We do n't mean to bind her to the prior decision, but we would think ... that the 1930s decision had a greater pertinence to the original inspiration,'' he said. <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> cited `` the inverse visual logic that the artist had in the'30s.'' Other O'Keeffe paintings could be hung in multiple directions, including the 1929 <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollyhock </PERSON> painted at <ORGANIZATION> Mabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luhan </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Taos </LOCATION> adobe. Despite the documentation, <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> says the decision to show the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> in its original orientation touched off `` a firestorm of controversy.'' `` We've been dealing with it since the exhibition opened. They think they've caught us in a mistake. ... We did n't realize that the Viking book would have such an indelible impact on the public's memory. The National Gallery tour was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s birth and should honor her creative intent, <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> says. `` This -LRB- inversion -RRB- was not a caprice or whimsy. It was out of reverence to the piece. `` And from here on, it's a tossup,'' he added with a laugh. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> says <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> would have gotten a laugh out of it, too. `` Probably nothing would have amused Miss O'Keeffe more than people worrying about whether her painting was right side up or right side down,'' says <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, one of three co-personal representatives of the O'Keeffe estate and co-curator of the National Gallery show. The traveling exhibition closed Feb. 5 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The show also visited <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> after opening in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November 1987. It now heads for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for a March 31 opening. However, the <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON> wo n't be included in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> visit, which was tacked onto the schedule as an afterthought. The painting returns to the <LOCATION> Wadsworth </LOCATION>, because the owners felt it had been away long enough.

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Focus Is On Life for Lola Falana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than a year after a mysterious debilitating illness placed her career on hold, entertainer <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Falana </PERSON> says living has replaced the stage as her No. 1 priority. After a lifetime in the spotlight, one brush with death and a second illness that left her partially paralyzed, <PERSON> Falana </PERSON>, 46, has turned her back to the entertainment grind that has dominated her personal and professional life. `` I want my life back,'' she said in a recent interview in her apartment overlooking the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> where she performed for more than two decades. `` The demands of my career had become very draining, very depressing. I wo n't lock myself in again so that I have no space to dream. I'm not rushing back to that kind of world.'' <PERSON> Falana </PERSON> nearly died in 1983 when she suffered peritonitis following abdominal surgery. In November 1987 she was diagnosed by doctors in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as having multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease that short circuits the central nervous system. Her sizzling dance routines, a trademark since she wowed Broadway in `` Golden Boy'' with <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the 1960s, had been stilled in the summer of 1987 when she found her strength sapped by the illness. She and her long-time manager, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenk </PERSON>, agree she will never dance again. And she says she'll never go back to life on the road. She does n't have the heart or the health. `` I spent a good part of my life in airports, sleeping on planes. How chic is that?'' She has n't dismissed the idea of performing in her hometown of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on a limited basis, but wants nothing more to do the hassle of the road. `` I'm learning to hear my body,'' she says. `` Stress is the main factor in all diseases. I need calm. The whole world is hurry up. Well, excuse me, but I do n't want to play. I've matured into understanding what is important for my health. `` Since I was 14 I've been on every circuit of nightclub there is. And if I've missed one, I do n't want to see it. What is there to dedicate your career to? One more dressing room that you find in the basement of a building? `` Whatever triggered this, I'm not going to let it happen to me again. `` I just got a second chance to learn how to live,'' she said, her voice rising. `` I'm in charge. When you get a second chance at life, you'd be amazed at how wide awake you become. Longtime friends such as <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> have encouraged her to follow her heart, mind her health, but not close the door on her career. `` They say, ` You ca n't give up your gift.' But they also tell me it's important that I get well.'' `` In her mind, she does n't want to perform again,'' <PERSON> Schenk </PERSON> said. `` The dancing is gone. She'll never do that again.'' <PERSON> Schenk </PERSON> believes the stenuous dance routines that were a <PERSON> Falana </PERSON> trademark helped accentuate her problem 15 months ago. <PERSON> Falana </PERSON> believes she is totally recovered from the disease. Her health grew progressively worse in the summer and fall of 1987. `` The last performance I did was the worst I ever did,'' she recalled of an engagement in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in August 1987. `` I could n't feel my left foot touch the floor. I had no rhythm in my left leg. My vocal chords were collapsing. Everything was flat. There was no <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> on stage. `` I was afraid to stray away from the piano because I needed it for support. It was a scared person up there. I could n't switch the mike from one hand to the other. I do n't even remember the show except thinking ` How can I get off the stage.''' By that fall, she was bedridden. She moved to an apartment after falling down the stairs at her home. By Nov. 2 the left side of her body was paralyzed. `` I could n't move my arm or leg,'' she recalled. Determined to lick the paralysis and the gloomy outlook of her doctors, she said she began climbing small mountains _ propping herself up on an elbow, grabbing a bed railing to try and sit up. `` Something inside was telling me, ` You're not as helpless as you think.''' By the 15th day after her diagnosis she decided to go to a shopping mall. `` I had a limp, a little drag in my left leg,'' she recalled. `` If I walked slowly, it would look like I was just shopping, just strolling. If someone noticed, I kissed it off by saying I had stubbed my toe.'' After five months of therapy she was able to raise her left arm over her head. Now she wants to spend her time letting others know that faith in God can sometimes be a miraculous medicine. Beneath the pizzazz of show business is a fickle streak that leaves her cold. `` I've seen people get every imaginable accolade. But if they get one day older than the world thinks they should be, they drop them like they have no talent at all,'' she said. `` Show business is not the master to follow. It does not love you back. It takes what it needs, and if you can get your share out of it, good for you. If not, too bad, goodbye. `` Some of the greatest actors and actresses in the world are sitting in a home someplace and ca n't even get a job to buy food with dignity.'' What's ahead for <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Falana </PERSON>? `` I'm planning on being healthy, being well, meeting a marvelous gentleman someday, settling down, being his wife. `` Now that I've seen all the games, all the glitter, all the illusions, I'm ready for the real things in life _ human relations.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Writing Memoir A Humbling Experience</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Who the heck is <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> to be writing his memoirs? That's the question that <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, an award-winning short story writer whose name elicits admiration in literary circles but blank looks outside of them, pondered in a recent interview. It's a query he's fielded a lot lately, with the publication of `` This Boy's Life: A Memoir'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Monthly Press: $ 18.95 -RRB-, and it makes him a little defensive. `` These are not my memoirs in the sense of Famous People I Have Known or Wonderful Places I Have Been; it's an account of what it's like to come of age in this country,'' said the author, citing <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>'s `` Stop-Time'' and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s `` Memoirs of a Catholic Girlhood'' as like works But does n't it take a kind of arrogance for a writer to decide his life is as interesting as his fiction? `` It requires, I would say, more courage than arrogance to write a memoir,'' he said. `` I think there's a certain amount of arrogance inherent in writing anything. Because what you're in essence doing is going up to complete strangers and saying, ` I'm so interesting that you're just going to have to spend $ 20 to spend three hours in my company.' `` You have to be willing to get your neck chopped off when you write a memoir. It's a kind of humbling activity rather than the other way around.'' This account of growing up in blue-collar <LOCATION> Chinook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and other rough-and-tumble locales in the 1950s has received high praise for its honest and unsentimental evocation of childhood. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, who begins the book as a 10-year-old cadging his mother into buying him souvenirs he knows she ca n't afford and ends it with his getting kicked out of prep school, has resisted all temptation to make either himself or his childhood idyllic. The youth we see in these pages -LRB- the young <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> preferred the name <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> during this period, after <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> -RRB- breaks school windows, pelts cars with eggs, sneaks the family car out on joy rides, and in an ultimate ruse, forges references and school records to get himself admitted to prep school. Much of the deliquency is a rebellion against a totalitarian stepfather, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON>, who berates and occasionally beats the boy and forces him to do demeaning tasks, such as spending weeks shucking prickly horse chestnuts that are then allowed to mold. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, 43, is the author of two short story collections, `` Back in the World'' and `` In the Garden of the North American Martyrs,'' and a novella, `` The Barracks Thief,'' which won the 1985 Pen-Faulkner award. He is also the younger brother of the novelist and former <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> critic <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, although the two grew up in separate households. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> was raised by his father on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> traveled with his mother out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>'s well-received `` The Duke of Deception'' published in 1979 was a chronicle of his father, a charismatic con artist constantly reinventing himself, a man who once fast-talked his way into an aeronautics position with a bogus resume. It is uncanny how the young <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> duplicates his father's deceptive behavior even though the elder <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> was a virtual stranger to him. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> is a nervously energetic man whose mind races far faster than his answers to an interviewer's questions, with the result that he is constantly restarting sentences or leaving them unfinished. He is dressed in jeans, a plaid shirt and Reeboks that belie his professorial status _ he has taught creative writing at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the past eight years. The author believes that it is a very powerful myth in our culture for adults to remember growing up as a magical and happy time, and that he had altered his childhood memories to fit that notion until he started working on this book. `` And then I discovered a darkness in those years that I had forgotten about, glossed over. It's like women who remember years later in analysis that their fathers abused them. You think, ` How could they go on all these years without remembering this?' But we do,'' he said. `` This Boy's Life'' ends with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> being dismissed from the prep school, being academically unprepared for the rigorous curriculum he had duped his way into, and joining the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In the interview, <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> picked up where the book leaves off, describing his duty tour in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and wandering through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> afterward. He fell in love with <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and discovered that he could attend the university even without a high school degree if he could pass the grueling entrance exams. He crammed for eight months, hiring tutors to instruct him in English literature and history, Latin and French, passed the exams and went on to graduate. He then returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, working briefly for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, where he got fired when he lazily did n't double-check an obituary that turned out to be a prank From there he went to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, got a Stegner Fellowship at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and started publishing stories. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said he has no plans to make a book out of the material of his adult self, and is currently finishing up a collection of short stories and has plans for two novels. Looking back on `` This Boy's Life,'' <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said he finds himself talking about <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> in the third person, as if he were a character he created instead of his youthful self. `` The very act of writing about him, make him something on the page, makes him different from me,'' he said. `` I find myself feeling amused at some of the things he does; I feel affection, irritation. ... I have the feelings toward him that I might have toward a son.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: ``Streets of Bakersfield'' Helps Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELK, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Homer Joy recently got a call from a woman who had once scolded him for his noisy guitar playing and singing. Joy, 43, said the former neighbor recalled the confident young musician's reply 35 years ago that she would n't yell at him after she heard his songs on the radio. The apologetic call came after his song, `` Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>,'' was nominated for a Grammy as country song of the year and <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> was nominated as songwriter of the year. Now, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> hopes the song that also helped <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> receive a Grammy nomination for country duo of the year will also help him find a record company to distribute a gospel album. It was 16 years ago that <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> wrote and recorded `` The Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>,'' about the frustration he felt while recording a `` sound-alike'' album of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> Sr. songs at <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION><LOCATION> ' </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, studio `` It just was n't what I wanted to do,'' <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> said during a recent interview. But because he was under contract with <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, he finished the project, then insisted that producer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> listen to him play a song he'd written. `` I really got kind of redneck about it,'' <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> said, but the end result was that <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> heard the song and loved it, and had Joy record it. `` The Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>'' was a Top 10 hit in 1973 for <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, a native of Heber Springs, Ark. Joy had another hit single with `` John Law'' in 1974, and <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and other big-name country singers were recording his songs. He performed on the same bill with <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> stars such as <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. The version of `` The Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>'' recorded last year by <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> hit the top of the country charts. But in the years between his version and the latest version of the song, Joy hit rock bottom. Joy said he and <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> mutually agreed to end his contract in 1976 because of `` artistic differences.'' After that, he proved unable to cope with the pressures, traveling and temptations of being a rising star. After <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> and his wife of 15 years, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, divorced in 1978, his life changed. `` I sold 4.5 million records, and then I had everything I owned in a cardboard box in 1983,'' <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> said. `` It was a real disaster.'' But the down-and-out wanderer, who as a boy would sneak out of Saturday movie matinees to sing with <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bands on streetcorners in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said he got a dose of salvation that helped him recover and gave him a new outlook on his music. `` I accepted the Lord six years ago,'' <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> remarried in June 1983, and the following year a daughter, <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON>, was born. The Joys have seven children. Along with his wife, sons <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> accompany their father on the album of gospel songs he's recording at a studio in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> `` My wife and I said a prayer a year ago, and it could n't have been more than three weeks later that <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> and Buck did -LRB- the song -RRB- on the Country Music Awards anniversary show,'' he said. Their record was released last July and hit No. 1 on Oct. 15, but <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> said that was just a start. `` I believed ` Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>' was No. 1 with a bullet, that it being No. 1 was just really the beginning of things,'' he said. `` And it's turned out to be true. `` It's been good for everybody this song has touched, and we're really thankful Our prayer was that we could have a way to finance our gospel album.'' For that project, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> picked the 10 best songs he's written since he became a Christian six years ago. They are songs he's sung in performances at missions, penitentiaries and Christian services at rodeos. `` I have n't ever written a song that is n't based on truth,'' he said, including his old songs about getting drunk or stoned, womanizing and `` all those other kind of things. But I do n't believe -LRB- in those things -RRB- now. `` There was a time when I did, and I lived like that. So now we try to live what we write now.'' Joy still enjoys playing `` secular'' music, and he says his gospel songs are n't an attempt to `` stuff the Bible down people's throats `` We just try to do what we believe in and hope it will touch people, like ` The Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>' touched a whole lot of people.'' He's well aware that the success of a song revived after 16 years does n't guarantee a good response for a new gospel album. `` This thing, with ` Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>,' will get it listened to,'' <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not ignorant, and I know that the album has to stand on its own, aside from anything else. And I believe it will.''

<HEAD>Nose Research Provides Route to Wider Knowledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists know a lot about smell. They know it weakens as we get older, it varies depending on a person's sex and ethnic background, and it involves more than just the nose. What they generally do n't know is why. `` Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back seat to the other senses, probably because we do n't live in an olfactory world. We live in a visual world; a world of sounds,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> researcher trying to determine brain function using the nose. Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the path of an odor impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work produced a `` movie,'' or series of color-enhanced pictures, showing that the brain is `` a parallel processor,'' handling many signals simultaneously _ like a supercomputer. The research may have implications for the study and treatment of brain tumors by helping differentiate between tumors and normal tissue. Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory oddities as a link between premature decline in smell and Alzheimer's disease; a protein that ferries odor molecules through the nose; the fact that half of all people between ages 65 and 80 suffer major loss in the sense of smell; and the trait peculiar to some nasal nerve cells to regenerate. `` They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this spontaneous renewal and spontaneous decay,'' <PERSON> Kauer </PERSON> said. Some of the research in the field of smell is aimed not at medical advancement but at the bottom line. In <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> heads a research and development team for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fragrances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flavors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company that produces scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by hundreds of companies around the world. Smell, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said, `` is the one sense for which the mechanism for perception is unknown.'' Scientists know how odor molecules are gathered by smell neurons but they do n't know how a few similar types of receptor cells can distinguish between thousands of different odors. Research suggests that the process of smelling involves more than the nose, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. When blindfolded, `` Most people can not discriminate a lemon from a lime or an orange from a grapefruit.'' <ORGANIZATION> IFF </ORGANIZATION> regularly brings in dozens of smell samplers, usually women, to rate and react to fragrances, with emphasis on how the fragrances can alter mood. In the process, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> has found that 10 percent and 15 percent of the subjects display a particularly acute sense of smell. At the opposite end of the spectrum are those with no sense of smell. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, took an uncommon route to this fairly common problem. Beginning in 1972 she began to experience what amounted to smell hallucinations; she thought she smelled an unpleasant odor when there was no odor present. Years of anguish and unsuccessful treatment finally led to brain sugery in which her olfactory nerve was removed, ending her hallucinations but leaving her incapable of smelling. `` It can be very dangerous,'' she said. `` I've already burnt things in the oven and I did n't know it and there are smoke alarms everywhere. But on the other hand it does n't bother me not to smell because I still sense that I'm breathing and smelling the same as you are.'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>' doctor was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smell </ORGANIZATION> and Taste Center. Patients include the aged and professionals like wine tasters, firefighters, police officers, gas company workers, inspectors and cooks whose lives and livelihoods can depend on the sense of smell. `` There have always been problems that people had and they've had no place to turn in the past,'' <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> said. `` It's a frontier of science which really has n't even been touched on.'' That's no accident, <PERSON> Kauer </PERSON> said. `` Our world does n't require it. We really do n't go out and forage for food by sniffing along the ground. That evolution took place millions of years ago.'' <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deems </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stellar </ORGANIZATION> published a report in August in the journal Neurology linking the loss of smell and Parkinson's disease. A year earlier, a similar study linked the loss of smell to Alzheimer's disease. A new area of research will try to determine if the nasal passage serves as a pathway for viruses or chemicals that contribute to those maladies, <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> said. The general subject headings scientists have explored give an idea of the scope of smell research: the influence of body tilt on the sense of smell; and the effect of mouth movement, swallowing and spitting. Studies of ethnic groups have turned up some interesting distinctions: Korean Americans appeared to have particularly acute ability to identify smells. Black Americans in one sampling had trouble with cedar and cheddar cheese. Whites had trouble with gingerbread. Native Japanese scored poorly on clove and fruit punch. Despite this mountain of research, a key question that puzzles scientists is precisely how the sense of smell works. At <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> last summer identified a carrier protein that ferries odor molecules up the nose. The discovery occurred inadvertently in a search for receptors that play a key role in distinguishing smells, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` But another possibility as to why the receptors have n't been found is that they do n't exist.'' Other factors _ sight, sound and environment, for example _ help provide the brain with cues in identifying smells, he said, but `` the fundamental discrimination is going to be in the nose.''

 A new method of wresting radioactive uranium from nature's grasp is ready for commercial use, and could put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the forefront of the $ 2 billion enrichment industry, a scientist says. `` I can get real excited about the economic incentives,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON>, an associate director of <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and program manager for development of Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation. `` But I have to confess I believe the principal reasons we want to be in the business in the long term are our energy security and our national security. We can not become dependent on foreign suppliers for yet another one of our fuels.'' Uranium-235, the form needed for bombs and nuclear reactors, comprises only about 0.7 percent of the metal in nature. To be useful, that concentration must be increased to 3 percent to 4 percent, resulting in `` enriched'' uranium. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still uses gaseous barrier diffusion, developed during World War II and since refined, to enrich uranium. The uranium is converted to a gas and pumped repeatedly through a series of ceramic filters; because U-235 is lighter than the most common isotope, U-238, it passes through. But gaseous barrier diffusion _ done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at plants in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, is costly. `` I believe the technology in our gaseous diffusion plants is the best in the world. But Mother Nature just dictated a lot of kilowatt hours for that approach,'' <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON> said. Eighty percent of the cost of gaseous barrier diffusion is the electricity, he said. `` Our expectation is that over the next decade energy prices will drive our cost up to the point where our prices are not competitive.'' The <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> plant also is awaiting cleanup of tons of radioactive waste. <LOCATION> AVLIS </LOCATION>, chosen in 1985 as the preferred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> method, makes use of the fact that the different electron energies of U-235 and U-238 absorb different colors of light. Lasers are tuned so they emit a combination of colors absorbed only by U-235 atoms, which then emit an electron, leaving the atom positively charged and capable of separation using electromagnetic fields. This process, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, is vastly more efficient than gaseous barrier diffusion or a third technique using centrifuges to spin off the lighter U-235. The centrifuge process uses less electricity but lost out to AVLIS for government sponsorship in this country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' two main competitors for the nuclear fuel market are <ORGANIZATION> URENCO </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that uses the centrifuge process, and a consortium of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that uses a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diffusion plant with a nuclear power plant dedicated to it. <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON> said he is confident AVLIS has matured to the point of commercial deployment. And maybe just in time. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> is studying a venture with <ORGANIZATION> URENCO </ORGANIZATION> to build a uranium enrichment plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using European technology. `` AVLIS has all the attributes of the kind of technology the country is looking for,'' <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON> said. `` It uses about 10 percent of the electricity of gaseous diffusion. It's very compact. And it's a high-tech endeavor. The components of AVLIS have demonstrated they would work on a commercial scale, he said. `` It's now a question of getting the engineering done to make it work cheaply, so we can compete and build a plant. I do n't have any doubt we'll get there.'' The goal is to operate an AVLIS plant to enrich uranium at half the cost of current technology. <PERSON> Merriman </PERSON> estimates a commercial AVLIS plant with an output equivalent to that of the <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> gaseous diffusion plant would cost about $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion and take eight or nine years to build. It could be built in modules and phased in as market conditions dictate, he said.

He began writing about his health problems a year before being diagnosed with arteriosclerosis. After his fourth and final amputation in 1982, for example, his wheelchair rolled backward down a ramp outside his house. Only later did he learn he needed a special chair for amputees that accounts for the imbalance. `` I was mad,'' he said. `` It made me start thinking.'' Soon afterward, the idea for a network to nurture independence was born. After several years of research and planning, The Broken Wing finally was chartered last August with headquarters at Fuls' home in suburban White Oak.

<HEAD>Nose Research Provides Route to Wider Knowledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists know a lot about smell. They know it weakens as we get older, it varies depending on a person's sex and ethnic background, and it involves more than just the nose. What they generally do n't know is why. `` Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back seat to the other senses, probably because we do n't live in an olfactory world. We live in a visual world; a world of sounds,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> researcher trying to determine brain function using the nose. Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the path of an odor impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work produced a `` movie,'' or series of color-enhanced pictures, showing that the brain is `` a parallel processor,'' handling many signals simultaneously _ like a supercomputer. The research may have implications for the study and treatment of brain tumors by helping differentiate between tumors and normal tissue. Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory oddities as a link between premature decline in smell and Alzheimer's disease; a protein that ferries odor molecules through the nose; the fact that half of all people between ages 65 and 80 suffer major loss in the sense of smell; and the trait peculiar to some nasal nerve cells to regenerate. `` They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this spontaneous renewal and spontaneous decay,'' <PERSON> Kauer </PERSON> said. Some research in the field is aimed not at medical advancement but at the bottom line. In <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> heads a research team for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fragrances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flavors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by hundreds of companies. Smell, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said, `` is the one sense for which the mechanism for perception is unknown.'' Scientists know how odor molecules are gathered by smell neurons but they do n't know how a few similar types of receptor cells can distinguish between thousands of different odors.

<HEAD>Budworm Infestation Slowing In Pacific Northwest Forests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAKER, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Adverse weather, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` search-and-destroy'' missions and its own insatiable appetite have slowed the advance of the Western spruce budworm that has spread across millions of acres this decade. `` The outbreaks are clearly on the decline,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The infestation has been `` the worst one that we have ever experienced, in terms of the extent of area defoliated and damage caused.'' The tiny brown caterpillar was first spotted in 1980 on 5,000 acres near Cove, Ore. It has spread through <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, primarily east of the Cascades, feeding on needles of fir and spruce and destroying vast numbers of `` understory'' firs growing in the shadow of mature trees. `` The effects will continue to be felt as long as 70 years out because of the effect on the growth of trees,'' <PERSON> Hadfield </PERSON> said. Adverse weather at critical developmental stages and <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> eradication efforts using chemical and biological pesticides have helped reduce the infestation. In addition, trees in areas where the budworm has been present for several years are so damaged that they ca n't sustain the insect. Budworms defoliated 2.8 million acres last year, down from 4.2 million in 1987 and from a peak 6 million in 1986. `` We ar still predicting a very extensive area of defoliation in 1989, even though the intensity of the defoliation, by and large, will be pretty light,'' <PERSON> Hadfield </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans to test a new biological pesticide, Bacillus thuringiensis, which homes in on budworms, on two plots of 1,000 and 10,000 acres in <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Medical Imaging Techniques Used to Identify Mummies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

 It took modern radiological techniques to take the wraps off two mummies at the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> and Art, demonstrating that the bodies were of a man and a woman _ and that the woman had a fake toe. The toe, possibly made of a ceramic material, may have been the woman's ticket to the afterlife, said curator <PERSON> Tammis </PERSON> <PERSON> Groft </PERSON>. Egyptians believed people had to be physically intact to enter the hereafter and attempts were often made to restore missing body parts during mummification, <PERSON> Groft </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> radiologists used standard X-rays and computed tomography scans _ which provide a computer-enhanced cross-section image of a body _ to study the mummies, one of which was only partially wrapped. That mummy was a man, as museum experts had suspected since acquiring the mummies in 1909. It may have been a priest known as Ankhefenmut who was buried in the temple of Mut at <LOCATION> Karnak </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Thebes </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Groft </PERSON> said. `` We were pretty sure the partially unwrapped mummy was a male,'' he said. `` The X-rays confirmed it, showing a male pelvis and genitalia. But the wrapped mummy remained a mystery, until we saw the X-rays.'' The radiology tests showed that both are from the 21st Egyptian dynasty, circa 1085 to 945 B.C. Both probably died of natural causes, experts theorize, since the tests did n't reveal any trauma to their bodies. It's estimated that the man died in his 50s or 60s and that the woman was about a decade younger.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope Long-Ignored Plant Will Be Rediscovered As Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wild legume that has been eaten in eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for nearly 5,000 years needs less fertilizer than potatoes and yields three times the crude protein, says a researcher who sees it as a food crop. The `` groundnut'' or `` rosary,'' Apios americana, is a small climbing vine that produces clusters of edible pea-like seed pods and tubers. It grows along sandy creek banks, through bushes and over fallen trees. `` Historically, the plant is important because ... very few crops native to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have been domesticated,'' said horticulturalist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Agricultural Experiment Station A legume, like peas, peanuts and soybeans, the groundnut produces nitrogen and so needs less fertilizer than some food plants, <PERSON> Blackmon </PERSON> said. The plant can survive frost and other conditions unsuitable for many other crops. The tubers taste like a cross between an Irish potato and a peanut when boiled, and can be used in casseroles, corn bread and stir-fry cooking. Work is just beginning on recipes and other uses for the groundnuts, which are edible but harder to produce and might be processed into flour. <PERSON> Blackmon </PERSON> has been joined by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He began sending seeds to home gardeners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 16 other countries in 1986, with mixed results. `` These were wild seeds and some of the wild seeds were just not productive,'' he said. `` A lot of times you'll have a gardener who'll be real clever and will come up with something that's productive. <PERSON> Blackmon </PERSON> is trying to develop a plant with a more compact vine and with tubers closer to the stem to facilitate mechanical harvesting. `` I think that in some places it might be very beneficial to the world food supply,'' he said. `` The thing will stay stored in the ground, -LRB- so -RRB- you do n't have to store it. You can pull it when you need it.''

<HEAD>Researchers Study Appetite Control Method Without The Risks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Overweight people could control their appetites without jangled nerves and drug dependency if a European appetite suppressant under study here for a French pharmaceutical company proves successful. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> recently completed a preliminary study of the effect of dexfenfluramine on laboratory rats fattened either by an eat-all-you-want feast of chocolate-chip cookies and sweetened milk or by surgically neutering the animals to control hormone levels. `` In either case, we end up with fat rats. They overeat and put on the human equivalent of 50 extra pounds in a few weeks,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` We then administer the drug to the rats through surgically implanted capsules. What we find is that on this drug, the rats show considerable sustained weight loss ... `` As long as they are given the drug, they keep the weight off.'' That is one drawback common to all diet drugs, he said. `` Whether it's with rats or people, as long as they are given drugs they tend to keep weight off but once they stop the drug, they gain back weight.'' Dexfenfluramine, which has been available in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for several years, has several advantages over more traditional diet drugs, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. It `` does not have any stimulant properties; if anything, one side effect is mild sedation. Because of that, it has absolutely no abuse potential.'' And, based on European clinical tests, the drug, which <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> is testing for the French drug company <ORGANIZATION> Servier </ORGANIZATION>, produces little of the nausea or drowsiness often associated with other appetite suppressants. `` There are many theories about how -LRB- it -RRB- works,'' he said. `` It may send a premature message to the brain that the stomach is full or it may be affecting body metabolism. My feeling is that it is working at several different levels in the body, which is fortunate because that tends to enhance its effectiveness.''

According to figures released by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, 12 of the countries supplied a total of 17.42 million barrels a day in January, slightly less than the quota of 17.51 million barrels set for them.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 137.34 billion in 1988, the government announced in a report economists said showed how far <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must go before its trade problems are solved. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that exports, led by a surge in manufactured goods, shot up a dramatic 26.8 percent last year to an all-time high of $ 322.22 billion. This increase supplied much of the economy's momentum in 1988 as factories hired more workers and expanded production facilities to meet the export demand.

 Independent oil-exporting nations are likely to agree to cut their crude production to give another boost to prices, a top <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> official predicted. `` It is in their interest to reduce the supply so that we can reach 18 -LRB- dollars a barrel -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. The 13 nations that comprise <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed in November to slash production as of Jan. 1 in an effort to raise prices to their target of $ 18 a barrel. The agreement sparked a rally that has lifted the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to about $ 16 a barrel, up as much as $ 5 from late November. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials want nations outside the cartel to join them in trimming output to spur another price pickup. Representatives of a group of independent countries were meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to discuss cuts. They met last month with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> representatives. `` There is definitely a positive sign that, not only for our interest but for their own interest, they will do something in reducing the supply,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> oil minister, said in an interview. `` The more they cut from their production, of course, the sooner we can see it in dollars a barrel,'' he said. He declined to speculate on the level of cuts the non-OPEC nations might put in place. But he said it was likely they would make an offer to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, possibly next month. One participant at the non-OPEC meeting said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Monday he was `` fairly optimistic about this meeting because we're all very friendly.'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> predicted crude prices would definitely reach $ 18 in the second half of 1989. New <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> figures, he said, show member nations complied in January with the new output accord. The agreedment set an overall ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day for the 13 nations in the first six months of this year. According to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> figures, 12 countries supplied a total of 17.42 million barrels a day in January, just under the quota of 17.51 million barrels. The cartel said figures from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> had not yet been received. That nation, however, has persistently overshot its target in the past, according to private analysts. Its current quota is 988,000 barrels a day. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said the supply figures were `` a sign that we are abiding -LRB- by -RRB- our quota.'' Private analysts estimated <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> exceeded its ceiling in January by about a million barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> said, however, it measures the quota by figuring crude production and the amount of oil put into, or taken out of, stock. Production, which it defines as the amount of crude measured at storage facilities, was 18.13 million barrels a day in January for the 12 reporting countries. It was the first time the cartel released monthly production figures. Non-OPEC nations sending representatives to Tuesday's meeting were <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were expected to send observers. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 Just as Texans are hearing reports of an economic revival and new plans for reviving savings and loans, they're faced with yet another industry crisis: insolvencies in dozens of the state's insurance companies and the collapse of one of its largest. The $ 54 million failure of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had an estimated 100,000 policyholders, triggered a state inquiry into the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> and the industry itself. With 42 Texas-based insurance companies and 98 that do business in the state being liquidated, fears are growing that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> insurers are following the same road as S & amp; Ls. `` The potential is there,'' said State Rep. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman of budget and oversight. `` I do n't think we have gotten to the bottom of the pit -LRB- of insolvent insurance companies -RRB- and the closer we get to the bottom, the more horror stories I hear.'' A state auditor's report issued last week estimated the liabilities of insurance companies in receivership exceeded their assets by an estimated $ 200 million to $ 300 million as of Aug. 31. State officials say the factors that bedevil the insurance industry are the same as those that endangered the thrifts: lax and inept regulators, depressed real estate and oil markets and freespending company officials. In 1987, Texans paid an estimated $ 26 billion for insurance premiums, the audit said. The audit urged the insurance board to make identifying financially troubled insurance companies its highest priority. Regulators came under sharp criticism for their handling of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, whose president, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, is believed to be in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The insurance board staff knew about <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s problems as early as 1986 but did not move to place the Dallas-based casualty and property insurer in receivership until Oct. 24, 1988. A legislative report showed it took an average of more than one year from the time examiners knew a company was in deep financial trouble and the time it was placed into conservatorship. In December, when Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Doyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> resigned under pressure, he described the agency as under siege, trying to keep up with the insurance industry after years of being understaffed and underfunded while the sour economy brought on record insolvencies. During 1987 the agency was reorganized and its staff expanded from about 850 employees to 1,300. Board members said the reorganization contributed to the problems. But state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Montford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Lubbock </LOCATION>, blamed `` inept'' management. `` They're running at a pace that would have worked in the 1930s,'' he said. <PERSON> Montford </PERSON>, who chairs the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that conducted hearings on <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s failure, has sponsored 11 bills aimed at restructuring the insurance board. Also being drafted is a measure that would set up an oversight panel. Regulatory and criminal investigations are under way to determine what led to <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s insolvency, the costliest in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. The company's primary business was automobile insurance for high-risk drivers. Insurance board liquidator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Odiorne </PERSON> has filed a lawsuit against <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and his sons, alleging that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> `` and perhaps others'' diverted premium money to affiliated companies. Also named in the suit are <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Premium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. As in the savings and loans crisis, consumers could end up footing part of the bill to pay claims, which are expected to total $ 40 Initially, claims will be paid through the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> and Casualty Guaranty Fund, supported by healthy insurance companies but subsidized indirectly by the state. Tax credits the state gives to insurance companies that contribute to the guaranty fund translate into lost state treasury revenue, leaving taxpayers to make up the deficit. The new insurance commissioner, A.W. `` Woody'' <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON>, said he expects more failures, but none of the magnitude of <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We've made a lot of changes on the board,'' he said. `` I'm very optimistic that we've turned it around.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> may have swiped more than $ 20 million from the insurance company he led before it became one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest industry failures. Or he may be the most prominent insurance industry figure to fall victim to the havoc wreaked on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy by the oil and gas industry collapse. Or both. State and federal investigators trying to understand the failure of <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, may have to wait for his explanations _ first they have to find him. The tycoon, they say, has ignored subpoenas and may have fled the country. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> rose and fell in grand <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> style: buying rounds for patrons of his giant honky-tonk, sailing a multimillion-dollar yacht and flying several private planes before being caught in the economic pinch. By the time <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> was taken over by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> in October 1988, the property-casualty insurer was more than $ 50 million in the red. The size of the failure prompted a crisis of confidence in the state's insurance regulators, who have been accused by some lawmakers of failing to act quickly to help the company's estimated 100,000 customers. `` Mr. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is allegedly an example of what can happen when you have this lethargic attitude by a regulatory agency,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Montford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Montford </PERSON> serves on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has subpoenaed <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to appear at a hearing. <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said that based on reliable sources, she believes <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is accused of concealing fraud and funneling premiums from <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, his Dallas-based holding company that owned the insurance operation, according to a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>'s state-appointed receiver, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Odiorne </PERSON>. The state has seized some of <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s property, including two sterling silver decorative saddles valued at $ 100,000 apiece. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> owned a home in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and a ranch in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION>. His fortune was spread among more than 60 small companies and real estate properties. Until he transferred his control last year, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was part owner of the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, honky-tonk with saddles for barstools, silver dollars embedded in the bar and an 11,000-square-foot dance floor. He and two others bought the saloon in 1979. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> became well-known in the small tourist town during his visits several times a year. Stopping at the Million Dollar, he often would buy a round for the house and occasionally fly friends to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` Mostly he just partied,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>, who managed the Million Dollar for eight years. `` He was a nice guy. We seemed to get along real fine.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> could not be reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Calls to family members were unanswered. Calls to <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were referred to the liquidation office of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has said he tried to save the company at the expense of his luxurious lifestyle. `` I never kept money from the company,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> last fall, adding that he expected to be accused of taking about $ 28 million from <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He said he offered to contribute $ 3 million to the company to help recapitalize it, but the state turned him down. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> was crippled by the loss of a reinsurance contract with Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Republic began providing reinsurance in 1984 for <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> under a seven-year contract that anticipated $ 15 million worth of business transferred to the reinsurer each year. In 1985 National County transferred about $ 120 million in premiums to Republic _ eight times the anticipated amount _ and <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> suspended the contract, a spokesman for the reinsurer said. Republic's decision was upheld in court-ordered arbitration, which <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said rendered <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> unable to maintain its insurance portfolio, primarily automobile coverage to high-risk drivers. Republic, which had honored previous reinsurance contracts with <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, refused to enter another. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> began cutting back. National County took in more than $ 200 million in premiums at its peak, but was down to $ 50 million by the time state regulators took over last fall. As the insurance company's troubles grew, so did those in <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s other enterprises, particularly real estate investments for which he'd guaranteed payments before the energy collapse devastated the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy. `` I would think that he did what almost every businessman in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on a big roll did when the tap went dry,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricco </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` He'd just go to other taps that are available.'' <PERSON> Ricco </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> talked only a handful of times in the past five years, but they've known each other for 25 years. `` This lack of integrity I've heard about goes against the grain,'' <PERSON> Ricco </PERSON> said. `` I saw him honor agreements with everyone for years, including me, even to the detriment of himself.'' The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Inspector's office in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is leading a criminal investigation of <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s failure to determine if fraud was involved, inspector <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is also embroiled in several lawsuits stemming from unpaid real estate loans and other soured investments.

<HEAD>Consolidated Gold Fields to Fight Sweetened Minorco Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> has rejected as inadequate a sweetened $ 5.7 billion hostile takeover offer by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The board intends to resist the bid strongly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, who advised shareholders Monday to take no action in response to the offer, the largest bid ever for a British company. `` This renewed bid, which is of questionable value, bears no relation to the underlying worth of the company and is clearly not meant to be taken seriously by shareholders,'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said. Under British takeover rules, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, the investment arm of the South African Oppenheimer family's mining empire, needed to renew its bid by Thursday or risk having to wait till next fall to bid again. By announcing its offer now, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> gets nearly three months to proceed with its takeover attempt. The renewed bid follows approval Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted an informal inquiry into whether the proposed acquisition of the gold mining group would result in a monopoly of platinum markets. It also follows clearance by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s original bid automatically lapsed when the matter was referred to the commission in October. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> faces at least one more major legal hurdle. The offer is conditional on <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> winning its appeal against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court injunction which blocked it from acquiring more than 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' shares. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer would top <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.6 billion-pound, or $ 4.6 billion, purchase of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> confectioner <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> last year. The latest bid is worth 14 pounds, or $ 24.78, a share in cash and stock, for a total of 3.2 billion pounds, or $ 5.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s previous offer was 13.06 pounds, or $ 23.12, a share in cash and stock, for a total of 2.9 billion pounds, or $ 5.1 billion Consolidated Gold Fields' shares rose 8 pence to 14.43 pounds on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, suggesting that investors believed <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> eventually might make an even sweeter bid. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s shares rose 10 pence to 766 pence. Most analysts were surprised by the latest bid, having expected <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> to offer between 15 pounds and 16 pounds a share. By putting forward a bid on the low side, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> might be buying time while it overcomes obstacles to the takeover, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer `` is n't the end of the game,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreckley </PERSON>, a mining analyst at <ORGANIZATION> CL-Alexanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laing </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cruickshank </PERSON>. `` There might be another pound -LRB- per share -RRB- in it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> also might be hoping to force Consolidated Gold Fields to disclose the price at which it values itself. This is a `` sighting shot,'' Consolidated Gold Fields' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said. `` They do n't know what to pay and they want to get our defenses open.'' Based in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> is 60 percent-owned by the Oppenheimers' <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gold mining giant and the diamond mining group <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. It already owns 29.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' shares. Part of Consolidated Gold Fields defense in the past five months has been to raise objections to <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s South African connections. Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwardes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said, `` We have now cleared all the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> and European regulatory hurdles put in <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s way by the Gold Fields board.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> believes that the owners of Gold Fields should now be given the opportunity to consider the new offer on its merits and to determine the issues which affect them as shareholders,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> it would sell all <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' platinum interests should a takeover succeed. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> also has said it intends to sell other minority stakes held by Consolidated Gold Fields, including a 49-percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 48 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Renison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldfields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and 38 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. This would leave <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' ARC construction materials businesses in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and with <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 The stock market was mixed in early dealings today as trading resumed after a three-day holiday weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 38.75 points last week, was up another 1.43 at 2,326.25 after 30 minutes of trading.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Rail Workers Case from Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether a federal law primarily designed to compensate injured longshoremen also applies to railroad employees who work at dockside coal-loading facilities. The court, in cases involving three injured workers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said it will hear arguments by railroads seeking to protect themselves from potentially costly lawsuits. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act does not cover the railroad employees. Instead, the state court allowed three injured rail workers to seek potentially greater compensation under the Federal Employers' Liability Act The railroads said the compensation provided by the longshoremen's act should be the exclusive remedy for the three rail employees. The workers are <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwalb </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlone </PERSON>, who did clean-up jobs for the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a machinist for the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. All three worked at coal-loading terminals in the <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, area Ms. <PERSON> Schwalb </PERSON> suffered a serious head injury Jan. 11, 1983, when she fell from a catwalk while going to a nearby area to pick up spilled coal. <PERSON> McGlone </PERSON>'s arm was nearly severed as he was picking up coal from beneath a moving conveyor belt Feb. 1, 1983. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> suffered a hand injury while repairing loading equipment Feb. 11, 1985. The three sued the railroad company that employed them under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Lower courts in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> threw out their lawsuits on grounds that the workers were doing jobs essential to the loading of coal at the terminals, and thus were eligible for compensation only under the longshoremen's act. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the suits, deciding the rail employees' jobs were not covered by the longshoremen's act. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers supported the railroads' ensuing appeals to the nation's highest court. They said the three workers could get `` potentially lucrative, albeit uncertain, relief'' under the employers' liability law. But government lawyers said in other cases restricting the scope of the longshoremen's act could mean workers in similar jobs would be forced to sue under state laws that provide less compensation for the injured. `` That result would be plainly inconsistent with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent'' in 1972, when it amended the longshoremen's law to expand its coverage, the government lawyers said The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION> also urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overrule the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> court. The association said its members employ some 300,000 workers who, if injured, could sue them for compensation if the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> court ruling were applied nationwide. The cases are <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Schwalb </PERSON>, 87-1979, and <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> and Western vs. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, 88-127.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a largely technical reversal of Friday's strong rally in the soybean market. Precipitation in some key growing areas during the 3-day weekend also weighed on prices, analysts said. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, a major South American soybean producer, had its heaviest showers in several weeks while snow and rain improved the outlook for corn, soybean and winter-wheat production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the main factor in the decline appeared to be a bearish backlash after Friday's runup, which was not supported by significant changes in supplies or demand. `` When that happens, you often have some sort of reaction the following day as equilibrium returns,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Broker's Challenge Of SEC's Anti-Fraud Authority</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a prominent stock broker's challenge to the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to crack down on fraud. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> and the brokerage firm he founded, <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, say unfairly restrict their business activities. The case stems from a civil <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement action in 1980 against <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> and his firm. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> began the business in <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and moved its headquarters to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. It became one of the nation's leading underwriters of penny stocks, or low-priced securities. The commission accused <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> and the firm of deceiving investors in underwriting a $ 25 million sale of stock in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leisure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The stock sale was intended to finance construction and operation of a casino hotel in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> ruled in 1982 the firm defrauded investors by withholding important information, including the real risks of the casino venture. The judge said the firm's sales force `` practiced a program of deliberately deceptive misinformation which -LRB- <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> orchestrated.'' <PERSON> Matsch </PERSON> issued an injunction permanently barring <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> and his firm from engaging in similar practices. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> went back to court in 1986 to have the injunction lifted. He said he and the firm are rehabilitated, noting that he had replaced his sales force since 1982 and had given millions of dollars to charity. He also said the injunction was having dire, unforeseen consequences on his business. He said about a dozen states have taken steps to limit or ban <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> from selling securities, and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has imposed sanctions based on the court order. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> challenged the constitutionality of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement powers in such cases. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> said it violates the separation of powers to permit the commission to enforce the laws because the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is only partly accountable to the president. Commission members are appointed by the president, with the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and may be removed from office by the president for inefficiency, neglect of duty or misconduct. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last August refused to lift the injunction against the stock brokerage or its founder. The appeals court rejected arguments that evidence of rehabilitation means the injunction no longer is needed to protect the public. The appeals court also ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s powers do not violate the Constitution. The case is <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-850.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today announced three minicomputers that are built around microprocessors from <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and use the industry-standard Unix operating system. The new computers are at the forefront of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts in the field of network computing, which <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, described as `` by far the highest growth opportunity in the industry.'' The computers are known as the U 6000-30, U 6000-70 and U 6000-80. The U 6000-50 was announced last year. Members of the line cost from $ 11,500 to $ 1 million and can serve up to 400 users at once. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Convergent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in a $ 332 million transaction that was announced in August and completed in December. He had been chairman and chief executive. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> has headquarters in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The computer announcement came following last week's statement that <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> planned to reduce its workforce of 93,000 by 3 percent, about 2,800 people this year through layoffs and retirements. The company also plans to cut back on swollen inventories. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>'s statement about job cuts was made in response to a question at a security analysts' meeting on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said there was no formal announcement because the cutbacks were in line with previous steps. Since <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1986 through <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.8 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, it has pared 18,000 people from its payroll by selling off operations and cut 12,000 more through early retirements and layoffs, leaving it with 89,500 employees. Last year's acquisition of Convergent added 3,500 to the rolls. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> acknowledged last week that 1988 had been a tougher year than anticipated and he expected a weakness in sales to continue in the first half of 1989. Sales in 1988 increased just 2 percent from 1987, to $ 9.9 billion. Although <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' profits rose about 18 percent in 1988, most of the increase was attributable to lower tax rates, not bigger profit margins. The company's operating profits slumped nearly one-quarter on the final quarter of 1988.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> today asked labor leaders for their help and guidance but said it was too early to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s request for intervention in an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> labor dispute. `` I want a continued dialogue with the individuals in that room and certainly I want to have my door open and to be in touch with them regularly,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Council. In her statement to the council, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that `` to succeed in this mission, let me say once again that I will need your help, your guidance. We may not always agree on the best way to resolve the issues before us. But I assure you today that my door will always be open.'' Some of those disagreements were immediately apparent, however. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the administration remains committed to a sub-minimum youth training wage as part of any attempt to increase the minimum wage. Labor leaders want the minimum wage raised but vehemently oppose the training wage. And Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes mandatory child care and parental leave policies, both items on labor's congressional agenda. The Executive Council on Monday opened its annual meeting by asking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint a presidential emergency board to mediate the dispute between Eastern machinists and management. Such a move would delay a strike planned for March 4 by 60 days. But Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said it was premature to say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would appoint a board, saying he was awaiting a report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and legal advice from the Labor and Transportation departments. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> promised full support for the Eastern machinists in the event of a strike. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> will mobilize its resources to assist the employees at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to the fullest possible support in the event the machinists are forced to strike,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. The call for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the 16-month dispute before a March 4 strike deadline dominated the first day of the council's annual meeting The federation's 35-member governing body also issued several statements on its domestic policy agenda, including calls for an increased minimum wage and legislation expanding the availability of child care and parental leave. The Eastern dispute could provide the first sign of the relationship the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will have with labor. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Monday that the `` atmosphere'' of labor's relations with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have improved since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office, but added that that could change if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejects the machinists' request for a presidential emergency board to mediate the dispute. Asked what his reaction would be if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to name an emergency board, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, said, `` I think he would be sending a signal that he sides with one of the most irresponsible and avaricious employers in the country.'' If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did name such a panel, it would automatically delay by 60 days the strike deadline. If no agreement was reached in that period, the board would recommend a settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to force both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the union to abide by it. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> called on other unions to honor picket lines if the machinists strike, but acknowledged that previous walkouts against airlines have failed because union workers, particularly pilots, have ignored pickets. However, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and other union leaders spoke optimistically of the prospect of a unified union effort in the event of a strike, saying unions that might otherwise have been reluctant to support the machinists likely would do so because of the anti-union record of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> district lodge of the machinists' union, said his plans for a strike included picketing and boycotting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and any other carriers that have service agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Those pickets also would include any carriers of cargo and baggage either destined for or already carried by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, including railroads, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. He said there was no chance of a settlement before the March 4 deadline. Eastern has demanded that the machinists accept wage cuts of 20 percent to nearly 50 percent as well was reductions in company-paid pension benefits. Eastern officials have said the airline would hire replacements and operate during any strike. Support from pilots would be vital to labor's goal of preventing that. Ironically, many of the union leaders here for the meeting traveled on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which offered the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> a group discount.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> today said inflationary pressures are unacceptable and that the central bank would continue fighting higher prices by driving up interest rates. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks could spell bad news for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which is counting on robust economic growth to reduce the federal budget deficit without the need to increase taxes. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> released an economic forecast prepared by the central bank which showed growth significantly lower than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's estimate. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments were made in testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as part of the requirmeent that the central bank reveal its economic assumptions and monetary policy targets twice a year. The central bank has been pushing interest rates higher in an effort to restrain domestic demand since March of last year, an effort which has sent a variety of short-term interest rates climbing by about 3 percentage points. In his testimony, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> discussed this effort and said the central bank `` remains more inclined to act in the direction of restraint'' on the supply of credit. For the past two years, consumer prices have increased 4.4 percent annually, a rate of increase which <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said was worrisome. `` The wage and price process may have developed some momentum,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, citing reports showing that wage increases were rising at a faster clip because of the tight labor markets. `` Let met stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce inflation in coming years,'' he said. `` This restraint will involve containing pressures on our productive resources and, thus, some slowing in the underlying rate of growth'' of the overall economy. Since taking office, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has on several occasions said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s worries about inflation were misplaced, saying he saw no need to push interest rates higher. However, the central bank has so far ignored those comments, launching its latest credit-tightening effort just last week following a report on prices at the wholesale level which showed an unexpectedly sharp 1 percent increase in January. In his report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was predicting the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, would expand by between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 1989. The administration, however, is basing its budget on a forecast which expects growth to be a more robust 3.5 percent this year. To support its move to restrain inflationary pressures, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the central bank policy-makers reaffirmed a decision made last summer to lower money growth targets for 1989. For M-2, the measure of the money supply which includes currency in circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent, down a full percentage point from the 1988 growth target. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he understood that moves toward tightening the availability of money and driving up interest rates could have an adverse impact on the savings and loan crisis, the Third World debt situation and the debt problems of some American businesses. But he said that `` backing away from policy adjustments needed to contain inflation'' would not solve the various problems and would put the overall economy in more trouble. Most private economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has no choice but to keep tightening credit in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures, even at the risk of another downturn. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has acted responsibly over the past year in gradually pushing interest rates higher in response to indications that excessive economic growth and tight labor markets were threatening to set off another inflationary spiral. `` If you postpone the day of reckoning, it will still come and it will be a lot harsher,'' he said. `` If inflation rises significantly above levels where it is now, then interest rates would have to go much higher and the negative effects would be that much greater.'' That is what occurred in the last economic downturn in 1981-82 when then-Federal Reserve Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> pushed the prime rate up to a high of 21.5 percent in a battle to control the worst bout of inflation in this country since the Civil War. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> won the struggle but not without plunging the country into the 1981-82 recession, the worst downturn since the Great Depression. c

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest bank, reported Tuesday that its profit more than doubled in 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began a cash tender offer today for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock after topping a hostile bid for the Houston-based natural gas company by much larger rival, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Under the $ 3.2 billion deal, <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> plans to buy up to 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 60.8 million outstanding shares at $ 53 each, said <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Shares not purchased under the cash offer would be exchanged for <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock at the same $ 53 a share, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The agreement, subject to approval by federal regulators, was accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> board Monday afternoon, just hours after the $ 3.2 billion offer was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors The combination of the two Houston-based natural gas companies would create a 27,000-mile pipeline system, the nation's second-largest in total miles behind <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterloh </PERSON> said his company would study the <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> offer before deciding whether to continue its $ 2.6 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are going to consider our options, including possibly raising our offer, dropping our bid or other courses of action open to us,'' <PERSON> Osterloh </PERSON> said, adding that the company may have more to say on the development later today. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s stock soared $ 4 a share to $ 52.50 in early <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading today. `` In addition to the prospect of a significantly higher dividend, it will enable <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stockholders to participate in the future of a combined operation that will be enhanced by the synergy and efficiencies of the merger,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. The Panhandle Eastern bid came five weeks after Coastal offered $ 2.6 billion, or $ 42 a share. That offer was rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials who believed the company could fetch a higher price. `` We expect the combination of the two companies to result in significant operating synergies and appreciably enhanced operating income of the combined companies starting in 1990,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsucker </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer for <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has access to large mid-continent supplies of natural gas in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and also operates a large liquefied natural gas facility in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The company also has connections to Canadian gas through the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, while <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has access to the rapidly growing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> natural gas market. `` The combined systems will provide access to almost all the major gas processing markets in the nation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday they had talked to several interested companies since Coastal's surprise takeover bid was announced Jan. 16, but would not disclose the number or the seriousness of other inquiries. However, <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bid, which included provisions for a share exchange, was by far the superior offer. `` The purchase price is approximately $ 650 million higher than the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer, which our directors determined as inadequate and advised our stockholders to reject,'' he said. Also on Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> dissolved an injunction designed to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from deploying anti-takeover measures in other courts. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Coastal misrepresented facts when it said at the time of a preliminary hearing on its requested injunction that it was not involved in litigation elsewhere. Coastal issued a brief statement Monday which said the dissolution of the injunction `` should not have any impact on <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s court case because the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> had stayed the injunction back on Jan. 29, 1989.'' Wichlep, of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' action means `` we are free to take any legal matters that may arise subsequently to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court or any other court.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its net earnings rose 8 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 1989 when compared to the first quarter of the previous year. Per-share earnings were up 17 percent, the electronics giant said. Net earnings rose to $ 193 million, or 83 cents a share, from $ 179 million, or 71 cents per share, in the first quarter of last year. Revenue rose 21 percent to $ 2.66 billion from $ 2.19 billion. Earnings from operations grew by 20 percent, but reductions in interest income softened their impact in net results. The company said its cash balance dropped from the year-ago quarter due to the high level of stock repurchases during 1988. Orders climbed to $ 3.0 billion from $ 2.4 billion a year ago, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> orders rising 17 percent and international orders up 29 percent. `` We are pleased with the substantial increase in orders throughout the quarter, and with the growth from the first quarter of fiscal 1988, which was also an especially strong period for us,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. Young, the company's president and chief executive, said in a statement. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> order growth rate also was good news.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, has 87,000 employees and 1988 revenue of $ 9.8 billion.

Dealers said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> did not say anything new or surprising in his testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s banking committee but many regarded his comments as less aggressively bullish than had been expected. `` -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- monetary policy remains unchanged,'' said a dealer in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It looks like further interest rate increases are out of the question for the time being.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> called for financial restraints to prevent further rises in inflation but said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy `` appears to be on track'' and that he expected the dollar to remain stable for some months. The dollar had gained in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and early European dealings on expectations that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> would strongly emphasize the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to fighting inflation, dealers said `` Ultimately, the market actually wants to see higher -LRB- interest -RRB- rates rather than just forecast that they will materialize,'' said a senior dealer in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 1.40 Japanese yen to a closing 127.15 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it eased to 126.75 yen.

 The stock market turned mixed this afternoon, with a key blue-chip index rising while broader market measures fell. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 38.75 points last week, was up 3.57 at 2,328.39 with one hour left in the session.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after a late surge of buying by commercial interests erased losses that prevailed for most of the session. The buying may have reflected a desire of grain handlers and processors to lock in their supply costs at current levels and avoid a sudden runup in prices like the one that ended Friday's session. But analysts also said much of the day's activity was motivated by technical traders' interpretations of recent chart patterns. The session opened on a low note after the 3-day weekend, with much of the selling attributed to improved growing conditions for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop and weekend precipitation in some key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop regions.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Tougher Reviews Of Pension Denials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday told federal judges to toughen their reviews of decisions by pension and welfare plans that deny benefits to workers. Federal judges must evaluate the cases just as if the pension and welfare plan officials had not yet made any decision, the justices said in a unanimous ruling in a case involving <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The justices said federal courts have been employing a less stringent standard of review _ generally not disturbing decisions by plan officials unless they are found to be `` arbitrary or capricious.'' The dispute stemmed from Firestone's sale of its plastics division in 1980 to <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Last year <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 2.6 billion to acquire In other cases involving business, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> clarified how federal copyright and patent laws apply to states, rejected an appeal by mining companies in a hazardous-waste case, rejected a challenge to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s crackdown on fraud, and limited the ability of people to seek additional damages after winning a lawsuit. _ The court refused to let states and state agencies be sued for alleged violations of federal copyright law It turned away a <LOCATION> Radford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, case that highlighted a conflict between the Constitution's 11th Amendment shielding states from federal lawsuits and copyright law requiring all suits be filed in federal court. Photographer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had sued <ORGANIZATION> Radford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a state-run school, and some school officials over the unauthorized use in 1982 of copyright photographs. _ The court unanimously ruled that states may not offer the equivalent of patent protection for utilitarian and design ideas left unprotected by federal law The justices killed a lawsuit in which a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> boat manufacturer charged that its design for a fiberglass recreational boat was duplicated illegally by a competitor. The court said only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and not individual states, can decide at some future date to protect certain industrial design ideas. _ The justices rejected an appeal by mining companies seeking an exemption from federal environmental rules for certain hazardous wastes The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> must regulate the wastes. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July that a 1980 federal law exempting some `` high volume, low hazard'' mining wastes from environmental rules does not apply to certain types of waste produced from smelting. _ The high court rejected a prominent stockbroker's challenge to the market-policing power of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> The court, without comment, left intact rulings contested by <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> and the brokerage firm he founded, <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The case stems from a civil <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement action in 1980 against <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON> and his firm. _ The justices, in a case involving alleged fraud in a 20-year-old business merger, limited the ability of people to seek additional damages after winning a lawsuit The 9-0 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> restricts the ability of purported fraud victims to sue a leading accounting firm, <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION>, which they accused of preparing inflated financial statements.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Central Bank Will Pursue Fight Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Tuesday the central bank will keep up its inflation-fighting efforts by pushing interest rates higher to combat what he termed a troubling acceleration in price pressures. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in his semiannual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on monetary policy, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> expects `` to support continued economic expansion while putting in place conditions for a gradual easing in the rate of inflation over time.'' He added, however: `` Let me stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an increase, is not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce inflation in coming years.'' Since last March, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been nudging up interest rates in an attempt to slow economic growth and avoid a flare-up of inflation. Those efforts intensified last week after a report on prices at the wholesale level showed a 1 percent increase during the month of January, equivalent to a compounded annual inflation rate of 12.7 percent. Prices at the consumer level in 1988 increased by 4.4 percent, the same pace as during the previous year and a rate that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> considers worrisome. `` With the economy running close to its potential, the risks seem to be on the side of a further strengthening of prices pressures,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. `` In these circumstances, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> remains more inclined to act in the direction of restraint than toward stimulus.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s always-challenging task of charting monetary policy has been made more difficult by the unprecedented combination of an aging economic recovery, financial failures in the savings and loan industry, rising levels of corporate debt and the large trade and budget deficits. `` We have never confronted a situation that is exactly comparable to what we are in at this particular stage,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the problems are so large `` that it very significantly skews policy toward reducing the budget deficit and making certain that inflation does not accelerate.'' `` It's clear to me that much of the problems that we are confronted with could be assisted in an extremely positive way by a very expeditious and significant cut in the deficit,'' he said. `` I am not one of those who believes that the process of cutting the deficit can be overdone.'' Congressional leaders met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to discuss budget and deficit-reduction plans, but legislators still were hoping the administration would provide more details on where it believes spending can be reduced. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he remained optimistic that an agreement could be reached. `` We can not take the risk of not resolving it,'' he said. `` The degree of risk of allowing this whole process to fester is unacceptable.'' Analysts said that while <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the fight against inflation, financial markets had hoped for something even stronger. `` It's a matter of tone, but the markets would have preferred a little more anti-inflation vigor, `` said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Added economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Langston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` In view of the new and disturbing evidence on inflation, ... the markets were expecting some even tougher talk from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman.'' `` There's a general perception that maybe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is falling a bit behind the inflation curve,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent weeks has voiced fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would overreact to concerns about inflation, saying he saw no need for the central bank to push interest rates higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up short-term interest rates by a behind-the-scenes process that siphons off available bank reserves. This tightening of the money supply drives up the cost of that money _ interest rates. But while the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> nevertheless has continued to push up interest rates, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> in his testimony played down his differences with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, particularly on assumptions for future economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> expects the economy, as measured by the gross national product, to expand 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 1989. The administration, meanwhile, forecasts growth of 3.5 percent this year and is counting on short-term interest rates to gradually decline. The banking committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., called the administration's rosy outlook `` startling'' and questioned whether it was realistic, but <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forecast was `` reasonable'' considering the administration's deficit-reduction and budget <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also refused to criticize the administration's proposal to reduce the capital gains tax as a way to stimulate investment and generate more revenue. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue projections are `` credible'' and that he would like to see the capital gains tax rate lowered so long as the reduction is not accompanied by tax increases elsewhere.

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the tough-as-nails chairman of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has a master's degree in business administration from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. So does <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who flies planes for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the besieged carrier owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The two are on opposite sides of a bitter, escalating conflict that could result in a March 4 strike by the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which the Eastern pilots and flight attendants have pledged to honor. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a member of the master executive council of the pilots union at Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, is spreading the union gospel about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to Wall Street analysts, creditors of the strapped airline and the public. The campaign is aimed at forcing <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to sign what <PERSON> George </PERSON> called acceptable contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, pilots and flight attendants at Eastern. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 46, does n't pull punches. He's going after his cost-cutting boss with nearly the same fervor he showed flying combat support missions as an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> captain in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is `` looking at the abyss. The evil empire is tottering,'' he said in a recent interview in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We understand the risk -LRB- of striking -RRB-. The worst thing that can happen to us is that we lose our jobs.'' That risk appears real. Many financial analysts and other observers believe a strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could jeopardize the airline's survival. Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $ 335.4 million in 1988, nearly double its $ 181.7 million loss the year before. Revenue dropped to $ 3.8 billion from $ 4.4 billion in 1987. The airline's latest contract offer _ rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> _ calls for $ 150 million in wage cuts. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said no Eastern officials wished to comment on <PERSON> George </PERSON> or his activities. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Class of ` 74, calls <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, Class of ` 63, `` a financial genius but a business moron.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> has organized a presentation for Wall Street analysts and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday _ the same day intensified talks involving <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management, the Machinists and federal mediators are set to start in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Among other things, <PERSON> George </PERSON> said, the pilots and their financial consultants plan to warn the airline's creditors of the risk to them if Eastern is hit by a strike. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who is a manager of the Eastern pilots' pension fund, masterminded a session with analysts last September. He also was a prime organizer of a demonstration against <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> later that month at the 25th reunion of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> class in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was among the speakers addressing the rally. How did an Eagle Scout and church altar boy from rural <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> arrive at center stage in the high-stakes conflict? `` I'm a pilot and I'm basically fighting for the profession,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who manages to look like a boxer, <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> banker and farm boy. `` This profession is in a death struggle with Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>.'' Sitting in the paneled mahogany caverns of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, he seems more culturally akin to the corporate dealmakers he assails than the mechanics and baggage handlers he supports. <PERSON> George </PERSON> grew up on a farm in <LOCATION> Sycamore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, studied mathematics and economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, and later flew support missions in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, evacuating casualties. After his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> service from 1967 to 1971, <PERSON> George </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> while starting to fly for Eastern, getting his MBA in 1974. Wall Street was the next move, but he did n't stay there long. `` I had a brief but mediocre career,'' he said, referring to his stint at <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't particularly like being tied to a desk.'' But <PERSON> George </PERSON> does like flying. He left the desks of Wall Street to return to the cockpits of Eastern in 1974 and has been flying for the carrier ever since. He's clocked around 10,000 hours of flight time, he reckons, on domestic routes and in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. His jabs at Lorenzo are n't all deadly serious. At the pilots' meeting with financial analysts last September, <PERSON> George </PERSON> caught the attention of the normally blase analysts and news reporters by bouncing a striped beach ball during his opening remarks `` Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> agreed to cater the meal today,'' he told the participants solemnly, as waiters proceeded to serve peanuts from silver trays.

<HEAD>Most People Believe Takeover Process Is Corrupt, Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of people interviewed in a national survey believe the corporate takeover process in this country is corrupt and should be regulated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the survey released Tuesday, 84 percent of the respondents said they believed mergers and acquisitions take place in a corrupt environment, and two-thirds said the government should place more restrictions on leveraged buyouts. In a leveraged buyout, investors buy a company with largely borrowed funds, and then pay off the loans with the company's cash flow or by selling its assets. The survey, conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Lexis, a computerized legal data base operated by the information firm <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, polled 808 people between Jan. 28 and 30. During that time, two congressional committees were holding hearings into possibly restricting LBOs. Public awareness of and concern about LBOs have increased in recent months as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s record $ 24.53 buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the survey, which has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, 32 percent of the respondents endorsed restructuring tax laws to make it more difficult for LBOs to be accomplished, a step that has received support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Twenty-four percent of the respondents said consumers are hurt the most by takeovers. Fifty-four percent said employees are hurt the most, but one-third also said the gretest benefit of takeover activity was the creation of new jobs. More than one-fifth of the respondents said they or a member of their immediate family had worked for a company that was involved in a takeover in the last three years. Of that group, almost 50 percent reported negative consequences of the takeover, including the loss of a job.

 The stock market turned in a narrowly mixed performance today, with a key blue-chip index rising while the broader market fell. Traders cited worries that interest rates may be headed higher for the day's lackluster performance. The stock market had finished strongly last week, as three consecutive gains lifted the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average by more than 43 points. Traders closely monitored <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony today before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> committee. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said inflationary pressures are unacceptable and that the central bank would continue fighting higher prices by driving up interest rates. Traders said the market viewed the comments largely as restatements of positions <PERSON> Greenpsan </PERSON> had previously expressed, but was also hesitant to push ahead in advance of Wednesday's scheduled report on consumer prices in January. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets reopened today after being closed Monday in observance of the President's Day holiday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the only domestic television maker, reported the first annual profit in four years Tuesday, attributing the performance to booming computer sales and modest growth in its consumer electronics division. Some industry analysts said the $ 11.7 million in 1988 net income could mark a turning point in the company's fortunes. But Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s management was continuing to explore all avenues _ including selling all or part of the consumer electronics business _ to keep the company profitable. `` We are mindful of our responsibilities to our shareholders to increase the value of their investment in <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We have not ruled anything out.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> reported net income for the fourth quarter of $ 20.4 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $ 4.7 million, or 18 cents a share for the last three months of 1987. Sales for the period totaled $ 841 million, a 23 percent increase from fourth-quarter 1987 sales of $ 686 million. The results included a one-time gain of $ 6.4 million, which represented a reduction in income taxes from operating losses that were carried forward from the previous year. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s full-year net income of $ 11.7 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $ 19.1 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 10 million in 1986 and $ 7.7 million in 1985. In 1984, its last profitable year, the company had net income of $ 63.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s sales for all of 1988 totaled $ 2.7 billion, up 14 percent from 1987 sales of $ 2.4 billion. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s highly regarded computer systems and components climbed 23 percent in 1988 to nearly $ 1.6 billion while revenues from the recovering consumer electronics division rose 2.7 percent to $ 1.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> had said in October that it expected to show a pretax profit in 1988. But several industry analysts said they were surprised the company did better than break even after taxes. `` I'm encouraged by the results,'' said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Menear </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They've got some difficulties ahead but this shows they are able to make money in consumer electronics.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the 1988 earnings signaled a `` major improvement'' in <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s TV and video-equipment business. He predicted further gains for that segment in 1989 as prices rise and more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers opt for the pricey large-screen and stereo TV sets that <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> produces with great efficiency. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Magid </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was less enthusiastic about <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s future. `` There is no reason to suppose this is a major turning point,'' he said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s TV business nosedived in the mid-1980s as a flood of low-priced South Korean-made televisions reached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, joining the low-priced Japanese models already on shelves. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> recently asked the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to monitor imports for illegal `` dumping'' of TV sets at unfairly low prices. Since 1985, the company has concentrated on increasing its manufacturing efficiency through employee reductions and plant consolidations. Those moves put the company in an ideal position to profit from the increased demand for U.S.-made products that has resulted from the dollar's plunge in value against foreign currencies. At the same time, Chinese demand for televisions has increased dramatically with the opening of that country to foreign trade, creating a worldwide shortage of picture tubes. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> has benefited from the tight-supply situation, which is not expected to ease this year, and the company announced last week it was hiring 600 people at its picture-tube plant in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Melrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to increase production. The company also is working on a high-definition television system that it hopes the government will select as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standard for the new technology. That would bring <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> lucrative patent royalties. Despite these positive signs, analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> still lags behind foreign producers in sales of portable television with screens measuring less than 19 inches diagonally, a market that constitutes a large chunk of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand.

 Several independent oil producing countries said Tuesday they would cut or freeze oil exports during the second quarter to help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> support world oil prices. The non-OPEC group, after a daylong meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, released a statement saying more information was forthcoming but did not disclose details of the agreement or say which countries would participate. `` Specific announcements with respect to the above decisions will be made by the respective authorities in the course of next week,'' the group said in a statement. Participating in the talks at the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> were <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the communique said. Also attending were observers from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, it said. Oil analysts said the agreement would help bolster oil prices in the short-term. But they added that such cuts would have little impact on the buoyant supply and weak demand in the oil market. There was little immediate reaction in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> oil market. After the communique was released, the spot price of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was $ 16.30 a barrel, up 10 cents from late Monday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell by about 15 cents following the announcement. Analysts said the lack of details about the agreement pressured the market. The agreement `` is fairly significant,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, an oil analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scrimgeour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it means the extension of the oil producers' cartel, even if the countries do n't want to commit themselves to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> at this stage. It also was significant that the independent producers were acting unilaterally, analysts said. They were doing so because the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> has managed to curb its production, they said. Last year, independent oil producers offered to cut their output by 5 percent, if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reciprocal cuts. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> refused. Some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members have expressed resentment that independent producers enjoy the benefits of the cartel's production limits without making a contribution. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 members are estimated to be producing about 19.5 million barrels a day, one million barrels above their agreed production limit but well below their fourth-quarter production. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has set a target price of $ 18 a barrel. `` The psychological impact -LRB- on the oil markets -RRB- will be quite strong,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. But, `` I think the total volume of the cuts makes little difference to the whole supply and demand question.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said, `` Basically, we see it as fairly positive for the oil price short-term. `` Basically, it will help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> through the seasonal demand downturn in the second quarter. We still see a dip in the oil price but not as dramatically as it would have been.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> predicted oil prices would fall to $ 14.50 to $ 15 a barrel in March and April. The analyst said he expects the independent producers to cut exports by between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day. `` A cut of 100,000 -LRB- cq -RRB- to 300,000 is n't going to have a dramatic effect on the supply and demand balance,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. The communique also said some participants `` will go back to their authorities for further consultations in order to determine their contribution.'' `` Further meetings of technical experts will be convened on a regular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the market situation as well as compliance with the agreement,'' the statement said. The group set May 16 for the next meetig to `` address the prospects of the second half of the year, a period viewed by the experts with caution.'' Individual delegates would not elaborate when they emerged from the meeting.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover Says Trader Lost $14 Million In Unauthorized
Dealings</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday a vice president in its government bond trading department lost $ 14 million for the bank last year through unauthorized, secret dealings in Canadian bonds. The bank refused to identify the individual but said the person `` has been relieved of his or her duties.'' The bank said the loss, discovered earlier this month in a routine review, caused it to reduce its reported profit for 1988 by 1.4 percent to $ 952 million, instead of $ 966 million as reported in a January news release. `` The employee is not only very experienced but clever and sophisticated,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON>, a bank spokesman. He said the person had been with Manufacturers Hanover about five years and in the business about 20 years. The vice president, without authorization, bought about $ 600 million worth of Canadian federal and provincial bonds over at least a year, mainly in the final weeks of 1988, <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said. To conceal the transactions, the person put them in the bank's investment account instead of its trading account, <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said Securities held in the investment account are carried on the books at what they cost. When the securities were moved to the trading account, where they belonged, they had to be booked at their lower market value, resulting in the $ 14 million loss, <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said the bank had been in contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said it has not yet been determined whether to lodge civil or criminal charges against the executive. The bank has reviewed its procedures for preventing unauthorized trading, <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said. But he added, `` A sophisticated enough person, for a particular period of time, if intent on doing something, can probably get away with it.'' `` Everybody on the floor was surprised'' when word of the unauthorized trading got out, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who is in charge of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond and municipal bond trading. In addition to the correction in full-year earnings, the bank cut its reported earnings for the fourth quarter by $ 14 million, to $ 210 million from $ 224 million. The earnings did not have to be formally restated because they had never been officially stated, only put out in a press release, <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said. Losses from unauthorized trading in recent years have prompted scrutiny of management controls at some Wall Street firms. The giant investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reorganized its mortgage securities unit after unauthorized trading in a risky form of security caused a $ 275 million pre-tax loss in April 1987.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge On Reports Of Zambian Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices posted their sharpest gains in three months Tuesday as reports of flood-related mining disruptions in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> refocused attention on the difficulties faced by many Third World copper producers. On other markets, gold futures rose sharply; cotton futures soared; livestock and meat futures rallied; grains and soybeans were mixed; and energy futures were mostly lower. Copper futures settled 2.9 cents to 8.3 cents higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.345 a pound, representing a one-day gain of nearly 6.6 percent in the contract's value. The concerns raised by flooding at a <ORGANIZATION> Zambia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> facility spread well beyond the implications for copper output from <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, the world's fourth-largest copper producer. The incident served to remind traders of the strain on copper producers in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as they strive to catch up with the demand created by the strong economies of the industrialized world. Copper production hurdles and labor difficulties have cropped up during the past year in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> while the major African coppper countries have struggled with transportation problems. Those factors helped push copper futures prices to the record high of $ 1.6475 reached on Dec. 8. But production concerns have faded in recent weeks as copper stockpiles increased. `` A market is very much a forum for changes in sentiment,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The flooding was important but it also focused people's attention on broad output problems throughout the Third World.'' The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported a 1,750-metric-ton decrease last week in its warehouse stocks of copper, to 85,025 metric tons. <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> said the market had been expecting an increase of more than 5,000 metric tons. Gold futures advanced strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was perceived as being too soft on inflation. Gold is often seen as an investment hedge against inflation. Gold settled $ 5.10 to $ 5.60 higher with April at $ 389.40 a troy ounce; silver settled 0.5 cent lower to 0.1 cent higher with March at $ 5.935 a troy ounce. Cotton futures rallied on reports that the Plains Cotton Cooperative in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had sold from 250,000 to 300,000 bales of cotton, an unusually large amount, to unknown destinations. Cotton settled .88 cent to 1.54 cents higher with March at 58.57 cents a pound. Feeder cattle led the livestock and meat futures markets higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to continued strong demand among meat packers for fattened cattle. Live cattle settled .28 cent to .83 cent higher with April at 77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent to 1.35 cents higher with March at 84.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent to 1 cent higher with April at 42.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with February at 39.32 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after a late surge of buying by commercial interests erased the losses that had held sway for most of the session. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 \ cents higher with March at $ 4.25 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 2.69 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 7 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.13 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with March at $ 7.46 -LCB- a Energy futures prices finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in nervous trading while traders kept one eye on a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting of oil ministers from non-OPEC countries. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent lower to .03 cent higher with March at $ 18.59 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .98 cent lower with March at 48.92 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to .94 cent lower with March at 48.35 cents a gallon.

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> common stock fell nearly 14 percent Tuesday, apparently because a Barron's magazine article said the stock could become worthless when the utility emerges from bankruptcy protection. The opening of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading in <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> common stock was delayed 31 minutes Tuesday morning because there were too many sell orders and not enough buyers. The stock then lost nearly 20 percent of its value by noon, falling from its Friday closing price of $ 5.50 to $ 4.50 a share. The stock made up a little ground in the afternoon, closing at $ 4.75. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a utility analyst with <ORGANIZATION> McCarthy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisanti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maffei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the article in the new issue of <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s apparently prompted the fall <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said company officials had no other explanation. Headlined `` Common Mistake: A Bankrupt Utility Generates More Speculative Heat Than Light,'' the article was written by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and general partner in <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, two <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> firms that invest primarily in companies under bankruptcy protection. Fry noted that <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock price has more than doubled in the 13 months since it became the first major investor-owned utility to seek bankruptcy protection since the Great Depression. Debt from its 36 percent share of the stalled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power project forced <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to seek bankruptcy refuge. `` In large measure, the rise in the shares reflects investors' faith that <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> _ and its common -LRB- stock -RRB- _ will revive when the company finally emerges from Chapter 11,'' Fry wrote But at least for common stockholders, `` that faith is n't likely to be rewarded,'' Fry wrote. `` Quite the contrary. Holders of the company's common -LRB- stockholders -RRB- could find themselves with totally worthless paper when <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> comes out of Chapter 11'' of the federal bankruptcy code. That is because <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s liabilities exceed the market value of its assets, Fry explained, and under bankruptcy law, bondholders and other senior claims must be paid in full before lesser claims may receive any compensation. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` has secured and unsecured obligations of nearly $ 2 billion. It also has nearly $ 500 million of liquidating value of preferred stock, which takes priority in a reorganization. Against the obligations, the company has a conventional utility plant with a book value of about $ 650 million, and its investment in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>,'' Fry wrote. He noted that it remains uncertain whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> ever will be allowed to operate commercially, and even if it does, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to recover what it has invested in the reactor. Even an acquisition offer by <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>, estimated to be worth $ 2 billion if <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operates, would leave nothing for preferred stockholders, much less common stockholders, Fry said. `` It's extremely speculative to think that common shareholders will get anything at all in a reorganization,'' Fry concluded. `` So, if you have an uncontrollable urge to speculate in <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>, its bonds appear to be a much more rational vehicle.''

 The Dow Jones industrial average posted a tiny gain Tuesday but broader market measures slumped in what some analysts said was a reflection of deepening worries about inflation and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 38.75 points last week, eked out a gain of 1.61 points to close at 2,326.43. But declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 611 up, 872 down and 505 unchanged. `` The market seems to have lost its momentum, its gusto, the urgency to buy coming off the lows of last November,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON>, a market strategist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. He said traders were becoming more concerned about inflation, a concern that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> acknowledged in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 141.95 million shares, down from 159.52 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 173.90 million shares. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets reopened Tuesday for the first time in three days after being closed on Monday in observance of the President's Day holiday. The stock market had finished strongly last week, propelling the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average up by more than 43 points in the last three sessions alone. Traders closely monitored <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s congressional testimony on Tuesday, and some came away disappointed that he was n't more forceful in repeating an earlier pledge that the central bank would continue fighting higher prices by driving up interest rates. <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> left open the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials `` may not be able to tighten as much as they'd like'' because of the financial failures in the savings and loan industry. `` People are really starting to get concerned here about inflation,'' <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON> said. Few traders appeared ready to buy stocks in advance of Wednesday's scheduled report on consumer prices in January. Earlier this month, the government reported a bigger-than-expected rise in producer prices in January. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market may simply have been due for a correction. `` It is more a lack of buyers than an abundance of sellers,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Sonat </ORGANIZATION> was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, rising ~ to 32 after a pair of 2 million share blocks were traded. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was second most active on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, jumping 3 ~ to 52 -RRB- On Monday, the company agreed to a $ 53-a-share takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>.

 Most oil futures prices ended lower in volatile trading Tuesday, reflecting uncertainty over the outcome of a non-OPEC producers conference. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed 3 cents higher at $ 18.59 after trading as high as $ 18.93 during the session. All other contract months fell. Refined product prices fell sharply. The March contract for heating oil dropped 0.98 cent to settle at 48.92 cents a gallon, after trading at a session high of 50.35 cents. Unleaded gasoline scheduled for March delivery fell 0.94 cent to a closing price of 48.35 cents a gallon. Other contract months also closed down. Crude prices opened higher with buyers caught up in last-day trading on the March contract, analysts said. Prices fluctuated throughout the session on various OPEC-related rumors, they said. Late in the day, a group of producers who do n't belong to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, released a statement saying some producers had agreed to either cut or freeze exports during the second quarter of 1989 to help stabilize world prices. However, the group said it would not disclose details of the agreement until next week, which created uncertainty and pressured prices, analysts said. `` It's disappointing because investors were expecting concrete numbers,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` As long as they do n't know it's difficult to say what the bottom line is ... so the market sold off.'' Analysts have predicted that any cutbacks by non-OPEC nations will be minimal and probably will not alter the current supply-demand balance. Since <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> reduced its production by 3 million barrels daily at the start of the year, prices have risen nearly $ 5 a barrel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it no longer will market its products through <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stores in the wake of a dispute with the huge retail chain. `` It has become apparent to us that continuing our relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> is not in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> or our customers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON>, vice president of sales and marketing for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> last year accounted for about 7 percent of the $ 2.1 billion in annual revenue for <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, a leading maker of desktop, laptop and portable personsal computers. At the same time, sales of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> products accounted for about 15 percent of the $ 872 million in net sales during fiscal 1988 for <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> had requested a business relationship in which the companies would have been `` strategic partners. <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said that would have required <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> to give <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> company preferential treatment, <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> has n't given it and <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> has elected not to support <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` Simply put, <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly requested special treatment that would give them an advantage over other authorized dealers. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> remains committed to the philosophy that authorized dealers should be treated fairly and equally,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> over time kept asking ask <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> for preferential treatment in terms of profit margins, certain support systems and other areas. Beach said he could not provide specifics. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement surprised <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that it was in compliance with <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s authorized dealer agreement and that <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s notification was unforeseen <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing and communications, said the retailer had asked <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> to reimburse it for some of the cost of giving technical support to buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> computers. She said <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> has such arrangements with other computer makers. Adding to tension between <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, told securities analysts two weeks ago that <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> would put the bulk of its technical support behind computers such as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Personal System-2 line that are built on Micro Channel Architecture. That was a rebuff to <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, which is working with other <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rivals on an alternative to Micro Channel called Extended Industry Standard Architecture. `` Micro Channel is the best solution for the future given what we know today,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said Tuesday. The agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in effect since 1983, will terminate effective April 21. `` I think on a short-term basis, <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> will sell their current inventory and that may have a short-term negative pricing effect,'' on <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, ana analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But Businessland officials say they are confident the addition of new vendors and continuing sales of other products will restore revenue. <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said the company anticipates <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> customers to move their business to other dealers. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> informed <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> of its decision Monday. <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said several <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> dealers have been de-authorized during the past six years. `` The action is specific to this single dealer, and, as such, does not indicate any change in <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s strategic commitment to its other dealers,'' <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said. For 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> had record sales of $ 2.1 billion, up from $ 1.2 billion in 1987. The company also had a record net income of $ 255 million for 1988, up from $ 136 million in 1987.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on Tuesday promised to work with labor and piqued the interest of union leaders by calling for a flexible pension system, but she also disagreed with them on several issues. The tone of the first meeting between the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Council and Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was amiable despite the differences, a stark contrast with the first such session of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, when then-Labor Secretary <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> and the union leaders clashed publicly over the president's economic plans. There was no such acrimony after the meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, although federation President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said it was inevitable that labor would disagree with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on some issues. `` I want continued dialogue with the individuals in that room and certanly I want to leave my door open and be in touch with them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after her private meeting with the 35-member council. While Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> represented the Republican administration at the meeting, new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s political committee. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he briefed the labor leaders on party efforts to gain 500 seats in state legislatures by 1990 and 100 more by 1992, an effort to increase the number of state legislatures, 28, in which Democrats control all chambers. `` Labor's got an extremely important role in the party,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` Labor has important political tentacles around the country, it can be very important in electing Democrats.'' At a meeting with reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> raised a proposal to allow workers who change jobs to carry pension funds with them. She said that the administration was studying the issue and that she asked the labor leaders for their input. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the federation welcomed her interest and would cooperate. An early disagreement likely will be on congressional proposals to raise the minimum wage. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would support that if the legislation also carried a sub-minimum training wage for youths; <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> opposes the lower wage. Other areas of apparent disagreement are child care and parental leave, with the administration favoring voluntary policies that might include tax credits. Labor backs Democrat-sponsored bills that mandate some programs. `` We never signed on for a honeymoon,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said when asked to assess labor's early relations with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` It's early on and we have yet to see what issues or areas we can cooperate on. I'm quite certain there will be some where we disagree.'' The meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> came on the second day of the annual weeklong meeting of the governing body of the 1.9 million-member federation.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began a $ 1.1 billion stock buyback Tuesday and said the plan may include $ 325 million in privately negotiated share purchases, a move some analysts said was aimed at the company's hostile suitor. The instant camera maker, which announced Jan. 30 that it would undertake the buyback, began a cash tender offer for 16 million shares at $ 50 a share. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said it would repurchase $ 325 million of its stock on the open market or `` in privately negotiated purchases.'' The offer of private negotiations was seen by some as an invitation to <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which holds a 6.7 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and is pursuing a $ 3.2 billion hostile takeover of the company. `` They're leaving the door wide open for greenmail,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't think of any other privately held block of stock other than <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s that would be negotiated individually.'' Greenmail is the practice of buying back shares held by a corporate raider at a premium compared with the market price, in order to thwart a potential or actual hostile bid. Critics say the practice favors raiders at the expense of other stockholders. But some Wall Street analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> seemed to be making an effort to placate its stockholders by offering a premium for some of their shares. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s buyback offer of $ 50 a share is $ 5 over <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION>'s last bid and $ 6.25 above Friday's closing price for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 37 -LCB- cents to close at $ 43.37 -LCB- a share. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, said the drop reflected anxiety about the possibility of greenmail. `` Polaroid's announcement is good for 30 percent of the stock and bad for 70 percent,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. `` It does provide shareholder value for some of the shares, but if they remove <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> by doing this, the remaining shares could decline in value.'' <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> called the buyback a further attempt at entrenchment by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s management. `` We believe that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s partial buyback is a far leass attractive alternative than <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 45 cash offer for all <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares,'' Shamrock President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, a television and radio concern owned by the <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> family, owns about 4.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and is waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the May 9 annual meeting, in addition to its hostile tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has been resisting Shamrock since the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company made a friendly but unsolicited offer of $ 40 a share last July. In September, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> launched a hostile offer of $ 42 per share. Last month, it boosted that offer to $ 45. Polaroid last July put 9.7 million shares into an employee stock ownership plan. In January, the company announced a recapitalization plan that included selling $ 300 million of preferred stock to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, a private investment group. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to block <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s buyback, the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> and the sale of stock to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. Polaroid is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said its stock repurchase offer expires March 20 and is subject to various conditions, including definitive financing, an absence of adverse decisions in lawsuits with <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, and changes in <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s hostile bid. If more than 16 million shares are tendered, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said it will buy shares back on a pro rata basis.

<HEAD>Troubled Toy Company Announces Plan To Sell To Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Worlds of <ORGANIZATION> Wonder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it reached a definitive agreement to sell the troubled toy company to a group of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investors for an undisclosed amount, subject to bankruptcy court approval. If the deal signed Monday is approved, Worlds of Wonder will emerge from its reorganization, the company said in a statement. The company began in a trailer in 1985 and saw sales climb to $ 300 million within two years with such toys as <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruxpin </PERSON>, the talking teddy bear, and Lazer Tag. But it reported large losses after it encountered production problems and failed to develop new hit toys. The company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 1987 after it was sued by creditors seeking payment. Worlds of Wonder hopes to file the reorganization plan in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> within the next few weeks and expects confirmation hearings to be held in April or May, said the company's general counsel, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> Once the plan is approved, a newly formed company headed by investor <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> would acquire Worlds of Wonder's assets for an undisclosed amount of cash, notes and preferred stock and continue to operate the company in Fremont under the same name, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` It allows the company to move forward with the plans for a revitalized business, which we developed over the past year,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, WOW's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. In addition to <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, the investment group includes <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Fisher-Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Ingram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION>. Proceeds from the sale would go to Worlds of Wonder's secured creditors, <ORGANIZATION> Algemene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nederland </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, lead bank for a group of five financial institutions, the company said. The company repeated its earlier announcement that current stockholders would not receive any money, and that their stock would be canceled. The new company would then issue its own stock, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Worlds of Wonder announced late last year it was talking with investors about a possible sale. The company has been negotiating the agreement with <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and the other investors for the past few weeks, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Just before it filed for Chapter 11 protection, Worlds of Wonder, which designs, develops, markets and distributes toys, employed about 500 people. About 120 people now work for the company.

<HEAD>Dole Says Too Soon For Bush Position On Eastern; Unions Plan for
Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Tuesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs more time to decide whether to accept an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> request that he intervene to block a threatened strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, intensified its preparations for a strike, asking its affiliated unions to assist the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union if it goes on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and to boycott its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The stakes are high and the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> deserves the most thorough support we can provide,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said in a letter to the unions. Outside Eastern headquarters in nearby <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers held a noon-hour rally as a show of solidarity with negotiators on their way to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Tuesday night for an intensive round of mediated contract talks. Speaking at the rally as if a strike were a certainty, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> promised, `` Anyone who gives services or aid and comfort to providing staff or help to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> owner -RRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in the strike pending here will suffer the wrath of organized labor.'' The 9,000 Eastern mechanics and ground workers are scheduled to strike March 4, but that deadline would automatically be pushed back 60 days if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named an emergency board to mediate the 16-month dispute. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was awaiting advice from the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and a recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on whether an emergency board was needed. The mediation board is coordinating talks scheduled to resume Wednesday. `` Give the president the opportunity to look at all the data first,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Eastern, which has asked the Machinists for $ 150 million a year in wage and other concessions, has said it plans to operate in the event of a strike. The union says the carrier has circulated memos asking supervisors for a list of managers scheduled for work March 4, training records and parts in stock. The machinists are seeking raises totaling $ 50 million, which means the two sides are $ 200 million apart. Labor leaders Monday promised to disrupt air travel and shipping in the event of a strike by picketing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and any air or ground carriers that have service agreements with Eastern.

<HEAD>Suit Claims Fairchild Unit Falsified Tests On Aircraft Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 200 million civil lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' Voi-Shan unit accuses the defense contractor of falsifying test results for nuts, bolts and rivets used in military and commercial planes. The suit was filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in May, but it remains sealed while the government considers joining the action, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times reported Tuesday. Fairchild spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> at the company's <LOCATION> Chantilly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters declined to comment on the suit. The news of the suit is the latest development in a controversy over aircraft parts made by <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that the company is suspected of supplying substandard parts to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that bear the approval stamp of a fictitious quality-control inspector. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said its own investigation turned up no problem with the Voi-Shan parts. Fairchild said last week that there have been no claims from customers that it shipped any unsafe fasteners. It said it was conducting its own investigation into the allegations. The allegations prompted a criminal investigation, which included a 48-hour search at the plant two weeks ago by federal authorities, both newspapers reported. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Runion </PERSON>, a former lab technician at the Voi-Shan plant in suburban <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, and two unidentified former employees filed the suit under the False Claims Act, which allows plaintiffs to win a part of any damages eventually awarded. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may join such suits as a plaintiff if it decides the allegations have merit. The suit alleges that Voi-Shan falsified the results of safety tests on its fasteners, including tests to assess the parts' durability under stress The criminal investigation is being pursued jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the newspapers said. According to an affidavit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether they used any fasteners for which tests are questionable. The alleged falsifications took place because `` necessary testing equipment was inoperative, the tests could not be accomplished in the available time due to backlogs or because parts from a particular lot failed a test, and it was decided by management to approve the parts anyway,'' the affidavit alleged. The probe led the <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to announce it is reconsidering its $ 230 million bid for Fairchild, the Times said.

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> family may sell off parts of <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> if it succeeds in its more than $ 330 million attempt to take over the camping equipment maker, according to a document filed Tuesday. The document filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> contained the clearest public statement of the family's intentions to date. Some analysts have speculated the $ 64-per-share offer from family members was intended to put the company on the auction block. Others said the family appeared to be serious about retaining control and may have made the offer as a defensive move to ward off other takeover attempts. The acquisition was undertaken `` in order to better enable the family and the company's management to focus attention on the long-term interests of the company,'' the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing said. The family proposed the leveraged buyout to the <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> board on Feb. 14. Selling some of the assets of the acquired company is a relatively common method of repaying money borrowed for debt-financed takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> document. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> stock continued trading heavily on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, closing Tuesday at $ 70.62 -LCB-, up 12 -LCB- cents. Average daily trading normally is 20,700 shares; On Tuesday, 108,300 shares changed hands. In its filing, the family said it reserves the right to take other action if its proposal fails. `` I think what they're saying is they do n't have a secondary plan, but they reserve the right to do anything else they darn well please,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, managing partner at the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, office of the <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accounting and consulting firm.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 48.4 million Tuesday for the three months ended Jan. 31, a 28.3 percent decline compared with the same period of 1988. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>, however, said the profit of $ 67.5 million reported in the 1988 period was inflated by a one-time gain. Earnings per share for the nation's largest farm-machinery maker declined to 65 cents for the three months ended Jan. 31, compared with 99 cents per share in the comparable quarter last year. Net income for last year's first quarter benefited from a one-time gain of $ 38 million from the adoption of new accounting rules for income taxes and tax losses that were carried forward, the company said. Worldwide net sales to dealers for this year's first quarter totaled $ 1.14 billion, up 9 percent from the $ 1.04 billion reported in the year-ago period. `` During January 1989, the company introduced to its agricultural equipment dealers a major line of new combines, large tractors and other equipment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>. `` The manufacturing startup of these new products resulted in some production and shipping delays as well as excess manufacturing costs which affected our North American operating results in the first quarter,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. `` Shipments to our dealers ... were approximately $ 75 million less than scheduled,'' he said. `` However, we expect to make up this shortfall in the second quarter.'' Retail sales for the period were relatively unchanged from first-quarter 1988, the company said. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> is optimistic abouts its prospects for this year. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said farmers' income, which hit a record high last year, was expected to be strong again in 1989. He said <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> also could benefit from reductions in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain surplus that had long dampened commodities prices. `` Additionally, land values have continued to increase, and the overall level of famers' indebtedness has been reduced significantly,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said.
