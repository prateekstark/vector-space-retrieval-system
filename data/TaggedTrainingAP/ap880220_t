 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will have to overcome <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s growing opposition if he expects the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace proposals to get anywhere. The 72-year-old prime minister, a former underground fighter and senior spymaster, has a reputation for being tough-minded. Aides say he will not yield to the pressure of negative publicity or diplomatic arm-twisting. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has expressed serious reservations, and some annoyance, about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ideas for reviving progress toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. To clear the air in advance of the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit next week, he sent emissaries to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to declare what he would and would not accept. One envoy was <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, a senior figure in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, who said he told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> the prime minister would not agree to territorial compromise in advance of peace talks `` Territory for peace is a non-starter,'' <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We are ready to negotiate on the territorial issue, but that does n't mean we are ready to accept withdrawing from the territories before negotiations.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suggested the land-for-peace formula in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and it apparently upset <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` The timing, manner and phrasing was inappropriate, inasmuch as he wants to have the prime minister in the process,'' <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said, adding that he believed the secretary of state realized his `` mistake.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan calls for: _ An international forum that would convene by April to launch Arab-Israeli negotiations. The Soviets would likely play an equal role with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. _ An interim solution for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in the form of self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there. Elections would be held by October to choose a self-governing body. _ Talks on the final status of the occupied lands to start by December even without progress on autonomy. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> initially indicated flexibility, to encourage negotiations, but the suggestion that he would agree to yield some of the occupied land caused a storm of protest among <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> hard-liners. Perhaps fearing concessions would be seen as giving in to Arab rioters, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has drawn back, with tougher rhetoric and warnings between the lines that he will not accept pressure from the Americans. He has been cool to Soviet involvement, requested a clearer definition of the forum that would launch negotiations, and expressed opposition to linking talks on a temporary solution in the occupied territories with negotiations on a permanent settlement. He argues that several years of experience with limited self-rule is needed to build confidence for a stable solution. `` There is a need for a considerable period of practical experience, of coexistence between us and the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> authorities before the question of sovereignty can be approached,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech this week. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will begin a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> shuttle Thursday after a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, using <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as a base and traveling to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and possibly other Arab countries, Israeli officials said. His most intensive shuttle, however, may be between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. The two partners and rivals in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition government and who disagree sharply on strategy for peace. `` They are miles apart,'' an official close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said privately. `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will try to bring them to together as he has in the past.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has endorsed <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s proposal for an international conference, which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says would be biased against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Labor accepts the land-for-peace formula but the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> fears giving up land would make <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> vulnerable. Aides to both leaders say <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will concentrate on winning <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s agreement, since <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> already has accepted the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan. `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s major goal is to convince <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>,'' one official said. A senior aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prime minister views the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit `` with caution'' but is ready to listen and give his position. `` Some of his -LRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s -RRB- ideas are okay and others are not,'' the aide said.

<TEXT>
 The reputed leader of a Chicago-area group called the Skinheads and five other alleged white supremacists were indicted Friday for attacking a woman and drawing a swastika on her wall with her blood. Authorities believe the defendants beat the 20-year-old woman, with whom they were acquainted, because she had black friends, state's attorney's spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The group's leader, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Martell </PERSON>, 28, and the others were charged with home invasion, robbery, theft and two counts of aggravated battery, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Arrested with them Jan. 25 was an unidentified 16-year-old whose indictment had been expected Friday but was delayed until later this month because a special hearing must be held to charge him as an adult, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The victim was not identified to protect her from members of the white supremacist group, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The suspects are accused of pushing their way into the woman's North Side apartment last April, forcing her to the floor and repeatedly punching and kicking her After her attackers sprayed a Mace-type chemical in her face, the woman managed to break free and lock herself in the bathroom, where she passed out, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The defendants allegedly ransacked her apartment, stole jewelry and clothing and drew swastikas throughout her home, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Most of the Nazi symbols were spray-painted or drawn with markers, but one swastika on the woman's living room wall was drawn with the victim's blood,'' Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Prosecutors believe the attack was motivated by the defendants' anger over the victim's friendship'' with blacks, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The victim had formerly associated with the Skinheads, she said. `` This type of crime, which is nothing more than vicious race hatred, will not be tolerated in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just as it can not be tolerated anywhere in our society,'' State's Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said in a statement. `` These defendants will be prosecuted to fullest extent of the law, as will anyone who dares to commit such a cowardly crime,'' he said. The home invasion charge, which is the most serious, has a maximum prison sentence of 30 years and a minimum of six years without probation, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The robbery charge can bring as much as seven years in prison and the theft and battery charges can bring as much as five-year terms each, she said. The others indicted were identified as <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON>, 18, her brother <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipp </PERSON>, 20, <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 20, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajdel </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, 26. They are scheduled to be arraigned March 11 before Chief Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. All except <PERSON> Martell </PERSON> are free on $ 50,000 bond. The state's attorney's office will seek to try the juvenile as an adult. <PERSON> Martell </PERSON> is scheduled to appear in court twice on charges stemming from separate racial attacks before the hearing on the latest indictments. Skinheads is a name some white supremacists across the nation have given themselves, in accordance with their practice of shaving their heads. But some people enjoy the music and fashion of the Skinheads without sharing their racist sentiments, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state's attorney's office.

<HEAD>Panama Indicates Interest in Deal on Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, apparently seeking a way out of a legal and diplomatic predicament with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, made discreet inquiries about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to drop federal charges against military strong man Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, administration officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Friday that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> authorities had asked about that possibility and that Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> raised the matter with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. After being told that dropping the charges was `` technically possible,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> relayed that message Wednesday to Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> during an unannounced meeting in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. But during their discussion, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> `` made no deal, offered no deal and was not in a position to offer a deal,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added that the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are `` obviously based on strong evidence, and we have every intention on carrying through with them.'' The Panamanian Embassy had no comment on the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> meeting, saying only that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had gone to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for medical treatment. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> denied an account in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> the indictment might be dropped if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> withdrew from politics and went into exile. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> cited as its sources <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and congressional staff members it did not name. The Panamanian inquiry was made as a political crisis grew in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, brought on in part by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s legal problems. Indictments handed down in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> two weeks ago portrayed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a key member of an international drug trafficking conspiracy. Among other activities, he was accused of providing protection and other government services to international drug smugglers who shipped cocaine and marijuana to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. U.S.-Panamanian agreements do not provide for his extradition, making it virtually impossible for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to be brought to trial. At the same time, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is deeply concerned about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political stability and has been encouraging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his military allies to withdraw from politics. The administration believes that the security of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> is best assured through elected civilian rule. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is widely viewed as a figurehead president who bows to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s wishes The Times account said that under the formula <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> discussed, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could move to any country he wished without having to concern himself with the possibility of extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> living in exile, this scenario also could enhance the possibility _ consistent with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objectives _ of an evolution to a civilian-led government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> insisted that the administration has no interest in any arrangement for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to be exiled in exchange for a drop of the charges. `` We all see the drug problem of tremendous importance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as throughout the hemisphere,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, reaffirming that the indictments will not be withdrawn.

 A federal prosecutor in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> says he was `` treated like the enemy'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and stymied by superiors in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office after he discovered <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Contra supply network. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, says in a sworn statement the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> `` turned white'' after learning what <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> knew in the spring of 1986 _ eight months before the Iran-Contra arms and money affair dominated the news. And <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> described months of unsuccessful efforts to take the investigation to the grand jury, with his boss telling him in August 1986 that `` politics'' was responsible for the delay. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, other prosecutors and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent unveiled the story of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> investigation in sworn statements to the congressional Iran-Contra committees. They were released this week by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> admitted he should have `` been more aggressive'' in pursuing the North network, `` because history has basically spoken.'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> and two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents went to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on March 31, 1986, to investigate an alleged murder plot against then-U. Ambassador <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambs </PERSON>. The prosecutor said the plot proved to be bogus, but he did obtain details about a private supply network for the U.S.-backed Contra rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said he made the information into a chart with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s name on the top North, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, directed the secret operations to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and aid the Contras despite a law prohibiting such assistance. `` The ambassador turned white,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said, describing <PERSON> Tambs </PERSON> after he was shown the chart. <PERSON> Tambs </PERSON> was identified in the Iran-Contra hearings as a key link in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s network. `` The only thing he said when I pulled out the chart was ` Get <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> in here.' The words are indelibly imprinted in my mind,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, `` knew he was dealing with three people -LRB- <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> and two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents -RRB- who had only seen the tip of an iceberg and was ... trying to rip the credibility of the various people who were making the allegations that we were exploring,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said he and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators with him in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> `` were being treated like the enemy'' for the rest of their stay. He added, `` I felt perhaps we were being watched.'' Throughout the spring and summer of 1986, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> asked his boss, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, to allow the case to go to a grand jury. But <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> _ who at the time did not realize the full significance of what he had discovered _ said he was stalled for months by <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> and other top assistants in the office. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>'s assistants said the case was n't far enough along to move to the grand jury. And on Aug. 29, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> told him, `` politics are involved.'' The secret sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Contras did n't dominate public attention until Nov. 25, 1986, after a Lebanese news magazine disclosed secret negotiations over American hostages between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, in his deposition, acknowledged telling <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> that politics were causing a delay, but denied that he was referring to the discovery of North's network. Instead, <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said he referred to allegations he received from pro-Contra mercenaries that aides to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> were paying informants to lie. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> admitted he did not tell <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> about these allegations when he used the word `` politics'' _ but <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> decided not to give the case to the grand jury without first discussing these allegations with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, who then was 29 years old, acknowledged in his statement that he did not focus on <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was directing the Iran-Contra effort. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said he thought the case was mainly about paramilitary groups illegally aiding the Contras. `` For the most part, the case is about people in private organizations, basically on their own, going out and recruiting help for the -LRB- Contras -RRB- or putting their own little paramilitary groups together,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Boost in Pork, Poultry Output Should Temper Retail Price Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retail food prices will rise more slowly this year than last year's 4.2 percent increase, mainly because of a sharp increase in meat production, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The forecast, however, is based on an expected jump in pork and poultry production, which should more than offset a drop in beef output in figuring retail food prices, according to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report issued this week. That does not necessarily mean any boon for consumers unwilling to forgo beef in favor of pork and poultry. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> already is hailing a decline of 3 million head in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> herd as of Jan. 1 to 99 million as a `` bullish'' signal for increased beef prices. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says red meat production in 1987 totaled 38,449,000 pounds and poultry 19,765,000 pounds. Consumption of red meat and poultry combined was 216.7 pounds per capita last year. The forecast issued this week said red meat production this year should reach 38,345,000 pounds and poultry 20,935,000. It estimated per capita consumption at 221.9 pounds. Retail food prices last year were 333 percent of their 1967 level, according to the report. The report did not attempt to estimate precisely how much they would climb over the year ahead but merely said the increase would be less than that of 1987. The report also said hog profits fell sharply in the final quarter of 1987 and probably will continue to drop this year. Net returns could average only slightly above the break-even point, it said.

 Overseas sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat climbed sharply last week, primarily because of Soviet, Chinese and Moroccan purchases, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. Soybean and sorghum sales also climbed, but corn, barley and cotton fell compared with the four-week average, the department said. Wheat sales hit 1,178,100 metric tons. The Soviets purchased 308,500 tons, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 299,000 tons and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> 220,800 tons, the department said. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said sales of sorghum totaled 347,100 tons, the most in the current marketing year. The increase was attributed mainly to purchases by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Soybean sales of 589,500 tons were 56 percent over the previous week's mark and 72 percent above the four-week average. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the main purchaser, followed by <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Corn sales fell to 777,400 tons, 14 percent below the previous week and 44 percent lower than the four-week average, despite substantial purchases by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Barley sales were down, with <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> purchasing all of the 25,000 tons sold last week. According to the report, cotton sales totaled 55,700 bales, 13 percent below the previous week's mark and 50 percent off from the four-week average. Rice sales of 23,900 tons were 56 percent above the previous week but 46 percent below the four-week average. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> were the main purchasers. Among other commodities, soybean cake and meal sales were up for the week but still well short of the four-week average, while soybean oil sales were down. Sales of hides and skins were lower for the week but a shade above the four-week average.

<HEAD>Koop Emphasizes Risk To Heterosexuals From AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says public health officials agree that heterosexuals are at risk for contracting AIDS, despite recent published accounts that give the impression heterosexuals are relatively safe. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said Friday that several articles, including one in Cosmopolitan magazine, wrongly led women and heterosexual men to believe they are not at risk. `` The risk is real,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health. `` It is just not true that there is no danger from normal vaginal intercourse. What is unknown is the level of danger. There is always a danger whenever people engage in casual sex outside the marriage relationship, even if their promiscuity is heterosexual.'' As of Feb. 15, there were 53,814 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. About 65 percent were in homosexual or bisexual males, and 17 percent were in intravenous drug abusers. While only 4 percent of current AIDS cases are reported among heterosexuals, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said that proportion is expected to rise to 5 percent in the 1990s. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the subcommittee that medical personnel generally have responded well to the AIDS crisis. But he said there is a minority of medical personnel who `` refuse not only to treat persons with AIDS, but also turn away patients alleged to be from population groups identified with those two high-risk behaviors: that is, homosexual and bisexual males and intravenous drug abusers.'' He characterized that behavior as `` unworthy of anyone in the health or social service professions.'' Those who turn away AIDS patients use the excuse that the disease is fatal and contagious, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` But the plain fact is that the risk of contracting -LRB- AIDS -RRB- from an infected patient is extremely small and nearly always preventable.'' Of nearly 7 million health professionals in the country, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, fewer than a dozen became infected with the AIDS virus while doing their jobs and, in most cases, that exposure could have been prevented if the person had followed guidelines published five years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, another witness, said more than 15 million Americans are being tested anonymously each year for AIDS through blood banks and the military and in 30 communities. He said more anonymous testing should be done to get a better fix on the extent of AIDS infection in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but he rejected Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>'s idea that anyone coming in contact with the health system be tested. <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, R-Calif., has introduced legislation that would require testing of hospital patients, clinic patients, marriage license applicants and others He also wants to require reporting by name of any positive test results. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> endorsed the general approach sponsored by subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., which includes voluntary testing, confidentiality and anti-discrimination protection for those with the disease or virus `` Where there's worry about confidentiality or discrimination, there's a chilling effect,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Kerry Suggests U.S. Military Intervention In Colombian Drug Wars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American military intervention may be needed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to halt the flow of narcotics to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> says. `` We've gotten to the point where we have to be prepared to be tough. We can not be patsies about this stuff,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat said Friday. `` We ought to make it permanently hot for them down there.'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should provide <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with helicopters, communications equipment and other military systems to combat the region's drug czars. He said an estimated 80 percent of the narcotics entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> come from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. But the senator added that military assistance may not be enough and that the administration should be willing to send troops to the area, if necessary, to help <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> agents. `` I'm willing, and I think we ought to consider, the use of our <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> forces to assist in the interdiction effort on a case-by-case basis. They ought to be able to do that because what you have here is literally a paramilitary organization that you're fighting against,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> told reporters `` This is a very sophisticated effort we're working against, and if it takes the visibility of our military force ... that's worth it to me,'' he added. Last April, 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers were sent to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to help train Bolivian anti-drug police. In July 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent 175 soldiers provide logistical support for Bolivian anti-drug operations. That program ended in November 1986. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> released a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, urging the immediate transfer of $ 50 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which is charged largely with battling drug trafficking at sea <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> lambasted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a series of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts. `` I'm tired of this phony war on drugs where they talk about it, where they stand <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- up at the State of the Union message and try to pretend the war on drugs is rampaging across the country, and meanwhile they cut the guts out of the law enforcement effort. That type of hypocrisy has simply got to stop,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. He also called for a tightening of banking regulations for cash transactions and increasing penalties for drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> are lauding a Western effort to build a common arms control strategy so <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> can manage the Soviets with `` realism, strength and alliance unity.'' The two leaders ended talks at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday with a pledge to intensify the effort at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit March 2-3. `` What we need now is an overall concept covering the whole field of disarmament, and there I do not see any difference between us and the Americans,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters before heading back to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` We agreed that we must deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from a position of realism, strength and alliance unity,'' Since reaching agreement with the Soviets to eliminate land-based nuclear missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,125 miles, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies have been trying to set goals for further talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his aides. `` We want to get out of a situation where we merely react to proposals which have been submitted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. We want to put down proposals and let him react to them,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who attended the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting, left later in the day for another round of negotiations with the Soviets in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> pledged to convey to the Soviets the West German concern about ethnic Germans facing discrimination in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> bloc countries. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> already has agreed on a first priority of a U.S.-Soviet reduction in long-range missiles and bombers, while seeking cuts in conventional and chemical weapons. `` We were in agreement that all these disarmament questions and issues as well as the necessary measures to preserve our common security should be combined in form and overall concept for our alliance,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Each of the 16 allies, depending on its politics and geography, has different interests to advance, and one of the key differences was reflected in comments after <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is particularly eager for negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear weapons _ those with ranges below 300 miles _ and wants those talks included in any conferences that deal with conventional weapons. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose country would be threatened by such weapons if a war broke out in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, reiterated the desire for quick and comprehensive talks on the short-range systems. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which believes tactical nuclear weapons are necessary to deter a conventional attack, wants to defer negotiations to reduce the short-range systems. Indeed, it is working on plans to modernize these weapons, with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> approval. During <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit, the two sides sought to minimize the importance of the disagreement. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he did not favor the elimination of the tactical nuclear weapons: artillery shells and short-range missiles. He does not seek a `` denuclearized zone, least of all in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was asked at the news conference about concerns that modernization of short-range weapons would touch off protests like those that rocked <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the early 1980s after <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decided to deploy intermediate-range weapons. `` I do n't share that fear,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. In its efforts to play down the issue, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration noted during <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit that further study is needed before the most powerful of the short-range systems _ a missile to replace the 75-mile-range Lance _ is deployed and it may not go into operation before 1995.

<HEAD>Gingrich To Ask House Ethics Committee To Investigate Speaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, contending that published reports have outlined `` clear violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules'' by Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, says he intends to ask the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee next month to launch a formal investigation. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., told a news conference Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> needs to know the truth about the allegations of corruption that have been leveled at <LOCATION> Wright </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, in news accounts over the past decade `` We're going to have to at least at a minimum insist that we find out what the truth is, and on March 3, I intend to create that opportunity,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office did not return a telephone call Friday seeking comment on <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s plan to seek an ethics committee investigation. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said two specific published reports about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> provide clear evidence that he violated House rules. One involved <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s failure since 1980 to file the required financial disclosure reports for a company in which he is a partner. The other involved 55 percent royalties <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received for a book published by a friend whose printing company worked for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign committee. House rules prohibit members from receiving royalties in excess of `` the usual and customary value for such services,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, and most authors receive royalties of 6 percent to 8 percent. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the ethics panel also should investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s connection to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan association officials who are under investigation by federal authorities The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month accused <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and a political action committee he heads of mail fraud and asked the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to investigate. The <ORGANIZATION> DCCC </ORGANIZATION> said the PAC collected more than $ 200,000 through mail solicitations of contributions for conservative candidates, but provided only $ 3,000 to such candidates. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who has denied the accusations, said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> DCCC </ORGANIZATION> complaint was a `` smoke screen'' designed to discredit him politically so he could not pursue the ethics complaints against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Under House rules, any member can ask the ethics panel to investigate another member. The committee, composed of six Democrats and six Republicans, can reject such a request only by a majority vote. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said it would be `` inconceivable'' that the committee would refuse to investigate the allegations. But if that happens, he said he intends to force the issue on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor with a series of privileged votes that could tie up <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> business. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully last year to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to create an outside commission to investigate ethics complaints against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other Democratic leaders. He said he was announcing his intention to seek an investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> now to give other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members time to familiarize themselves with the long list of allegations. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has criticized the ethics committee in the past for its lenient treatment of Democrats accused of wrongdoing. But he said Friday he has more confidence in the panel after its recent votes to reprimand one Democratic congressman and recommend the expulsion of another. He said he believes the panel can conduct a fair investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> if it will agree to hire an outside attorney acceptable to both <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders and to complete its investigation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for the year.

<TEXT>
 A proposed merger between two of the nation's largest manufacturers of glass containers remains on hold today in the wake of a ruling by a federal appeals court Late Friday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issued an administrative stay of a lower court decision that would have cleared the way for the merger between <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brockway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had asked the appeals court to extend until next Tuesday a restraining order blocking the merger until the agency could decide whether to appeal a ruling by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> refused the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had not proven the deal would harm competition. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tichnor </PERSON> said the agency will have until next Tuesday to file an appeal and that the court will issue a decision sometime after <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> files a response Wednesday. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> said there is no excuse for the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` unusual filing'' Friday to keep the merger on hold until the agency can decide whether to appeal. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has been acutely aware since the beginning of this case of the extreme time sensitivity surrounding the merger and, in that regard, has had ample time to prepare for the possibility of a decision adverse to it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. Last September, the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, Ohio-based <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> proposed to buy <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for $ 750 million, or $ 60 per share. The merger would make the combined company the largest manufacturer of glass containers in the industry. The nation's top manufacturer is <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which controls 23.7 percent of the market. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has said the merger might violate federal antitrust laws by substantially reducing competition in the glass container industry and creating conditions for price discrimination. It wants to halt the merger until it can conduct an administrative review of the proposal. But <PERSON> Green </PERSON> accepted the argument advanced by the two manufacturers that competition from the plastics and metal-packaging industry will hold down prices.

<HEAD>Contra-Sandinista Peace Talks End Over Democracy, Truce</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Peace talks between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and Contra rebels are right back where they began _ mired in a dispute over what comes first, democracy or a truce. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leader who has been mediating the negotiations, abruptly suspended the latest round of talks Friday, indirectly blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for their failure. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said he was disappointed that both sides had not accepted, at least in principle, a proposal he put forth Thursday in an attempt to break a deadlock that arose in the first hours of the talks. That impasse stemmed from what the cardinal said was the inability of the two sides to agree on whether they should negotiate a cease-fire to obtain democracy, or negotiate democracy to obtain a cease-fire. More than 40,000 people have been killed since November 1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government. The cardinal's plan called on the Contras to accept a truce in exchange for four major concessions by the government. They were concessions the Contras have long sought, and they quickly accepted the proposal in principle. But <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, said the cardinal suspended the talks in mid-afternoon Friday before he could deliver his government's formal, written response, which also conditionally accepted the plan. The confusion apparently arose because President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> initially instructed his negotiators to reject <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s proposal as unsuitable for discussion at talks the Sandinista leader felt should be aimed solely at the mechanics of achieving a cease-fire The government apparently changed its mind later and authorized <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> to accept conditionally the cardinal's plan. By then, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> had suspended the negotiations without setting a time or place for a new round of talks. Contra negotiators announced their tentative acceptance of <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s proposal at a news conference Thursday night. Shortly afterward, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters the plan was `` interesting and constructive,'' but needed clarification. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, attorney advising the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> advised the government negotiators during a telephone conference later Thursday evening to reject <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s proposal. <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as saying that if <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> felt the issues he raised in his proposal were of vital importance to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> people, the president would discuss them with the cardinal personally. But <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s initial reaction was that he would not discuss political issues at the bargaining table with the Contras _ a position the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> leader has long held. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s plan called for the Contras to move into unspecified `` enclaves or zones'' with their arms and equipment during a 30-day truce, during which talks would continue toward a more lasting cease-fire. In exchange, the cardinal called on the Nicaraguan government to: _ Grant a `` full, general'' amnesty to the several thousand political prisoners in Nicaraguan jails, including members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> of former dictator Gen. <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, whom the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> overthrew in 1979 _ Permit `` unrestricted'' freedom of the press, a right now granted only to a few mass media, including the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, the voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ `` Reconsider'' mandatory military draft law, which has provoked violent disturbances by youths and mothers of draft-age people in several Nicaraguan cities. _ Reopen a dialogue with its internal opposition, including 14 dissident political parties and a coalition of business, labor and political groups known as the Democratic Coordinating Council Those talks broke down late last year. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>'s initial response and the government's later written statement said the <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> plan needed clarification on the size and location of the cease-fire zones, when the truce would start, how it would be verified and how the Contras would be supplied during the cessation of hostilities. <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conflict </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, draw up a new cease-fire proposal, drawing on plans already submitted by both sides. But in announcing suspension of the talks, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> issued a communique rejecting <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s participation in the negotiations. The communique said such work was the proper task of each side's technical advisers

<HEAD>Ariane Rocket To Put American, French Satellites Into Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A European Ariane rocket will launch an American and a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> satellite into orbit next month from the program's <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION> space center, the commercial arm of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced The March 11 launch from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> base is to be Ariane's 21st and the first of eight planned for this year. It is to lift the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spacenet </ORGANIZATION> 3-R satellite and the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> 1C into orbit, <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> said in its announcement Friday. The 20th Ariane shot on Nov. 20 placed the West German satellite TV-SAT1 into orbit. The launch was flawless, but one of the satellite's solar panels failed to deploy and it has not been able to carry out its function of direct television broadcasts. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle program was suspended after the January 1986 Challenger disaster, making the Ariane program the West's only regular vehicle for the lucrative satellite-launching market.

 <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> is the stroke capital of the world, and heavy drinking and cold weather could be partly to blame, researchers say. Soviet stroke data, gathered as part of a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> program, were released for the first time Friday at a stroke conference sponsored by the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were surprised,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Asplund </PERSON>. `` We thought that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be the higest.'' The study showed that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> are the safest places to live, at least as far as stroke is concerned, although the stroke rate is low throughout most of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Asplund </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Umea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Umea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, said the data suggest that strokes must have several causes. While racial differences may play a role, they do n't explain all of the variations in the risk of stroke around the world. The study found that in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the stroke rate was 119 for every 100,000 men and 107 for every 100,000 women. These figures were the highest in the world and significantly ahead of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the country with the second highest stroke rate. Strokes are also common in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but data collected there were so sparse they were not included in the analysis. Strokes among men are least common in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where they strike 21 in 100,000. In women they are least frequent in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, where they occur in 8 in 100,000. Asked why strokes are so common in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Asplund </PERSON> said, `` At this point, we can only guess. We know that alcohol consumption is very high. High alcohol use among men is associated with a high risk for stroke. I also suspect that there are some climate factors involved.'' Although there are exceptions, such as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he said it appears that strokes are more common in cold climates than in milder places. He noted that people are more likely to suffer strokes in northern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> than in southern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Some experts suspect that Asians are more likely to suffer strokes, at least in part, because of racial differences. However, <PERSON> Asplund </PERSON> said that most people in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> moved there from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It's not only a racial thing,'' he said. `` It must have other determinants as well. The goal of this study is to find the determinants of the huge variations in stroke around the world.'' He said the researchers will be trying to learn why the stroke rate is falling rapidly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while it is stable or increasing in many other countries. The study found that in most places, strokes are more common in men than in women. The only exceptions to this were <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where strokes are slightly more common among women. The 10-year project, called Monitoring of Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease, or MONICA, is being conducted in 26 countries and will conclude in 1994.

 Contra rebels claim they downed a Soviet-made Sandinista air force helicopter in eastern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with a U.S.-made Redeye missile this week. The rebels, in a statement released in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> Friday, said they used the heat-seeking anti-aircraft weapon last Sunday to shoot down the MI-17 helicopter in Chontales province. In the Nicaraguan capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied the rebel claim, saying mechanical failure caused the crash. The spokesman demanded anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had reported on Monday that seven people were killed in the crash, which occurred near the village of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomas </LOCATION>, about 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The Contras claimed 15 people. Sandinista authorities said the helicopter was carrying new currency to the region to be exchanged for old bills. The Contra statement said the rebels recovered 10 million new cordobas in the crash. The Contras say they downed 26 helicopters with Redeye missiles last year. Foreign military observers put the number at a dozen. The Sandinistas admitted to six.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> should not be penalized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> despite their failure to take adequate steps to control drug trafficking, according to a draft <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report.

Under a 1986 law, the president certifies countries that are `` fully cooperating'' in cracking down on the drug trade.

The report charged that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have n't made adequate progress in combating the drug trade but said they should be certified, the Times reported. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and some of his aides were indicted this month on drug and racketeering charges. `` It's ridiculous and stupid, absolutely ludicrous, and sends the wrong signals to both countries,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said of the report's recommendation.

 Three hospitals turned down the liver of a brain-dead baby whose body was being maintained on life-support systems to preserve his organs for transplant, officials said Friday. <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who was born Tuesday with most of his brain missing, a condition known as anencephaly, was pronounced brain dead Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. No other cases in which anencephalics have been kept on life-support for organ transplant have been announced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, chief of <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s heart transplant program, last year suggested there have been such infants. Doctors plan to maintain the body on life support for up to seven days in hope of finding recipients for its organs, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. One liver transplant candidate in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was not an appropriate match and another in that city became infected, delaying any transplant, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. A medical center in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> also was unable to accept the liver for another candidate because it had committed itself to do another transplant and could not perform two in one day, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> turned rejected the liver as not an ideal candidate for their recipient, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. Anencephaly usually is fatal within days after birth. An anencephalic infant's organs can be transplanted only if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infant on life-support from birth.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give favorable treatment to banks that take part in the government's new program to exchange part of its foreign debt for long-term bonds, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Finance Secretary <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> said in a statement that he discussed the plan with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recent meeting with President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> `` The Mexican delegation,'' the statement said, `` emphasized that it is necessary that all parties involved continue working in the search for deeper and more permanent solutions to the problem of the foreign debt and financing.'' It said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials acknowledged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in restructuring foreign debt and in fashioning <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s new debt exchange program. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of $ 105 billion, the second highest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The new program involves exchanging some of the debt <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that will be issued by the government. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has set Feb. 26 as the date for an auction of the bonds. The bonds will be backed by $ 10 billion worth of special securities to be issued this year by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is expected to pay about $ 2 billion for the 20-year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zero-coupon bonds, which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp discount of their face value. The government statement said <PERSON> Petricioli </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION> meeting `` that they give the most favorable treatment possible to the banks that decide to participate in this operation.'' Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks reportedly have expressed concern about taking part in the program because they are unhappy that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will continue obtaining loans at 100 percent of their value while paying back, through the bond program, its old loans at about half their value. They also are reportedly reluctant to accept losses of 50 percent or so on the loans entered into years ago, and worry about government regulations concerning accounting for the securities on their books. Most of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s about 600 creditor banks have authorized the government to go ahead with the auction, which would apply to $ 51 billion of the foreign debt. Under the program, banks would exchange their old debt for the new bonds, letting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in the secondary market. That means that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could retire part of its debt for half its face value. By reducing its debt, the government will also pare the amount of interest it pays each year on the loans. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has annual interest charges of $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to add some Midwestern momentum to his win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, was pushed by Democratic presidential rivals to defend his economic policies and complained during a debate that `` my name was taken in vain.'' Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, also found himself in the cross fire Friday during the latest debate of Democratic presidential candidates, as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked if the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman was `` proud of your vote for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tax cut in 1981.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, were the biggest targets in a debate that was freewheeling but less fiesty than a jangling exchange among the candidates in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> the day before. The St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> debate came as the focus of the presidential campaign shifted briefly away from the Super Tuesday battlefield mainly in the South and returned to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> hold contests on Tuesday. Though the delegates at stake from those two contests pale next to those to be allocated in the South, the closely bunched candidates are looking for a Midwestern edge to propel them toward the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses. In the latest debates, the candidates tried to block <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from gaining more momentum. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was hit on trade and taxes, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was forced to defend his budget plans. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> defended his overall tax voting record, saying most of the tax cut derided by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` went to ordinary people.'' `` That was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> countered. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agreed: `` It was n't just a bad vote as a matter of tax policy, it was the worst trade bill ever passed.'' The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> debate drew five of the six Democratic contenders. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was absent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fired one of the most direct shots of the debate at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s trade policies, warning that `` we've got to do more than wave a fist at our foreign competitors.'' But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> queried: `` Why is everyone defending unfair trade practices?'' After the candidates' exchange was interrupted by a moderator, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> predicted `` we'll never finish on trade.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> complained that `` my name was taken in vain'' by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who demanded to know why <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had not followed his example and released a budget proposal. `` The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because they do n't want to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the facts,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced a budget,'' retorted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Turning to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> asked, `` Why do n't you put your budget out, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>?'' When a moderator interrupted the exchange with a joke about `` exchange your budgets tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> complained: `` I thought that's what we were here to debate.'' The candidates paid homage to former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, one of the ceremonial sponsors of the debate, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> saying that <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s call for a tax hike during his failed 1984 Democratic presidential bid was `` to his everlasting credit.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> noted that this campaign is the first in 20 years that Minnesotans do n't have a favorite son candidate to vote for. `` Do n't despair, let me be your favorite son,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I want to be your other favorite son'' interjected <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. Friday's debate was sponsored by a series of groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> and radio and television station <ORGANIZATION> WCCO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>French Bomb Expert Wraps Up 43-year Career With One Last Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAEN, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON> cleared <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> of German mines the day after the Allies stormed it on D-Day, and went on to make a career out of defusing or detonating unexploded World War II bombs. On Friday, The 66-year-old <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON> retired with a bang, safely exploding a 300-pound English bomb found in January in this town 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The live bomb could n't be moved and was detonated near the center of town, causing no damage. In his last year as head of the regional bomb and mine clearing service, the man considered the dean of the 25 civil defense explosive experts in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was kept busy. `` In the second half of 1987, we received 560 calls to neutralize bombs found by individuals,'' <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON> said. He says his work in his later years was safer than it used to be. `` In 1945, we probed mine fields with bayonettes,'' he recalled. `` In two years, 27 French mine clearers died, and that's not counting the German prisoners of war we used.'' To determine if the bomb detonated Friday was still live, <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON> used sophisticated X-ray equipment, similar to that used at nuclear power plants, to see inside to the strike-pin. <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> was the scene of the Allied invasion in 1944 and saw intense fighting that left behind thousands of bombs and mines that often turn up unexpectedly. In the past year, bombs have been found by workers digging the English Channel tunnel and near a hospital in <LOCATION> Caen </LOCATION>. The most dangerous explosives still scattered throughout the verdant countryside are small anti-personnel bombs dropped in bunches from German planes. `` A woman had her leg torn away in June and a child died in September from these bombs,'' said <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON>, who added that he has found `` several thousand'' bombs and mines in four decades of work. <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON>'s first task was clearing the German mines from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> the day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces landed on June 6, 1944. `` I was the first French soldier on the beach and even before the second soldier arrived I had found hundreds and hundreds of mines,'' he said. <PERSON> Piattier </PERSON> was lucky to reach retirement. In the past two years, six of his colleagues have died in the line of duty, he said. `` My wife is happy. She thinks I'll be safe now at home, but I'm not so sure,'' he said `` I'd like to stay in contact with the service and help out when I can.''

<HEAD>Broadway-Bound Musical Gets Wan Reviews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Carrie,'' the $ 7 million Broadway-bound musical based on the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> novel, received tepid reviews following its premiere at the Royal Shakespeare Theater in <LOCATION> Stratford-upon-Avon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON> in the Daily Mail called the show, scheduled to open April 27 at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Theater, `` an expensive mess.'' But he praised 17-year-old newcomer <PERSON> Linzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> as the telekinetic <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> of the title, a traumatized adolescent played by <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON> in the 1976 film version of the book. `` I hope sincerely that Broadway takes Miss <PERSON> Hateley </PERSON> to its heart. It can take the rest wherever it pleases,'' <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON> wrote of Thursday's performance. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> in The Standard thought the show, presented in association with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, lacked `` that element of supernatural awe'' that made the movie memorable. He added: `` If ` <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>' has to be transformed into a musical, -LRB- director -RRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hands </PERSON> has probably done it as well as it can be done. But one has to ask whether the idea and the production were really necessary.'' Originally mooted for Broadway several years back, the show is now headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in a cast made up equally of Britons and Americans under a special arrangement with the actors' union, Equity. The behind-the-scenes talent is of mixed nationality, as well. Choreographer <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, composer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and lyricist <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> are all American. Director Hands and his design team _ <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Koltai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> _ are British. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coveney </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the musical was `` enjoyable in a masochistic way,'' but lamented Hands' participation in `` an utter cultural vacuum of dance studio robotics with a hint of cultural and classical pretensions. <PERSON> Coveney </PERSON> and the other critics all had kind words for Broadway veteran <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>'s mother <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, the religious fanatic played on-screen by <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coveney </PERSON> said the 60-year-old Miss <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> was `` superb,'' and Tinker called her `` Broadway's reclaimed heroine.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardle </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said the voices of <LOCATION> Linzi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hateley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> provided `` the most thrilling sounds of the evening.'' `` Carrie'' is the second mother-daughter musical to open back-to-back locally. Wednesday night saw the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> debut at the <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> Theater of `` The Rink,'' the 1984 Broadway flop that starred <PERSON> Chita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bow received mixed marks for the material _ a maudlin reconciliation drama set in an abandoned roller skating rink _ but praise for the two leads: <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Langton </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> refused to back either presidential candidate in Sunday's runoff elections after he lost a bid for a third term, throwing wide open <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' most hotly contested vote <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>'s centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Diko </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that it did not agree with the stands of either <PERSON> Glafcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or millionaire businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, an independent backed by the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Akel. That left <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>'s 91,000 supporters free to vote either way. <ORGANIZATION> Diko </ORGANIZATION>'s surprise move came after days of backroom bargaining. Rivals were eliminated in a first-round ballot last Sunday. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>'s third-place showing last Sunday took him out of the race. The small socialist party, Edek, announced it was putting the 9.4 percent of the vote it won Sunday behind <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> in a leftist alliance. On paper, that guarantees <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> just under 40 percent of the vote when this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island's 363,000-strong Greek Cypriot electorate votes. <PERSON> Vassilou </PERSON> gathered 30.11 percent of last Sunday's vote The conservative, pro-Western <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>, 68, a veteran political warhorse, topped Sunday's poll with 33.32 percent. But he will have to secure at least two-thirds of the votes <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> won to edge ahead of <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> this Sunday. The election has developed into a straight left-right battle. For the first time in a Cypriot presidential contest since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1960, the outcome can not be predicted. Political analysts believe the <ORGANIZATION> Diko </ORGANIZATION> vote will split roughly down the middle, with just a slight swing toward <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>. That may not be enough to ensure him victory. The election has been dominated by the partition issue. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in July 1974 after a short-lived coup by militant Greek Cypriot supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The Turks overran the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriot minority declared a breakaway republic in 1983. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> has pledged that if elected, he will form an all-party government of national unity to revive deadlocked negotiations between <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' Greek and Turkish communities to reunite the island. Seeking to strengthen his national unity strategy, <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> announced in a television debate Thursday night that he was resigning as leader of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> to head into Sunday's showdown poll as an independent <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> dismissed that as an electoral ploy and pointed out that the other three parties have rejected <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>' coalition proposal as unfeasible. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, 56, earlier concentrated in knocking <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> out of the race and blocking his election for a third five-year term. With <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> out of the way, they are now slamming each other. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> is accused of being a `` right-wing, anti-labor reactionary'' who heads a party that harbors the extremists who were behind the ill-starred 1974 coup that briefly ousted <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' first president, the late Archbishop <PERSON> Makarios </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> rejects the charge and accuses <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, a self-made millionaire making his first foray into politics, of being a communist pawn. Both men, however, support the unconditional resumption of negotiations with the Turkish side. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> had insisted that talks should resume only after the withdrawal of the 35,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 settlers shipped to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from the Turkish mainland. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> also demand a Turkish withdrawal, but do not make this a precondition for talks that have been stalled for the last three years. Taverns and most restaurants will remain closed from noon today until noon Monday in compliance with a law banning sale of alcohol at election time.

<TEXT>
 Senior conservatives are growing uneasy about the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> backing President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who for the first time in an opinion poll did not muster the support of a majority of Austrian voters. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Salzburger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nachrichten </ORGANIZATION> today published a survey showing 45 percent of those who responded to the poll favored <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s resignation and 42 percent wanted him to stay. It said 31 percent of the respondents said they would vote for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` by all means'' if presidential elections were held, while 42 percent replied they would `` by no means'' elect him. The newspaper said 522 people were polled on Feb. 18-19, but it was not known how representative was the sample nor give the margin of error. In previous polls, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> always had obtained the support of a majority of respondents. In an interview published in today's issue of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukacka </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying that, for now at least, the party would give <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> full backing. But <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> must work `` to reduce his credibility deficits by an information strategy,'' the newspaper reported <PERSON> Kukacka </PERSON> as saying. Early this summer the party will decide whether it `` makes sense'' to further stand by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> or to `` signal a certain distance,'' <PERSON> Kukacka </PERSON> said in the interview. <PERSON> Kukacka </PERSON> pledged his party would do everything to strengthen the president's position, but noted <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has a responsibility to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, `` so that all of us get out'' of the crisis. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but received its nomination in the June 8, 1986, presidential runoff, which he won with almost 54 percent of the vote. In a late Friday night television interview, <PERSON> Kukacka </PERSON> confirmed his comments published by <PERSON> Die </PERSON> <PERSON> Presse </PERSON>. `` The federal president has not yet sufficiently responded to the contents of the report of the historians' commission, while, on the other hand, a pressure of opinion, as it were ... was generated in the whole world,'' he said on the television. The historians' report presented no clear evidence to back allegations <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was directly involved in war crimes when he was a lieutenant with the German army in the occupied <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. But the report left open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime. It said he was `` in close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, knew about them and did nothing to prevent them. The president must put forward all his arguments to restore his credibility, said <PERSON> Kukacka </PERSON>. After a conservative national leadership caucus Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s main defender, said the president's decision to remain in office must be respected. The conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Oberoesterreichische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nachrichten </ORGANIZATION> in Friday editions said segments of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` are crumbling away'' over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, senior partner in the government coalition with the conservatives, has refrained from openly calling on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to step down. But party officials have made clear they see his resignation as the best solution to the standoff. In an interview published in today's editions of the West German conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said, `` -LRB- My -RRB- resignation from the office would throw the country into chaos.'' He said resigning would give the impression that `` not Austrian voters but foreign media and groups decide who may be Austrian head of state.'' Mock, who is vice chancellor and foreign minister in the coalition government, apparently is coming under increasing pressure from <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> critics in his party. `` Mock is the keystone in this issue. He can not move any more. If he were gone it would be easier'' to resolve the controversy over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the party caucus. Meanwhile, public protests against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> continued throughout <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Those calling for his resignation Friday included actors of a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> theater and civil servants in four ministries. Various petitions with signatures calling on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to quit are circulating in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and elsewhere, including two separate lists of conservative and Socialist university professors.

 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, the Mexican newspaper publisher, has announced he has sold his control of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. He said the former president of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> will take over direct operational control of the company. The transaction took the form of a sale by the Mexican media executive of an `` irrevocable proxy'' of his stock ownership in <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, in an announcement moved on its news wires Friday night, said the transfer is effective immediately The announcement said <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> relinquished his control over the news service in return for `` present and future financial considerations totaling more than $ 55 million.'' <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> bought <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> for $ 41 million in June 1986, ending bankruptcy court proceedings that began in April 1985, when the news service filed for protection from creditors. The announcement did not identify the owners of WNW. <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he believed <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is an independent company with no connection to <ORGANIZATION> FNN </ORGANIZATION> but said he did not really know anything about them at this point. An irrevocable proxy represents a transfer of voting power represented by the ownership shares but not the shares themselves. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> `` considers his task of investment in <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> completed at this time.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said additional details would be released at a news conference, probably on Monday. The agreement under which <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> acquired <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> after creditors approved a reorganization plan limited his ability to sell his interest in <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> without first giving an employees stock ownership plan the right of first refusal during a 60-day period. The <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> announcement said that the new president of the news service will be <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a 24-hour cable TV distributor of business news. The announcement said he would have `` total operational control of day-to-day management.'' The announcement identified the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as Dr. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, but provided no further identification. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>'s statement said, `` This step was necessary because I could not devote a sufficient amount of time to hands-on management. I am pleased that in this agreement, we have assured the continuation of a venerable world news gathering and independent journalistic organization.'' In addition to <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> announcement also listed three directors of <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Three hospitals have turned down the liver of a brain-dead baby whose body was being maintained on life-support machines today, and tests indicated the organ was failing, a hospital spokeswoman said. The 7-pound infant known as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> was born Tuesday with most of its brain missing, and was pronounced dead two days later at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The baby was the first brain-absent infant in the nation to be placed on artificial life support to keep its organs healthy for transplant, hospital officials said. Doctors had planned to maintain the body for up to seven days, but a blood test Friday `` suggests that his liver is failing,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. One prospective candidate in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was not an appropriate match and another in the same hospital became infected, delaying any possible transplant, she said Friday. A medical center in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> also was unable to accept the liver for another candidate because they were committed to another transplant and could not do two in one day, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. `` The doctors in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> have refused the liver pending further studies,'' the spokeswoman said. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> turned down the liver because they feel it is not an ideal candidate for their recipient, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> was born with only a brain stem, a condition known as anencephaly that usually is fatal within days of birth. An infant's healthy organs can be transplanted only if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infant on life support from birth <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> is the nation's only medical center to experiment with using anencephalics as organ donors.

<HEAD>Pakistani Envoy Warns Of Afghan Bloodbath</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If Soviet troops withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before there is an interim coalition government in place, rival Afghan factions could become embroiled in unending civil strife, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister warned. `` In our opinion, the way things are being worked out by the Soviets, it is going to lead to a bloodbath,'' the diplomat, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Friday. He said hundreds of thousands of Afghans could be killed if a political settlement does not precede a Soviet departure, and called on the West to press <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for an agreement on an interim government. President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-Haq </PERSON>'s government in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> wants a transition government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, before it will sign an agreement leading to Soviet withdrawal and the return home of more than two million Afghan refugees now living in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said that without an interim coalition government, <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> believes the refugees will not return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We anticipate that under such circumstances more refugees will be coming into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, who met with Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> earlier Friday, denied <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was trying to sabotage the chances of an agreement at talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on how to end the conflict. He said <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> wants Soviet forces to leave, but also wants a lasting settlement. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said Afghan guerrilla leaders and refugee and emigre representatives on Monday would propose what he called a detailed framework of a coalition government. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to begin withdrawing the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> signs an accord at the next session of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that begin March 2. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said the Soviets would not attempt to influence the composition of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government after they leave. The Soviet leader said all Soviet forces could be withdrawn in 10 months if agreement is reached at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Soviets later accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of trying to block chances of an agreement. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s stand has some backing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but Western leaders have urged <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> not to go so far as to jeopardize <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s withdrawal pledge. Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and replaced one pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with another. The Soviet move was condemned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western governments. The Soviets and Afghan government soldiers have been fighting Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The guerrilla groups maintain bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and have received support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Friday following <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>: `` There is a tremendous amount of sympathy and concern for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. After eight years of occupation -LRB- in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -RRB-, the Soviet withdrawal is bound to leave a tremendous vacuum.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A published report today says two men closely linked with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> received $ 150,000 from a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> businessman pushing an Iraqi oil pipeline, but <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyer says the attorney general did n't benefit in any way The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> sent the money in mid-1985 to <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former investment adviser, and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for more than 30 years. Sources familiar with the payment said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said the money represents his legal fee for his work on the pipeline proposal, the newspaper said. That work included getting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s help in setting up a meeting for <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> in June 1985 with then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted one source as saying the money was `` sent to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> for the benefit of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said Friday he was aware of the payment but that `` it has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' `` None of it -LRB- the money -RRB- ever went to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' he said. `` None of it was ever used for the benefit of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the payment is not included on <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s 1985 income tax return and was not reported by him until May 1987, when independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> expanded his investigation of the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to include <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s dealings with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and a third man were accused in a federal indictment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December of taking illegal payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been conducting a separate investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s dealings with the two men. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in 1985 to try to drum up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the proposed 540-mile pipeline through <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> that would run close to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> territory. The pipeline never was built. The San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which was seeking to build the project, had enlisted the Swiss businessman's help because of his close ties to Israeli political figures.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Soviets Must `Face Up' To Human Rights Promblems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must `` face up'' to its human rights problems if it wants to participate in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> specifically cited restrictions on emigration and religious practices, as well as a lack of diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` So they have some work to do that will make their presence at an international conference more acceptable from our standpoint and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s standpoint,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters on his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is one of the topics on his agenda for the talks <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is to hold in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Sunday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and on Monday with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is scheduled to go to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next week to try to set up negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. He seemed doubtful that a peace conference would be the right framework. `` What is an international conference supposed to do if there is one?'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. But, he added, if the Soviets `` continue to advocate seriously an international conference they have to face up to these problems that are posed by their lack of diplomatic presence in one of the key parties, and the immigration and other problems that I mentioned.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would not seek Soviet backing for his efforts. `` We will talk around about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but we are not asking them for anything,'' he said. `` I think it will be more in the nature of information sharing.'' Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was nearly 800 people a month April through September of last year. It rose to over 900 monthly October through December. But in January, emigration dipped to about 650 to 700, and is at about the same rate this month. Last year, applications were accepted from Jews who did not have relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but on Jan. 1 the process was halted. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war, but sent a handful of diplomats to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the Soviets had imposed `` unwarranted'' restrictions on emigration and on the practice of Judaism and other religions. `` So they have some work to do,'' he said. On another front, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> backed <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s demand for a coalition government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said it would make `` a contribution'' to stability as Soviet troops withdrew from the country. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the U.S.-backed Afghan rebels would propose `` new ideas'' in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> when negotiations for a settlement resume March 2. The Soviets last week said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was obstructing an end to the eight-year war in the country by insisting that a change of government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> precede the signing of a peace agreement. Some 115,000 Soviet troops are in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> supporting the government in its war with the guerrillas. On Feb. 8 <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered to begin a withdrawal on May 15 if an agreement is reached, and to carry it out over 10 months. The negotiations are being conducted by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seized power in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in 1978, has presented its proposal for a future government to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who demanded anonymity, said it called for a dominant role for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would suspend its military aid to the rebels provided the Soviets `` cease similar supplies to the government forces.'' `` There has to be a symmetry there,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said.

 Republican <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> used a rare one-on-one confrontation with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to claim he is best qualified to continue `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution,'' while Democratic candidates debated bitterly despite a plea to tone down their family feud. Relishing the limelight relinquished by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who boycotted the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> debate Friday night in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> assailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stance on a nuclear missile defense and called the vice president's budget-balancing plan unworkable. The candidates in both parties kept up heavy-duty rhetorical fire as they sought to gain momentum going into upcoming primaries and caucuses, especially the Super Tuesday contests in 20 states on March 8. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was `` angry and bitter'' over his second-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the vice president's aides acknowledged that he was withdrawing from competition in Tuesday's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to devote more attention to the southern and border states holding contests on Super Tuesday, they said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, meanwhile, appearing in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said he was not shaken by his runner-up showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and that he will do well in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` We're ready for the next round in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and we'll see who wins those two. We'll see who's dispirited Wednesday morning next week,'' the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said. In their second caustic debate in as many days, three Democratic candidates played catch-the-leader in turning their criticism toward front-runners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew hoots from the crowd in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, when he asked <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> if he was `` proud of your vote for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tax cut in 1981.'' The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman defended his overall tax voting record. Most of that tax cut `` went to ordinary people,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> retorted: `` That was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the winner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary this week, took a direct shot at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s trade policies, warning during the Friday debate that `` we've got to do more than wave a fist at our foreign competitors.'' `` Why is everyone defending unfair trade practices?'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. Toward the end of a turbulent campaign week that saw the withdrawals of Republicans <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, there were these other developments: _ Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> that he would remain in the presidential race, despite saying just days earlier he would drop out if he did n't win in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s contests next Tuesday `` I'm in it until the finish line in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' he said, contending he had received an `` outpouring of encouragement'' and money since his disappointing third-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, holding a rally with supporters at the same posh <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> hotel where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his entourage had stayed, said he backed out of the debate because he did n't get enough tickets for his supporters, `` and I'd rather be with you here. Because of the no-shows by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> got a rare opportunity to confront <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with wide television exposure and without interference from others. He did n't flinch. `` I believe in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution and I want to carry it into the 1990s,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said in a point-blank challenge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oft-stated campaign pitch that he is the rightful heir to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy. In an exchange that provoked laughter, debate moderator <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> asked if the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appearance might suggest a GOP ticket for 1988. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> responded, `` I do n't think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to serve another eight years as vice president.'' In the night's sharpest exchange, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on nuclear weapons, saying he would more quickly research, test and develop a missile defense shield. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would be wrong to support `` premature development,'' and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> asserted that they must `` stand up for something'' beyond peace alone. `` I was in combat,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, referring to his record in World War II experience. `` I do n't think you know what it is until you've seen your fellow men drop dead.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> snapped back: `` I do n't need a lecture.'' The Democrats, during their St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> run-in </PERSON>, seemed oblivious to party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s exhortation that they cut down some of the internecine warfare. In a `` Dear Candidate'' letter, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said personal attacks among the contenders `` do nothing to enhance the opportunity for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November.'' But the candidates seemed unfazed by this. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> complained that `` my name was taken in vain'' by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who demanded to know why the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had not followed his example and released a budget proposal. `` The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because they do n't want to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the facts,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced a budget,'' retorted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 Agreement was reached Saturday on a $ 22 million package of union concessions that will keep the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> publishing and clears the way for owner <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to sell the paper. The agreement was reached at 1:50 a.m. after a final bargaining session that began around 10 a.m. Friday. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> had said the paper would close Friday unless the paper's unions provided concessions he needed to sell the money-losing paper to real estate developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> `` I want to say at this time that I wish Mr. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> great, successful publishing of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said in announcing the agreement. `` He's a very ambitious man, as well as being a wealthy one. I know that he is determined to make it successful,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said. `` He's getting the newspaper now in better shape, getting a newspaper with a fine staff, wonderful executives, and I'm sure that he needs nothing more than a new start under new leadership and he goes ahead with that with my full blessing.'' The agreement, slated to take effect March 7, is subject to the auditing of the savings by <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>'s company and fast ratification by each of the 10 unions involved, officials said. The cost reductions amount to $ 10 million in the first year, $ 8 million in the second and $ 6 million in the third, with a $ 2 million across-the-board bonus for employees in the third year, officials said. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> had demanded concessions totaling $ 24 million over three years to meet conditions of a deal to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for $ 37 million to <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>. According to the agreement, the paper will save $ 22.5 million by cutting 130 jobs, officials said. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> contributed $ 3 million to the package, raising the total beyond the $ 24 million mark and allowing for the employees' raises, officials said. Union leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for the $ 3 million `` to sweeten the pot.'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said the agreement resulted from good will on both sides. `` It has been a very difficult 12 days for all of us,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s offices, editors were preparing the Saturday edition. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> met earlier Friday with <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, said union leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. The alternative was to fold the paper because of a federal regulation barring <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> from owning a newspaper and TV station in the same city. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> owns <ORGANIZATION> WNYW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. On Friday morning, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> had declared flatly that he would not stop the clock to save the newspaper. On Wednesday, the unions put forward a proposal they said would save $ 33 million, $ 9 million more than <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> demanded, and asked that the extra money go into pay raises. On Thursday, management knocked down $ 12 million of the package as non-negotiable under terms of the deal with <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>. After 10 minutes with the negotiators at the Grand Hyatt Hotel on Friday morning, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said the gap in the concessions package amounted to $ 4 million over three years. The exact size of the gap was a major sticking point, along with the union demand for raises for those workers who survived the cuts. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said another problem was that management had increased the number of jobs that would have to be pared. Initially the negotiators said they were dealing with 116 reductions from a workforce of 1,200. While other union leaders went into small working groups to seek a solution, the leader of the paper's drivers' union, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, said he was done talking unless he heard from management. If the Post went under, he said, `` it died at the hands of Mr. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>.'' The union leaders consistently called on <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> to join the talks, but he said the concessions had to be made with <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for the sale to go through. The contract with <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> until Feb. 22 to negotiate the union concessions. The Post, founded in 1801 by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, faced financial problems from its earliest years but held on as paper after paper in the city merged and then eventually shut down. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> bought the afternoon tabloid from <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> in 1976 for about $ 31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, the paper turned from liberal to conservative on the editorial page and became splashy and racy. The early edition of Friday carried the front-page headline: `` Only Hours to Live ...'' to promote a story about the release of photographs taken of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> a short time before she was killed in Central Park. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> says he has lost nearly $ 150 million in 11 years of operating the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He said Friday that current losses were running $ 100,000 a day. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> chose to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> following a congressional rider engineered by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, that blocked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from continuing to waive its rule barring ownership of both a television station and a newspaper in the same city <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> owns <ORGANIZATION> WNYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he faces the same situation, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has indicated he'd sell his TV station and hold on to the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>.

 A commuter plane crashed in heavy fog Friday night after takeoff from <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and all 12 people aboard were feared dead, officials said. American Eagle Flight 378 was en route to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with 10 passengers and two crew members when it went down in a wooded area at 9:27 p.m. about a mile from the 10,000-foot runway, said airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Damiano </PERSON>. `` I show them as fatal,'' said V.H. <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, night duty officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Witnesses said they heard an explosion and saw a fireball before the twin-engine plane with a seating capacity of 19 went down near a small residential area, Ms. <PERSON> Damiano </PERSON> said. She said no homes were hit. `` There are no anticipated survivors,'' she said. `` Indications are that the plane is in several pieces. There was a small bit of fire that was contained. There was no indication to the tower that the plane was in any danger prior to takeoff.'' Shortly after midnight, a woman was escorted into the terminal sobbing and asking, `` What happened?'' The woman, who declined to give her name, said her 13-year-old son was on the flight. She said she had received no official word on her son's fate. `` It sounded like a blast or something because they've been blasting down on this road, putting in sewer lines, and that's the way it sounded,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who lives in a mobile home three miles from the airport. `` It was n't too awful loud. It was kind of muffled. I wondered what it was, but there was nobody here but me so I did n't go out and look around.'' At <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, several people were waiting for information on the crash and on arrangements for travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said a ground supervisor for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> who refused to give his name. `` They ca n't believe it happened,'' said the man. `` Some people wish it was them.'' Most of the passengers were from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, and the crew was based in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, he said. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will arrive Saturday, <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, had recently resumed flights from its base at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> after filing for bankruptcy reorganization Jan. 15. The airline abruptly ceased flights Jan. 14, leaving some passengers stranded. In its bankruptcy filing, <ORGANIZATION> AVAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, claimed $ 9.2 million in assets and $ 12 million in liabilities.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent records to help <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> investigate alleged links between <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and six <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> commandos who were executed in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. She also said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had no suspicions about <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s record as an intelligence officer in the German army when he was elected <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general in 1972. The prime minister made the comments Friday in written replies to questions in the House of Commons. Allegations have been made that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who held the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> job 10 years and now is president of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, committed war crimes during his service in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. An international panel of historians appointed by the Austrian government said it found no proof, but left the question of guilt open. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, 69, has denied wrongdoing since the accusations began during his presidential campaign two years ago, and has refused to resign since the historians' report was made public last week. The arrival of the microfilmed German army war records from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military archives was the latest step in an attempt ordered by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to determine whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> interrogated the six commandos. The men, a raiding party captured off the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Alimina </LOCATION> in April 1944, were handed over for interrogation to the unit in which <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> served. They refused to talk and were executed by the Germans, a war crime under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention on prisoners of war. `` I am informed that at the time of Dr. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s election as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general no doubts were raised about his wartime record,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. She was answering questions from lawmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who served on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s personal staff at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and now is trying to prove him guilty of war crimes. The historians' report said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was in `` close proximity'' to atrocities, must have known of them and did nothing to stop them British officials said the material sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was a copy of the so-called <PERSON> Alimina </PERSON> file dealing with the capture of the commandos. The original file was in a mass of German military documents American forces captured at the end of the war in 1945. The documents were kept in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until sent to West German archives at <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION> in the late 1960s. Historian <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> says records of the vital second interrogation of the commandos, including who conducted it, were missing from the original file in <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> was the British member of the international commission, which reported finding the initial `` W'' in <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s hand on an earlier record of interviews with the six men, indicating he at least had read it. The historians' report said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was well aware of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s orders to execute commandos A note in English attached to the Alimina file said: `` Do not film this sheet. Interrogations reports removed because of security classification.'' It was not immediately clear whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> microfilmed material was more complete than the original file. An inquiry in 1986, based on incomplete British files, did not establish a link between <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and the commandos.

<HEAD>Four Die In Fire, Bringing Fume Death Toll To 14 This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four men died today from inhaling toxic fumes given off when plastic foam in a sofa caught fire during a minor blaze at an apartment, <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> reported. The four deaths bring to at least 14 the number of Britons killed during fires by the thick black fumes given off by plastic foam used as filling material in cheap furniture. The other 10 victims were children who died within the first 10 days of this year. Public concern and a long-running campaign by fire chiefs against the filling prompted the government to announce last month a ban on use of standard and high-resilience polyurethane foam in new furniture. The ban would be put into effect starting February 1989. The time gap is to allow manufacturers to re-equip but the ban does not cover existing foam-filled furniture, which will remain a potential danger in many homes. The fire brigade said in a statement that a carelessly discarded cigarette is thought to have started today's fire in an apartment at <LOCATION> Bethnal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The fire itself took firefighters only 10 minutes to bring under control. They found the bodies of two of the dead beside a locked rear door in the apartment. The bodies of the other two victims were found in a bathroom. They are thought to have taken refuge there to escape the fumes. A fifth man, found in the same room as the sofa, also had inhaled the fumes but survived. He was hospitalized.

<TEXT>
 TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who accused ousted <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> of sexual misconduct, is being investigated by the Assemblies of God church amid reports of similar allegations. The denomination's 13-member Executive Presbytery met with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> at its headquarters here for nearly 10 hours Thursday `` to discuss matters that could affect his credentials with the church,'' church spokeswoman <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> would not give details of the investigation, but said it is a `` critical situation'' and that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is cooperating. The Assemblies of God last year stripped <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> of his credentials. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline,'' citing sources it did not identify, reported early today that church officials at the meeting were shown photographs purported to show <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and a known prostitute going into and out of a motel room. One unidentified church official told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> the photos were open to interpretation. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not deny to church officials that he had been with a prostitute, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> preacher <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> was believed to have provided the photos to church officials. The Assemblies of God defrocked <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> in 1986 for `` immorality and conduct unbecoming to a minister,'' an unidentified church official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the probe involved allegations of sexual misconduct, and the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources in today's editions as saying the investigation involved charges of adultery. The Assemblies of God did not comment on the nature of its investigation. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said late Friday: `` At this point, we do n't have a statement.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was stripped of his credentials as a minister in the church following allegations of homosexuality and an extramarital sexual encounter in 1980 with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, said Friday night that the reports about <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> were `` most confusing and hurtful.'' `` I'm shocked,'' he added. `` What we've gone through no one on earth should have to go through.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, 52, is president of a TV ministry worth an estimated $ 140 million a year. It is based in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and broadcasts to 143 countries. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, interviewed at the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> airport upon his return from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, was asked about the nature of the meeting with church officials. `` You'll have to call them and ask them,'' he replied. When asked about the report of the pictures, he said, `` Call our attorney if you like.'' Last September, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> filed a $ 90 million suit accusing <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and others of plotting to ruin his TV ministry with false reports of adulterous affairs. A judge dismissed the suit, saying it was a religious dispute that did n't belong in court. Shortly afterward, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s organization, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> Ministries, filed for bankruptcy reorganization, claiming debts of more than $ 2 million. He is pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Calls to <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s church in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> went unanswered, and there is no telephone listing under <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>'s name there. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a Pentecostal minister, has come under scrutiny recently on several fronts. In June, a court battle over the tax-exempt status of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> radio station belonging to the ministry forced the evangelical empire to release details of its finances and led to allegations <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has kept contributions for his personal use. When <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> last March, he accused a rival group of trying to take over the $ 172 million TV ministry by exposing his involvement in a sex-and-money scandal. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was alleged to be a member of that rival group, but denied that accusation. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> later retracted the charge. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a high-school dropout, is the cousin of singer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, have a son, <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON>. In addition to the television ministry, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has put out more than 50 gospel albums and runs one of the largest non-profit mail order merchandise businesses in the country.

 Thai and Laotian officers today flew over a disputed border area to arrange for the disengagement of troops that had been locked in a bloody, 3 -LCB- - month battle, a Thai officer said Since a truce began Friday, no fighting was reported in the area where hundreds of soldiers on both sides had died since fighting commenced in November around contested hills at the frontier.

 Friends of a teen-ager accused of hacking four family members to death with an ax tried to hand him letters of support during his arraignment as people here struggled for an explanation of the slayings. `` It would be so much easier for us if we could say the guy was living on the edge, a criminal at heart,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said Friday. `` But no, he's a very regular kid. The allegations are beyond our comprehension.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, a 16-year-old <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> sophomore, was captured here Friday and charged in the Thursday slayings of his parents and younger brother and sister. <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> gave himself a punk haircut on the day of the killings, said Olmsted County Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>. Killed were <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, 41, an engineer at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> plant; <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, 14; and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, 9, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said. The four were found in their night clothes in the family's home in a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> suburb, all apparently struck at least once with an ax, the sheriff said. A bloody, 28-inch ax was found in the basement, the sheriff said. During Brom's arraignment Friday, about a dozen friends tried to hand him letters of support, but were stopped by security guards. Friends and acquaintances wrote several dozen letters to be delivered to him in the <LOCATION> Olmsted </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, a city of about 60,000 some 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` We want him to know we support him and care about him,'' said one classmate, who would not give her name. `` Anybody who judges <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> without knowing him is out of their mind,'' said student <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromelkamp </PERSON>. `` He may have done something bad, but there's a lot of people he touched. In the morning, I would come in in a bad mood, and there's <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> with a big smile and a joke.'' Some students told reporters that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> had recently argued with his father over a punk rock music tape the son brought home, and said the teen-ager liked punk groups such as Suicidal Tendencies. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> dyed and cut his hair in a spiked, punk fashion Thursday, and that he had bought a wig and makeup in what the sheriff speculated may have been an attempt to disguise himself. `` He listened to some pretty far-out music, but he was n't a satanist and was n't a transvestite'' or a drug-user, <PERSON> Bromelkamp </PERSON> said. Brom appeared calm Friday during his 15-minute arraignment on four counts of first-degree murder and eight counts of second-degree murder. The charges allege different degrees of premeditation or intent. According to the complaint, one unidentified person indicated that Brom on Wednesday said he was going to kill his parents that night, and another person indicated that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> told her over the phone the next day that he had killed his parents. District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Brom </ORGANIZATION> examined by court-appointed psychiatrists, said County Attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>. He was being held under a 24-hour watch at the county jail pending a detention hearing next week, <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said. Assistant county public defender <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, representing Brom, said he will fight any efforts to have the youth tried as an adult. The administration of the 415-student <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school set up a series of therapy sessions and a special Mass on Friday. Dozens of students spent much of the day hugging, crying and talking to friends and counselors. A funeral is planned Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Pax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where the elder <PERSON> Broms </PERSON> were known as leaders and devout Christians.

 Sikh gunmen killed two people at a bus stop outside <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> today, raising to 25 the number of people slain in two days of bombings and shootings in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, police and news reports said. The victims included 10 people shot to death then set ablaze in a farmhouse and 10 others who died in apparently well-planned bomb attacks in four cities in the northern state. More than 60 people were wounded in the bombings. An unexploded bomb was found today in a fifth city, <LOCATION> Batala </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the four-pound tin of explosives was left in a store by a woman customer in the city 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The news agency also said two men were shot to death this afternoon at a bus stop on the edge of the Sikh holy city. The latest killings brought to nearly 250 the number of people killed this year in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> in attacks blamed on Sikh militants, who demand a separate nation for their minority religion. In the village of <LOCATION> Sahsra </LOCATION>, nine members of a farm family were killed with automatic rifles and revolvers Friday night, along with a man staying at the house, police said. Residents in the village 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> said about six Sikh gunmen stormed into the home of farmer <PERSON> Kewal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> while the family slept. The assailants set the bodies, the farmouse and its furnishings ablaze, the villagers said. The victims included the farmer, his wife, two daughters, four sons, a niece and a guest identified as <PERSON> Sukhdev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Police said earlier reports that 11 died apparently resulted from confusion. While Sikh militants frequently claim their Sikh victims are police informers, neighbors insisted <PERSON> Kewal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was only a simple villager. <PERSON> Gurcharan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the village leader, said he was `` a poor farmer and tongawalla,'' or wagon driver. UNI reported two other people were shot to death by Sikh militants Friday at <LOCATION> Bhuri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kalan </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> and a man was killed near <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION>, about 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Friday's bomb attacks were in the cities of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hoshiarpur </LOCATION> and prompted police in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to issue a `` red alert'' that the attacks might spread to the capital. Sikh extremists have been fighting for a separate state in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. Sikhs are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> but comprise only 2 percent of the nationwide population of 780 million, more than 80 percent of whom are <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION>. The Sikh faith has elements of both <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam and was founded about 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to the two warring religions. But the Sikhs' 10th and final prophet, Guru <PERSON> Gobind </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, declared <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> a warrior faith in which male adherents should all carry knives and bear the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, `` lion'' in <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION>.

 Witnesses report seeing a fireball and hearing an explosion before a commuter plane crashed on takeoff from <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing all 12 people aboard in one of three air tragedies. Near <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, at least six people were killed in a plane crash Friday, authorities said, and three others died when a plane slammed into a highway in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> commuter flight 3378, a twin-engine turboprop bound for <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, crashed in heavy fog at 9:27 p.m. Friday with 10 passengers and two crew members aboard, airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Damiano </PERSON> said. `` The plane is in several pieces,'' Ms. <PERSON> Damiano </PERSON> said. `` There was a small bit of fire that was contained. There was no indication to the tower that the plane was in any danger prior to takeoff.'' She said witnesses reported hearing an explosion and seeing a fireball before the crash. `` It sounded like a blast or something,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who lives in a mobile home about three miles from the airport. `` It was kind of muffled.'' A team of investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> flew to the scene, said V.H. <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, night duty officer for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, The airplane was listed as a Swearingen SW-4 twin-engine turboprop, <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> said. The fog was not believed to be a factor in the crash, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wines </PERSON>, the airport tower controller. The victims' names were not immediately available. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> is a commuter carrier for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, no one survived when a small twin-engine plane crashed in dense fog and driving rain near <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, officials said. Emergency crews were still on the scene early today, and few details of the crash were available. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said at least six people died when the twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> went down sometime after 10:10 p.m., when its radar signal was lost, but it was not known exactly how many were aboard. Deep woods, fog and rain hampered investigative work, <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport at <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said. It was found at 11:11 p.m. about two miles northwest of the airport. <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said officials from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> would be at the scene today. He said the 32-foot-long plane is of the type commonly used by commuter airlines, but that it mave have been privately owned. Earlier, a twin-engine plane skimmed over morning rush-hour traffic and crashed on a freeway access road in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, killing all three people aboard and spewing flaming debris that destroyed two parked cars, authorities said. `` It looked like it was going to attempt maybe to come onto the freeway, but as soon as it got over the freeway, it just nosedived,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Armendariz </PERSON>, who was at a stop light. The Gulfstream Commander 680 went down in moderate snow and light fog after takeoff from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said. The plane apparently developed landing-gear trouble and was trying to return, <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said. The victims' identities were not immediately released and the plane's destination was not available. In <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, authorities attempted Friday to free a downed plane from 10 feet of mud in a lake but failed when a helicopter pulled the tail off as it tried to lift the wreckage. The plane was buried nose down in the shallow waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prien </LOCATION>, where it went down Thursday. Officials said the wreckage was buried so deep that there was no way to determine fatalities, but it was believed two men were aboard.

 A militia commander today said his forces arrested several accomplices in the kidnapping of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer who heads a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer team, but that the mastermind had escaped. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, the top military commander of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, also that the kidnapping was well-planned in advance but that a series of snags slowed down the abductors' flight, giving <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> time to seal the area. He said he believes Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> still is in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, although he was kidnapped Wednesday. `` We have arrested several accomplices, but the leader of the kidnap operation has left the south,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at his home in <LOCATION> Bedias </LOCATION>, seven miles northeast of Tyre. `` We know them all by name now, and we believe -LRB- Lt. -RRB- Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is still in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said. Amal militiamen and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops have sealed off a 300-square-mile area around Tyre, searching through cave-strewn valleys and olive and citrus groves. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, heads a 76-man unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer team that monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice agreement between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The group is attached to the 5,800-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, deployed in 1978 after an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> incursion into south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Friday claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction, accusing him of being a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy. American and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the charge. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, had been a junior military aide to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> but that his abduction did not pose a major security risk to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The first claim of responsibility for the kidnapping came Thursday in a call from an anonymous man claiming to speak for a previously unknown group, the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades. `` We believe <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is still in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because the accomplice who was assigned to transport him to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after the abduction is detained by us,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said, refusing to identify any of the suspects or their affiliations. Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many of the 40 men detained have links to the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, an umbrella organization for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> radio station, based in <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>, in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, claimed today that 150 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> members were rounded up in house raids in the Tyre region. `` Amal's men have stormed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s operations center in the south, seized documents, equipment and cameras. They also raided the house of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>,'' the radio said. It made no mention of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction was `` carefully thought out, planned and staged.'' He said among the detainees were those assigned to monitor <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' movements, and `` they have confessed that they knew four days in advance that he was coming to Tyre on Wednesday.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was driving from Tyre to <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> when gunmen in a brown <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> car blocked the highway and seized him. `` The kidnappers ran into a chain of snags after the abduction. Their first car, the brown <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, got stuck in the mud. They made a bulldozer driver push them out, but the exhaust was broken and they had to move <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> to a white <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said. `` This -LRB- second -RRB- car collided with a truck loaded with oranges southeast of Tyre. The kidnappers then moved <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> to a red Mercedes and fled to their unknown hideout,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> added. `` These snags cost the kidnappers about 1 -LCB- hours, during which we managed to seal off all exits from Tyre region south of the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said. He said the mastermind had sent four other brown <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> cars speeding through several neighboring villages. `` He wanted to shake off any pursuers. However, the accidents gave us the needed time to seal off the area,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said. `` I am 60 percent certain that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is still south of the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION>. It is very difficult for them to smuggle him out on foot through the valleys. Nevertheless, we're keeping this in mind,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> today said: `` We are maintaining road checks and heavy emphasis on collection of information. We believe he is probably still south of the <LOCATION> Litani </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not withdraw Americans from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group, despite the abduction. Fifteen other nations contribute to the unit. In its type-written Arabic statement, the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is `` one of the biggest spies planting daily terror in our land.'' The statement was delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, accompanied by photocopies of two identity cards of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The group, believed made up of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots, previously has claimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings and the abduction of 12 Lebanese Jews. It has claimed to have killed eight of the Jews kidnapped in 1984.

 The Soviets' top arms control official said his country is counting on Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to arrive ready to explore new initiatives in U.S.-Soviet disarmament talks. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, a former arms negotiator who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s arms control department, said late Friday that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit, which begins Sunday, `` must set the pace for further Soviet-U. dialogue.'' During the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official's three-day visit, he is scheduled to talk with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top Soviet officials about a proposed agreement to cut the superpowers' long-range nuclear missiles by 50 percent. The talks follow the Dec. 8 signing of a treaty to ban superpower medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> In a special panel of the Supreme Soviet parliament earlier Friday, two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said that ratification of the Dec. 8 treaty could save the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> more than $ 80 million and would free `` tens of thousands'' of soldiers from their present duties. Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the military chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> were among top officials who spoke before the panel, which is considering ratification of the pact. Those who spoke at the hearing at the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the treaty, but <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said the Soviet military is worried about <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> moves to compensate for the weapons slated for destruction by the pact. `` The idea of compensation is wild,'' said the first deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. `` A doctor who operates on a person to cure him of an ulcer does not then say, ` What can I put in to compensate for the ulcer?''' On Feb. 9, the foreign relations commissions of the two houses of the Soviet legislature created a special 10-member subcommittee to seek the opinion of experts and ordinary Soviet citizens about the treaty. The treaty must be ratified by the Supreme Soviet's Presidium to become law. But because it already has been approved by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, passage is assured. Friday's two-hour hearing seemed designed to assuage the fears of some Soviets that their leaders made too many concessions in the treaty. A small group of foreign reporters was allowed to attend. `` Those against are few,'' said chairman <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korniyenko </PERSON>, summing up Soviet public opinion. `` Those who are against just do n't trust the imperialists ... but then there are not a few who have concerns.'' Under the pact, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must destroy 1,752 missiles, compared with 859 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said that under the agreement, the Soviets will eliminate 650 modern medium-range missiles, while the Americans will destroy 689 new weapons, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> needs to modernize its battlefield nuclear weapons or improve its conventional arms to make up for the banned missiles. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said there was `` not a word'' in the INF treaty that would bar such measures. <PERSON> Akromeyev </PERSON> said 3 percent to 4 percent of the `` tens of thousands'' of military men to be released from their duty with the missiles would be put on pension, but that younger men could continue with their military careers. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told the panel that missiles and other Soviet military equipment worth $ 33 million to $ 41.5 million would be destroyed because of the treaty. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would save $ 83 million, and that military equipment used for the missiles that does not have to be destroyed is worth $ 250 million. The subcommittee adjourned without a date set for its next session. The panel will report back to the <LOCATION> Supreme </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION>'s foreign relations commissions, which must recommend whether the treaty should be ratified.

 A strong earthquake rattled across central and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> early today, causing minor damage in this agricultural town and shaking people awake over a wide area, officials said. No injuries were reported. The quake measured 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, spokesman for the seismology laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> Hollister </LOCATION>, the tremor knocked products off store shelves, broke a glass door and set off burglar alarms across the city, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, emergency services coordinator for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

 The air force carried out a revenge attack on two <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> this morning, retaliating for a bank bombing that killed 18 people in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the defense force chief said. Gen. <PERSON> Jannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said air force fighter aircraft successfully carried out attacks on South-West African People's Organization targets in <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION> and Ongiva in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> He said the attacks were in retaliation Friday's bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where 18 people were killed and 31 injured. <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting for 22 years against South African occupation of the territory, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, was responsible for the lunch-hour bomb. A statement Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, denied involvement in the bombing, and said it was part of a South African propaganda campaign to `` smear the name of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The guerrillas fight in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, from bases in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that periodically are raided by the South African <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Eight Mirage fighters took part in the attack on two targets near <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION>, 186 miles north of the Namibian-Angolan border; and five <ORGANIZATION> Impala </ORGANIZATION> aircraft attacked targets at <LOCATION> Ongiva </LOCATION>, 26 miles north of the border, the statement said. <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION> targets were `` <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s most important training center in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hainyeko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and a terrorist holding area about 10 kms -LRB- 6.2 miles -RRB- west of there.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas receive training in the handling of explosives at the <ORGANIZATION> Tobias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hainyeko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which he said, `` can be regarded as the breeding ground for terrorism against the inhabitants of South-West Africa-Namibia.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had launched a number of raids from Ongiva recently on civilians in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the general said. `` By these attacks the security forces demonstrated their willingness never to allow <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> terrorism to go unpunished,'' <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said. `` Terrorists will be tracked down and destroyed.'' Friday's bank blast was the deadliest in 22 years of war between the black guerrillas and the minority white government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Among the dead in the blast in the far-northern town of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> were 10 women, three men and a child. All the victims were black, except for one white woman who was identified today in a pro-government newspaper as the wife of a member of a special police unit. Four of the bodies were discovered in the rubble Friday night, said The Citizen newspaper. Of the 31 people injured, 20 of them were black, said an army spokesman, <PERSON> Cmdt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lieb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bester </PERSON>. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which destroyed the bank building. Five people were injured when an explosion occurred in the street near the same bank a year ago. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> to visit the scene Friday afternoon. He called the bombing `` a barbarous and senseless attack on the community of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, achieving nothing.'' All those killed were civilians, <PERSON> Bester </PERSON> said. Most were believed to be local government employees who had just been paid. A police inspector, Keirie Du Rand, said about 55 pounds of plastic explosive was used in the blast, which occurred shortly before 1 p.m. He said a fire raged for several hours after the explosion, hampering police access to the scene. <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> is in north-central <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, about 25 miles south of the Angolan border. It is home to the largest military base in the region, a staging point for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s current military intervention in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for numerous previous bombings in the territory, including a blast last month at a store at a military base in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest continuously published daily, gained a new lease on life today with approval by its unions of $ 22 million in concessions. Owner <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> had said unless he was given $ 24 million in concessions he would close the paper. But he contributed $ 3 million to the deal, calling it a farewell gift. The agreement clears the way for <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> to complete a $ 37 million sale of the financially troubled tabloid, founded in 1801 by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, to real estate developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>. The agreement was reached at 1:50 a.m. after nearly 16 hours of bargaining. `` I want to say at this time that I wish Mr. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> great, successful publishing of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said in announcing the agreement. `` I ... hate to leave it.'' While <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> had said the paper would close unless he obtained the concessions, he agreed to stop the clock as negotiations continued past his 2 p.m. Friday deadline. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> agreed to a package that would save $ 2 million less than originally sought on condition the unions agreed to all other terms, according to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for both <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> would save $ 10 million in the first year, $ 8 million in the second and $ 6 million in the third, minus a $ 2 million bonus in the final year, said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON>, an adviser to the unions. In each of the three years, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> saves $ 7.5 million through employee buyouts and $ 2.5 million through employee pay cuts, <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON> said. In all, 130 jobs from a work force of 1,200 will be eliminated. However, in the first year employees will not lose anything because <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> will give them $ 2.5 million to restore the pay cuts, he added. In the second year, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> is to restore $ 2 million of the pay cuts and <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> make up the difference with $ 500,000. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> agreed to provide $ 4 million in raises and $ 2 million in bonuses in the third year, <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's any question that without <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s contribution of $ 3 million, the paper would have definitely shut down,'' <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> referred to the $ 3 million contribution as a farewell gift. Union leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for the $ 3 million. The unions achieved their goal `` to save our jobs for our people and our families,'' said <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for Post unions. The agreement, to take effect March 7, is subject to verification by <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>'s auditors and union ratification, but <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said those were only formalities. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>: `` He's a very ambitious man, as well as being a wealthy one. I know that he is determined to make it -LRB- the newspaper -RRB- successful.'' The Post faced financial problems from its earliest years but held on as paper after paper in the city merged, then shut down. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> bought the afternoon tabloid, the nation's oldest continuously published daily, from <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> in 1976 for about $ 31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, the paper turned from liberal to conservative on the editorial page, became splashy and at times racy. His efforts failed to turn the paper around. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> says he has lost nearly $ 150 million in 11 years of operating the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He said Friday that current losses were running $ 100,000 a day. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> announced he had reached agreement to sell the Post to <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>. The sale was prompted by congressional action late last year that blocked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from granting him another waiver to its rule against owning a newspaper and TV station in the same market. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> also owns WNYW-TV in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he faces the same situation, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has indicated he'd sell his TV station and hold on to the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>.

 One person was killed and 14 people were taken to a hospital after a fire broke out today in two cars of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train near here, authorities said. The fire aboard the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Zephyr was reported around 3 a.m. and was under control by 4:30 a.m., said Fire Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitera </PERSON>.

 Soldiers shot and killed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrator today in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> during a march on the municipal building, the Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and hospital sources said. A spokesman for the Israeli army could not immediately confirm the death. The Palestinian news agency identified the victim as <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Atta </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, 20, and said he was shot in the head. It said <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> was one of several hundred demonstrators demanding the resignation of the municipal council of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, which is 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Sources at a hospital at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> was shot in the forehead. The army command said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops clashed with 200 Moslem worshipers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Moslems and Jews both believe the site is the burial place of the biblical patriarchs <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and three of their four wives. Arabs spread prayer rugs on the floor and began to pray Friday during Jewish services in a chamber normally used at different hours as a place of worship by Jews and Arabs. The site attracts Jewish and Moslem religious fundamentalists and has been a constant source of friction since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. An army spokeswoman said soldiers ordered the Moslem worshipers out of the hall and used force, but not gunfire or tear gas, to evict them when they refused. The Arabs attacked the soldiers, the spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity in keeping with army regulations. By <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> count and not including today's reported death, 55 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since protests began in the occupied territories Dec. 8. In other developments on Friday: _ <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers tangled with Palestinian protesters in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, but no casualties were reported _ Military sources denied charges by <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops were using dumdum bullets against Arab protesters Dumdum bullets expand explosively when they hit a target, causing greater damage. _ <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON>, one of six Palestinians reportedly favored to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next week, said he would cancel the meeting if ordered to do so by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, hundreds of protesters waved <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, brandished photographs of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and chanted slogans. They moved toward <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops at the exits of the old city, throwing stones, bricks and bottles. Soldiers retaliated with tear gas and chased youths through the streets. At <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hundreds of people demonstrated after prayers, carrying <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and throwing rocks. The army command denied Palestinian reports that soldiers used tear gas and clubs to disperse the protesters at <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, protesters threw stones and burned tires. Shati refugee camp remained under curfew imposed by the army last week. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a visit, made the charge about dumdum bullets at a news conference Friday. He said he saw X-rays of a wound which `` showed shattering of the bone and flesh consistent with the use of an explosive bullet.'' At another point he said the injury was consistent with `` the wound inflicted by a dumdum bullet.'' The comment by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> came after the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Friday. The statement said the visit, and a new peace initiative promoted by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, were aimed `` at liquidating the Palestinian cause and the heroic uprising'' in the occupied lands. It said no Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories would meet <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on his visit. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON> said: `` I must obey the -LRB- PLO -RRB- request, whatever it is.'' Earlier, he said he would urge <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` to agree to the convening of an international peace conference and help the parties reach a settlement between themselves.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> backs an international peace conference if it includes an independent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two main parties, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and centrist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are split over the convening of a peace conference but united in their refusal to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Saturday that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> received no money or benefit from a reported $ 150,000 payment to two close <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> associates in connection with promotion of an Iraqi pipeline project. The attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said he was aware of the payment but that `` it has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' Swiss businessman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> sent the money in mid-1985 to <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former investment adviser, and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for more than 30 years, according to sources familiar with independent prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> was enlisted by the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which was seeking to build the project. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> as saying the money from <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> represented his legal fee for his work on the pipeline proposal, including getting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s help to set up a meeting for <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> in June 1985 with then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> characterized as `` not a big deal'' the fact that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had been paid a fee through <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> and that the $ 150,000 had been deposited in a trust account with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> never got any money from the pipeline project or from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. He never got any money from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> with the exception of a few lunches,'' said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>. The lawyer said that the only money <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> got through his partnership with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was the previously disclosed stock profits that <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> earned for the attorney general through various stock trades. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the payment was not included on <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s 1985 income tax return and was not reported by him until May 1987, when <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> expanded his investigation of the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to include <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s dealings with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>. A federal indictment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and a third man of taking illegal payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in 1985 to try to drum up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the proposed 540-mile pipeline through <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> that would run close to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> territory. The pipeline never was built.

<HEAD>Reagan Urges Congress To Forget Election-Year Spending Pressure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ward off election year pressure for increased spending and enact the $ 1.1 trillion budget presented earlier in the week. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> upholds its commitments and stands firm against pressures for increased spending _ pressures that reach a peak during election years _ solid results will be forthcoming,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio speech. `` If our proposed budget is enacted, deficit spending will have dropped from $ 221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to $ 130 billion in fiscal year 1989,'' the president said. He said consultations between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House before the budget submission _ which both branches have hailed as a method of avoiding budget fights as in previous years _ demonstrates `` responsible leadership expected by the electorate.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the budget will `` keep the lid'' on spending, while recognizing that some increases are needed to avoid jeopardizing national security. He repeated his criticism of last year's budget process, saying late amendments to the spending bill required him to sign a package without the review it should have been granted, or face shutdown of the federal government. With the new budget, he said, `` we have an opportunity to put our fiscal house in order.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also repeated his assertion that his administration has presided over the biggest economic expansion since World War II and once again hailed his administration's record on employment.

<TEXT>
 Police across the country detained at least seven top opposition activists in an apparent effort to prevent a weekend Solidarity meeting from convening, opposition spokesmen said today. Among those reported held were two prominent figures in the outlawed trade union federation who were removed by officers from a car also carrying Solidarity Chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, interviewed by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said union spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> regional Solidarity leader <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON> were taken from his car shortly after noon, but he was left alone. `` We have reforms by -LRB- means of -RRB- arresting,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said sarcastically. `` This is something well known to communist authorities.'' Also reported held was <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, Warsaw-region Solidarity leader who was the union's underground chief after the imposition of martial law in December 1981. He was detained at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> train station before he could board a train to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to attend a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> initially reported that Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> was detained at the same time. But <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> opposition spokesmen said later that <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> was mistaken and <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> had not been held. Solidarity regional leaders from <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wroclaw </PERSON> also were reported detained. Commission meetings are not announced in advance, and neither <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> would not state the reason for the meeting in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port. However Solidarity, which has remained active despite its being banned in 1982, is known to be evaluating its strategy in the face of steep price increases imposed Feb. 1. The increases have caused widespread discontent, but no major unrest. Past price increases have triggered violence as well as the strikes that spawned Solidarity in August 1980. <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, who spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said 19 people were detained nationwide, but there were contradictory reports from other opposition sources. A spokesman in the government press office, <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustynowicz </PERSON>, said he had no immediate comment on the reports but would look into them. Authorities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> often use brief detentions to block illegal meetings. Since a 1986 amnesty, no one has been held more than 48 hours solely on political charges. <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, a regional leader of Solidarity in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, was detained Friday evening by a group of uniformed and plainclothes police, said his wife, <PERSON> Krystyna </PERSON>. Police later telephoned their home and said without explanation that <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON> was being held for 48 hours, she said. It was not known if <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, who is also a member of Solidarity's executive commission, had planned to attend the meeting in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. However, he was to attend a meeting Sunday of a banned farmers' group, <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Another executive commission member, <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Weglarz </PERSON>, was detained Friday in his home city of <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said opposition spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Winiarski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurczak </PERSON>, an executive commission member from near <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, also was detained Friday, another opposition source said. Briefly detained was <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepniak </PERSON>, from near <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION>, a leader of Rural Solidarity, said <PERSON> Winiarski </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Stepniak </PERSON> was warned against attending the Rural Solidarity meeting in <LOCATION> Rzeszow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Provisional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION>, an farmers' union modeled on the Soviet bloc's first and only independent labor federation, has called a national meeting of farmers to mark the seventh anniversary of the 1981 Rzeszow-Ustrzyki agreements. In those accords, the government officially recognized Rural Solidarity. After the imposition of martial law, Rural Solidarity was banned, although some members have continued their activities.

 A regional ice cream company has won a trademark victory over giant <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed a frozen milkshake called `` Quick Thaw McStraw'' was too much like its own trademarks. `` It's not often that the little guy wins over a Fortune 500 company,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roney </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Oberweis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Roney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roney </PERSON> announced Friday that it has won a five-year trademark dispute with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> The Roney company, which makes ice cream and ice milk in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, filed in December 1983 for a trademark registration for `` Quick Thaw McStraw.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio broadcast: My fellow Americans, this week I transmitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> our proposed budget for 1989. This budget fulfills the second year obligations of a bipartisan agreement I hammered out last November with the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We then, after arduous negotiations, agreed on a plan to reduce federal deficit spending by over $ 75 billion in two years. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> upholds its commitments and stands firm against pressures for increased spending _ pressures that reached a peak during election years _ solid results will be forthcoming, and progress has already been made. If our proposed budget is enacted, deficit spending will have dropped from $ 221 billion in Fiscal Year 1986 to $ 130 billion in Fiscal Year 1989. As a proportion of gross national product, it will have been cut by more than half since 1983. The legislative and executive branches, by living up to our commitments of last November, are demonstrating the kind of responsible leadership expected by the electorate. The budget we've transmitted is true to that spirit It reduces the level of deficit spending, while at the same time, holds the line against any general tax increase. It remains firm in our commitments to essential domestic programs. It also includes funding for the minimum defense program needed to keep our country safe and necessary to honor our commitments to our friends and allies. Anything less would not only jeopardize our national security, but also dim prospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries. We've proposed a trim budget that keeps the lid on spending, and yet still recognizes that some increases are justified. For example, we're actually calling for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to spend substantially more on education, combating AIDS, the war against drugs, and improving air safety, while keeping discretionary domestic spending within predetermined limits. The long-term solution to the plague of deficit spending, however, is not prudence this year or next. What's needed is reform that will bring discipline and accountability to the budget process. Exemplifying the shortcomings, last year the federal budget was slapped together into a single behemoth bill and delivered to me hours before the federal government was due to run out of money. I was faced with the decision to either sign without time for careful consideration or see the federal government shut down. I pledged during the State of the Union, after plopping down 43 pounds of paper sent to me by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that I would never sign another catchall continuing resolution. I'm pleased that at least 34 Senators and a good number of Congressmen, including many in the leadership, have indicated that they, too, do not want a repeat of last year's budget mayhem. Make no mistake, we have the opportunity to put our fiscal house in order and to reform the budget process. We've proven time and again that by working together, partisanship can be put aside and progress can be made when the national interest is at stake. It took co-operation from both sides of the aisle. For example, to put in place an economic recovery program that has given this country the longest peacetime expansion in history, inflation and interest rates have been kept down. Family income is up. And we created over 15 million new jobs since the recovery began. Being mindful of the suffering that comes with unemployment, that last figure is a matter of particular pride for me. And as our economy is grown, unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since 1979. But that statement does n't come near to describing the success we've enjoyed. Today, more people have jobs and a higher percentage of our work force is employed than ever before. Since the recovery began, we've created more new jobs than in all of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> combined And even the meaning of unemployment figures is sometimes not fully understood. Our 7 million unemployed citizens are often thought of as people who have lost their jobs, as they're sometimes described in the media. In fact, less than half of the unemployed are job losers. Fifty-five percent are new entrants, mainly young people looking for their first jobs, re-entrants _ individuals who left the work force, perhaps to raise a family and are now seeking to get back in _ or job-leavers who've voluntarily left their jobs to change locations or occupations. We, of course, need to remain concerned about each and every citizen who is seeking work, and should not be satisfied until everyone who wants a job _ a good job _ has one. One person enduring the pressures and frustrations of unemployment is too many. That is why responsible federal spending and taxing policies _ policies that foster growth and expand opportunities for all our citizens _ are so important. That is what the budget that I have just sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is all about. Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

 Most people in the first coach car of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train were trying to sleep in the wee hours of Saturday morning when the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zephyr </LOCATION> pulled into the small station here to pick up passengers. The quiet was shattered by the sound of sirens, but no one knew what was going on until they began to smell smoke. There were no crew members in sight. One woman in our group, which was headed for a ski trip in <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, went to investigate. She returned to tell us calmly that there was a fire in a nearby car. It did n't sound serious, and jokes were tossed around while passengers in the car began to stir. We remained in the car, wondering if it was safe, reassuring each other that we would be warned of trouble. Minutes later, a woman crew member ran through the coach, her face blackened with soot. She dashed outside and then returned, saying she'd barely escaped from the crew car where the fire apparently began. Chattering with cold, she said she had no shoes and that her feet were cold. Outside it was about 31 degrees. The woman left, but returned quickly to ask passengers for blankets. Her voice was panicky as she told us people outside the train needed them. I glanced out the window and saw smoke billowing from the crew car two cars ahead. Soon the faint smell of smoke drifted into our car and we decided it was time to get out. As we left the train, it became apparent that the fire was serious. Some crew members, blankets drapped over their shoulders, appeared dazed. One man sat bent over on the steps leading to the upper deck of our coach car. Others were visibly shaken. Outside was a maze of fire trucks, hoses and rescue vehicles. Firefighters on ladders attempted to cut into the crew car's windows with power tools Emergency personnel and volunteers carried stretchers to ambulances. An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> employee yelled to firefighters that he thought there were still people inside the car. Soon, more people were helped from the car. Many were dressed in bedclothes, and some men were bare-chested. By the time a spokesman announced that the train would proceed without the crew car and sleeper car, our group of six had decided to bail out of our weekend trip. We hitched a ride across town in the back of an ambulance, with another vehicle toting our gear. We turned our hopes from fresh powder to finding a rental car; after we got the last one in town, my companions headed back home. One person was dead, others were hurt. My traveling companions kept asking, `` Why were n't we told whether we were in danger or were safe?''

<HEAD>Arizona's Acting Governor Says She's Learning the Ropes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acting Gov. Rose Mofford is getting high marks in her role as temporary chief executive from many legislators but not from the man she replaced, impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s longtime secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, became acting governor Feb. 5 when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. She moved into the governor's office and will remain acting governor until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reaches a verdict. `` My lifestyle has changed,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, 65, told a group of mayors Friday, saying she's switched her bedtime reading to subjects like the state budget or <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Medicaid alternative program. When <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached he was considered legally `` disabled'' and Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> assumed all of his gubernatorial powers, including the right to sign bills and hire or fire state employees. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> brought in her own volunteer staff and replaced one state agency head _ <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who drafted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> into the 1986 gubernatorial race and was widely blamed for many of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s problems. She also accepted the resignation of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s controversial <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>. That angered <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who has moved his own staff to an office building in suburban <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>. In a letter to Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> last week, he complained that she was `` turning a temporary acting governorship into a complete disruption and replacement of my administration.'' `` May I ask you to recognize that I have only been accused and not convicted of any act,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, adding that he expects to be cleared and return to the governorship. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> replied to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, `` I am responsible for acting as the chief executive of this state ... I did not ask for this job, but I intend to discharge it to the best of my ability during these difficult times.'' Lawmakers say they generally are pleased with the work of Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who many had hoped would act mainly as caretaker. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> addresses problems in a calm, deliberate manner,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>, a conservative Republican who headed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment. `` That's a change She's not going off half-cocked.'' `` Have n't you noticed? There's a different air in state government,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` People are n't looking for the next bomb to drop.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces a Feb. 29 impeachment trial on allegations that he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misused $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership, and that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. He is also scheduled for a March 9 criminal trial on six felony counts in connection with the $ 350,000 loan. If <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is convicted in court or by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> becomes governor in her own right. However, that would raise a new series of questions if it occurred before the May 17 recall election. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> has issued a non-binding opinion saying that if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> resigns or is removed before the recall, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> would be subject to removal from office in the recall vote. Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, a Republican who opposed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment, said he realized Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> was entitled to her own staff, but added, `` I do n't think she had a particular mandate to bring in the <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> administration. Many of Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s volunteer aides had worked for former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, a Democrat. But House Minority Leader <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he believes Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is handling the job wisely. `` It's ticklish and it's difficult and it's like no other chief executive in this state has ever found themselves in,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> pleased Democrats and angered some Republicans when she said one of her top priorities would be to seek creation of a Martin Luther King state holiday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> created a storm of controversy in January 1986 when he canceled a holiday for state workers on grounds it was illegally declared by <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> through executive order. Otherwise, there has been little controversy over her policies, including her statement that a tax increase probably would be needed to balance <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s budget. `` I do n't know all the problems that are facing us,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> acknowledged Friday. `` I know that there are criticisms out there, but I do n't think that that will be the last time that I will ever be criticized.''

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Greek Cypriots vote Sunday in the second and decisive round of the most heated presidential election since <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 28 years ago. The outcome is wide open in the race between veteran right-wing leader <PERSON> Glafcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> and political newcomer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>. The candidates, left in the race after they took the top two spots in the first round of voting last Sunday, held their final mass rallies in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> Friday night and fired verbal broadsides at each other. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>, 68, topped last Sunday's poll with 33.32 percent of the vote by the 363,000-strong electorate. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, 56, a millionaire businessman backed by the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Akel, polled 30.11 percent. On paper, <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> goes into Sunday's showdown ballot in the strongest position after the small socialist party, which polled 9.4 percent, announced it will back him. But Sunday's ballot was thrown wide open after President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, eliminated in the first-round vote, refused to back either of the frontrunners. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Diko </ORGANIZATION>, was seeking a third five-year term. He took 27.29 percent last Sunday. He told the 91,000 Greek Cypriots who voted for him that they can back anyone they want. Tens of thousands of flag-waving Greek Cypriots, many bused in from other areas, attended Friday's rallies, held within 500 yards of each other in central <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, jamming streets for hours. Both candidates stressed that Sunday's poll will be the most crucial since the island became independent in 1960. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided since 1974, when the Turkish army invaded to seized the northern third of the island, forcing about 180,000 Greek Cypriots to flee to the south. Turkish Cypriots declared their own republic in the north in 1983. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is the only country to recognize it. The partition of the island, and stalled efforts to reunite the rival communities, has been the dominant issue in the election. Bread and butter issues have taken a back seat. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> have taken a more conciliatory attitude toward reviving negotiations than <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, a hardliner who has been widely blamed for blocking <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to establish a federation. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> said he would resume negotiations with the Turkish side when it withdrew its 35,000 troops from northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> along with the 65,000 settlers <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> shipped from the mainland. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> have said they are willing to resume talks without such preconditions. The Turks invaded, ostensibly to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, after militant Greek Cypriots staged a short-lived coup seeking to unite the island with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. That coup forced the president at the time, Archbishop <PERSON> Makarios </PERSON>, to flee the country. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>, who was then president of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, stood in until <PERSON> Makarios </PERSON> returned in December 1974. <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> has sought to attract wide support by pledging to form an all-party government of national unity to enter into talks with the Turkish Cypriots. To strengthen his strategy, <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> announced during a televised debate Thursday night that he was resigning as leader of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to go into Sunday's ballot as an independent. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> rejected that as an electoral ploy, pointing out that the other three parties have rejected <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON>'s coalition proposal as unworkable. The two frontrunners, who had concentrated on knocking <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> out in the first round, have spent the last week slamming each other. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> accuses <PERSON> Clerides </PERSON> of harboring the extremists involved in the 1974 coup and of being a `` right-wing, anti-labor reactionary.'' The conservative leader has rejected the charges and accuses <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of being a communist pawn.

<BYLINE>Community-Based AIDS Drug Tests Get Support From Presidential

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People with AIDS who have begun their own trials of experimental AIDS drugs found support for their efforts Saturday from members of the President's AIDS commission. `` The most exciting aspect of this project is that it originates from the AIDS community, empowering ourselves to participate in the research that may save our lives and dramatically expand the number of patients who have access to experimental drugs,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON>, administrative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The project uses private physicians and their patients to test ways of preventing development of full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he said. While AIDS drug trials are usually done by government, universities and drug companies, the community based project will include areas of reseach that might otherwise be neglected, he said. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic voiced support for the project after <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> testified at a commission hearing. `` I think what you're doing is introducing an element of competition into the realm of what to do abut the AIDS problem,'' said commission member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>. `` I commend you. I say, ` Right on.''' But commission member <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a physician at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the project's strategy of including intravenous drug abusers among test subjects was `` a bad mistake. `` They are unpredictable at almost the 100 percent level'' and their inclusion will create `` completely flawed material'' in research results, he said. Some researchers say that intravenous drug users are poor research subjects because they often do n't follow instructions and do n't appear for follow-up visits <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> disagreed, saying `` people with this disease have their lives on the line and are willing to cooperate.'' The project is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> With </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON>, who said he has AIDS. The project, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to sponsor treatment trials, already has five experiments under way, he said. Most funding comes from the companies that make the drugs involved, he said. <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, suggested the project also apply to the insurance industry for financial help. Studies must be approved by the organization's institutional review board, which includes physicians, law professors, religious leaders and people with AIDS. Another commission member, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> to `` let us know as specifically as you can what we can do to get more support, more interest'' for such community-based programs. Commission member <PERSON> Beny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primm </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, offered to supply `` responsible intravenous drug abusers who are in treatment from my program any time you want.'' Among the drugs being tested by the community project are pentamidine, being studied in 200 people with AIDS for prevention of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and erythropoietin for anemia brought on by the AIDS drug AZT or the disease itself. Another study in seven people will see if a parasitic infection called cryptosporidiosis can be treated with milk from cows that were injected with the parasite. The idea is that the cows' immune systems would create proteins called antibodies that would attack the parasite, and that the antibodies would be in the milk. A $ 750,000 trial, about to begin with funding from <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will test a drug called Ampligen. With money raised from the community, <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> testified, the project is testing AL-721, an extract from eggs that <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> said thousands of people with AIDS are taking on their own. The project is studying its potential for fighting the AIDS virus and boosting the immune system, he said.

<HEAD>Leader of Terrorist Group, Four Others Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYONNE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of a French Basque terrorist group and four members of his organization were arrested Saturday after a shootout with police, authorities said. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON>, leader of Iparretarrak, had been sought for more than six years. The former schoolteacher was convicted twice in absentia, once for the murder of two police officers, and is suspected in two other slayings of policemen. Iparretarrak, which means `` Those of the North'' in the Basque language, is fighting for independence for the Basque country in southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. It has been less active than the Spanish Basque terrorist movement <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> but has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks. About 20 gendarmes _ members of a police force under direction of the French army _ surrounded <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON> and his companions in a home on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION>, the largest city in the French Basque region. As they emerged about 1 a.m., they were confronted by the gendarmes. Two of the Iparretarrak members, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Etcheveste </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguerre </PERSON>, were wounded by gunfire and taken to the local hospital for treatment. <PERSON> Etcheveste </PERSON> was described as <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON>'s top lieutenant. <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON> and the other two, <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lascaray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiribaren </PERSON>, then surrendered. Defense Minister <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON> sent a message of congratulations to the Gendarmerie, saying the arrests were the result of a long effort `` accomplished in particularly delicate and often dangerous conditions.'' Authorities said only one Iparretarrak member remained at large, <PERSON> Lucienne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON>, and they issued an appeal for her to surrender. `` No harm will be done to her. We known she never intended to kill anyone,'' the Gendermerie in <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> said. `` She can not stay on the run by herself.'' <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON>, 35, had been sought since Nov. 7, 1981, when he was caught on camera during a bank robbery in Saint <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> les </PERSON> <PERSON> Dax </PERSON>, a Basque country town. <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON> was convicted in absentia of murder in the March 19, 1982, slayings of two national policemen killed in St. <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Baigorry </PERSON>, his hometown. He received a life sentence in that case and another life term for a conviction in absentia for the bank robbery. Authorities say <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON> also is believed responsible for two other attacks in which gendarmes died, one on Aug. 7, 1983, and the other last August. During his six years in hiding, <PERSON> Bidart </PERSON> gave one press conference in hiding and made one cassette recording played at the funeral of an Iparretarrak member last June.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response, delivered by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address on Saturday: Hello, this is Congressman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Two days ago the President sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his budget request for fiscal year 1989. But this year something is different. Everybody is shocked at the calm on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. People have gotten used to a set pattern: the budget comes up, the battle lines are drawn, political bombs are dropped, the war begins. This time people wonder why no bombs are being dropped. What's different is the president's budget. The budget that arrived on my desk on Thursday is more realistic than any of the other seven the President has sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In large measure, of course, this is due to the bipartisan agreement between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the budget summit last fall. That agreement established specific limits for the major areas of the budget, including defense spending and domestic programs. It also committed us to an equally important objective: real, permanent significant deficit reduction. The president's budget appears to meet the summit guidelines, which is why we're not seeing the kind of fireworks we've had in the past. Let's give credit where it's due: in at least some areas the president has recognized that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' priorities are also the priorities of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Instead of trying to cut aid to education by 28 percent, as he did last year, the president is proposing a four percent increase from the current funding level. Instead of trying to cut back on the war on drugs, the president would increase spending by 13 percent. And to deal with AIDS, one of our most important health problems, the president is asking for a 40 percent increase in funds for AIDS research and education. But in other areas, this budget is out of line with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s needs and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s values For example, the president's budget would spend more for homes in space than for the homeless here on earth. In fact, funding for the proposed space station would be almost $ 1 billion, but funding for the needs of the homeless would be only $ 219 million, far less than the amount authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The President and his representatives have indicated that this year they want to avoid confrontational politics and acrimonious exchanges, the kinds of things that in previous years led to budget stalemate and huge deficits. Well, we can all agree with that. The success of the budget summit and the prospect of continued administration involvement will, I believe, demonstrate that nothing is wrong with the budget process, nothing that ca n't be fixed by cooperation and compromise on priorities and policies. We proved that the process was n't the problem when, in seven to eight weeks, with cooperation and compromise, we designed and implemented a two-year budget agreement. The spirit and willingness to compromise are the oil that makes the budget process work. We know that the economy has improved recently. Inflation is down, and unemployment, after rising to records in the long recession, is back down to its 1979 level. But we Democrats are concerned about the future. We can not rest comfortably with economic gains built on a policy of borrow, borrow, spend, spend. The deficit is a problem we can not escape by talking about process. Since 1980, our national debt has more than doubled. By next January, it will be almost $ 2.8 trillion. That works out to $ 11,400 for every man, woman and child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and every year we have to pay the interest on that debt. We have made major progress, but we still have a long way to go. If we maintain the bipartisan spirit that came out of the budget summit, we can pass a budget that reduces the deficits and meets the needs of this nation. And if we maintain the spirit of conciliation that has been evidenced so far this year, we can make the budget process work and build a brighter future for the next generation, and an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with greater opportunity. This is Congressman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> beseeched <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Saturday to `` stand firm'' against election year pressure for expensive additions to his $ 1.1 trillion budget, but the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called for more money to help the homeless. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, defending the spending package in his weekly radio speech delivered from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said deficit spending will drop from $ 221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to $ 130 billion in the 1989 fiscal year, which his proposed new budget covers. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> upholds its commitments and stands firm against pressures for increased spending _ pressures that reach a peak during election years _ solid results will be forthcoming,'' the president said. The new budget, sent to Capitol Hill Thursday, was written after a series of consultations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on deficit-reduction goals and outlines of the amounts to be spent on broad categories. As a result, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, the legislative and executive branches `` are demonstrating the kind of responsible leadership expected by the electorate.'' The budget, the president said, `` remains firm in our commitments to essential domestic programs. It also includes funding for the minimum defense programs needed to keep our country safe and necessary to honor our commitments to our friends and allies.'' He called it a `` trim budget'' that keeps the lid on spending, while permitting increases for education, the battle against AIDS and illegal drugs, and air safety programs. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget panel, echoed the president's praise for the budget consultations and the hikes for education, AIDS and narcotics programs `` Let's give credit where its due,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said in the Democratic response. `` In at least some areas, the president has recognized that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' priorities are also the priorities of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' `` In other areas, this budget is out of line with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s needs and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s values,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said His only specific criticism of the package was a request for $ 1 billion to build a manned space station, compared with $ 219 million for programs to help homeless people, `` far less than the amount authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The budget provides `` more for homes in space than for the homeless on earth,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. At the same time, he said, he expected differences to be worked out through compromise and cooperation. `` This year something is different,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` Everybody is shocked at the calm on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. People have gotten used to a set pattern: the budget comes up, the battle lines are drawn, political bombs are dropped, the war begins.'' This time, he said, `` people wonder why no bombs are being dropped.'' `` What's different is the president's budget,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> continued. `` The budget that arrived on my desk on Thursday is more realistic than any of the other seven the president has sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his radio address, repeated his criticism of last year's budget process, saying late amendments to the spending bill required him to sign a hastily assembled package without review, or face the shutdown of the federal government. With the new budget, he said, `` we have an opportunity to put our fiscal house in order.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also repeated his assertions that his administration has presided over the biggest economic expansion since World War II, and he once again hailed his administration's record on employment.

 The Soviets have become more open about announcing their space failures, but failed to announce the destruction of a spy satellite last month and gave out sparse details about a rocket failure, space-watcher <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said Saturday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that the upper stage of the <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> rocket booster failed on Wednesday and that on Thursday `` the Sputniks entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceased their existence.'' According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command, the largest chunk of debris from the mission re-entered the earth's atmosphere Friday afternoon between <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, and a smaller chunk fell earlier near <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Besides the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION>, with three satellites aboard, the Soviets lost another satellite, Cosmos 1,906, on Jan. 31. The imaging satellite was launched on Dec. 26 and was `` blown up to prevent the film and equipment from falling into the hands of western intelligence agencies,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said. Since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said, the Soviets `` have certainly released new material. But there remain severe limits. Military stuff is clearly beyond the limit.'' Still, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said, Western technology can detect such events as the <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> failure, and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> news reports can force further disclosures from the Soviets. Penetrating the secretive Soviet space program is nothing new for <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, who has published his findings in a new book called `` Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost.'' Long before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moderate reforms led to greater disclosure of problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> had pieced together hair-raising tales of disasters that for decades went unreported in the state-controlled media. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> has `` been working since childhood at this, watching their space program, looking for chinks in their secrecy, and driving through them.'' Soviet secrecy can be dangerous, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> wrote in his book. On Oct. 24, 1962, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space probe exploded into dozens of objects during the Cuban missile crisis, the confrontation that brought the superpowers their closest to nuclear war. Debris from the probe `` appeared without warning on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> attack-warning radars in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> wrote. `` The Cuban missile crisis was at its height, and for a few moments the unannounced and unpredicted Soviet space failure looked like the long-feared massive Soviet -LRB- Intercontinental Ballistic Missile -RRB- attack.'' The debris burned up as it entered the atmosphere. But, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said, the Soviets have never publicly acknowledged the event. Soviet media also have not reported on the most spectacular `` and probably the greatest disaster of the space age,'' the `` Nedelin catastrophe,'' which on about Oct. 24, 1960, killed scores of Soviets including Marshal <PERSON> Mitrofan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nedelin </PERSON>, the commander in chief of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces. The accident came three years after the Soviets launched the first satellite, `` Sputnik.'' Operating in the strictest secrecy, the Soviets launched two unmanned spacecraft on a probe to Mars, but both fell back into the atmosphere and burned up because their upper stages failed. A third booster was loaded with fuel, and the order was given to launch. But the main rocket engine did not ignite. `` It just stood there on the launch pad, bathed in searchlights and fuming with clouds of supercold liquid oxygen,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> wrote. `` Nedelin made a fatal error and committed a gross violation of elementary rocket safety standards,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> wrote. `` From the launch bunker, where he had prepared to watch the expected success, he ordered a team of engineers to inspect the rocket booster immediately. ...'' `` Since he was an experienced combat commander, he would not send men into peril he himself avoided, so he walked out to the base of the rocket while the inspection was being made.'' Although the main rocket failed to ignite, the uppermost stage continued to operate as though it were en route to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, and at the time when it would have separated from the booster, fired its own rockets. `` A million pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen flared up in a pyre which must have been visible for hundreds of miles,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> wrote. The Soviet press carried an official obituary of <LOCATION> Nedelin </LOCATION> several days later, saying that he had `` died tragically in the line of duty'' in a plane crash. Not a word has appeared since then in the official press, although writings smuggled out of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> or published by emgres have described the incident, and <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> pieced together the evidence.

 Riot squads Saturday hurled tear gas at hundreds of anti-government demonstrators marching through a fashionable downtown shopping district and calling for fairer election rules. About 500 demonstrators took to the streets and clashed with police after a large rally at a Roman Catholic cathedral. At least two firebombs were thrown by demonstrators, who eventually were scattered by tear gas. No arrests or injuries were reported. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, held an overnight sit-in with about 150 supporters at the party headquarters to protest the government's stand on election rules. The demonstrations were called to protest proposed changes in rules for electing members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the country's parliament Elections are to be held in April. The government is proposing that one to three representatives be elected from each district, based on population. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s supporters want the law to allow for one elected member from each district, regardless of population. The protesters also demonstrated against the Dec. 16 election of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition contends the elections were rigged. The new president is to be inaugurated on Thursday. Rally participants shouted, `` Down with military dictatorship!'' and `` We oppose seizing power through fraudulent election!'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said electing one representative from each district would ensure democratic representation. He also called on the rival opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to endorse his formula, but he charged that the party had made a secret deal to support the government's election formula. The government has held separate talks with the rival opposition groups on reforming rules for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favors a formula of electing more than one representative from each district. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was catapulted to power after the two rival opposition groups split a majority of the votes during the Dec. 16 election.

 When an innocent bystander in an affluent <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighborhood was killed in the crossfire of a gang gunbattle, local merchants asked for more police protection and quickly got it. The swift action following the Jan. 30 incident sparked protest from many blacks and Hispanics, who charged that similar requests from poorer minority neighborhoods fall on deaf ears. A week after the shooting local minority leaders publicized a new study to support claims that police react more slowly to emergencies in less affluent areas. Police Chief <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> released a letter Friday from the study's author saying his findings had been misconstrued. The racial tug-of-war intensified last weekend when an off-duty black police officer was arrested as he stood on a street corner in an upscale neighborhood with six black youths. The officer said his group was conducting an informal `` sting'' operation to investigate alleged police harassment. `` None of those kids did anything except stand on that corner and be black _ and that was enough,'' said <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Police said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s group was blocking the sidewalk. Gang violence fueled by drug trafficking has been a reality for years in the city's predominantly black and Hispanic southside neighborhoods. Drive-by shootings are commonplace, with innocent bystanders being killed by errant or ricocheting bullets. In one recent incident, a 67-year-old woman was killed in a drive-by shooting while she sat in a wheelchair in the doorway of her southside home. There were more than 300 gang-related murders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1987. That figure may rise to 450 this year as gangs battle for control of the lucrative crack cocaine market, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Genelin </PERSON>, head of the district attorney's gang division. `` And that's not the way it should be. We should be able to live normally,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group that claims a membership of 78,000 black families. Gang violence has begun to move into more affluent, mainly white areas, illustrated by the Jan. 30 shooting of 27-year-old <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toshima </PERSON>, who was caught in gang crossfire. She was killed in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a popular theater and restaurant district. When police stepped up patrols in the area, hundreds of southside residents demonstrated at <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, charging that officials ignored daily death tolls in their communities. Minority leaders publicized a just-released study ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The study showed that police responded more slowly to crimes in poor areas than in the more affluent Westside and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the leaders said. The Police Department then released a letter from <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmio </PERSON>, the principal author of the nearly 200-page report, that stated his findings had been misinterpreted. The letter said the actual conclusion was that the Police Department takes too long to respond to emergencies and does not significantly respond more rapidly in any of the city's geographical areas <PERSON> Bellmio </PERSON> said he was under contract not to comment publically until March 8, when he makes a formal report to the police commission. The deployment controversy has fanned other racial issues, such as the alleged harassment that prompted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to conduct his own `` sting.'' In an effort to prove that <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> officers were mistreating blacks, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and six friends gathered on a busy street corner in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, while an associate secretly videotaped the scene. Officers arrested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on a misdemeanor charge and rounded up and frisked the others. Police defended the arrest, saying <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s group was blocking the sidewalk, refused to move when requested by officers and was dressed in attire similar to gang members'. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was released on his own recognizance pending a court hearing. More criticism of the police came Monday when the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Curry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, complained that when officers do patrol black neighborhoods, they come `` ready to do combat.'' Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who is black, signed an ordinance Wednesday that provided for the hiring of 150 more officers, increasing the force to its largest strength ever, 7,500 officers. `` We're determined to return this city to a drug-free, gang-free atmosphere,'' the mayor said. `` I've been telling the people of this city that we need hundreds more police officers,'' said <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the police chief. `` We should focus on getting rid of the problems, and not on the complicated subject of deployment.'' Some criminal experts say more officers wo n't make a difference in poor, crime-infested areas. `` Historically, there's a resentment to an excessive show of force,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Capune </PERSON>, professor of criminology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has a racist overtone, you know; there seems to be more crime because there's more officers,'' he said. `` It becomes a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.'' `` I do n't know what these criminologists are all about,'' snapped City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who represents a mainly black district. `` These guys can sit in some classroom and think what it's supposed to be like. But they have n't seen the real world. I resent them. `` Let them come into the black community and see what it's like.

 A top pingpong player went to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and took her son away from her ex-husband, then hid from Polish authorities until she could sneak the boy into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a newspaper said Saturday. `` I have gone through hell, and the child has gone through hell,'' <PERSON> Kaisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The Denver Post from <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, where she and her son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> arrived Friday. `` Probably this night I can sleep,'' said <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Bohdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawidowicz </PERSON>, also a top table tennis player, from his home in suburban <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON>, 26, has been fighting since 1983 to win custody of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> from her Polish ex-husband, who was initially given custody in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and Polish courts. She got the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ruling reversed, but the Polish ruling stood and she took matters into her own hands a week ago Saturday. She said she took her son away during her regular visit with him in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, then hid in a series of homes, working her way from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> suburbs to the port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. There they boarded a ferry for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> late Thursday. <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON> would n't say exactly how she got her son past Polish police, who were looking for him. `` There are just too many people who could get in trouble,'' she said. <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dawidowicz </PERSON>'s battles with the Polish government began shortly after <PERSON> Dawidowicz </PERSON> decided to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1971 in the middle of an international table tennis tour. Three years later, after going back to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, they won permission for the whole family to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She won tournament after tournament representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams, and in 1978 became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. In 1981, she married <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaca </PERSON>, another Polish immigrant. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was born later that year. They were divorced in 1983, with custody initially given to <PERSON> Gaca </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON> battled back, but her travels on the table tennis circuit worked against her and in 1985 her ex-husband returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with their son. The same year, <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON> introduced new evidence in her case and was awarded custody by an <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> court, but it was too late. <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON> and her father said they were disillusioned by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's hands-off approach. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused to intervene, saying Polish law applied since <PERSON> Gaca </PERSON> had gotten a Polish court to award him custody. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the consular division of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said there is not much the government can do once a child is in another country's jurisdiction. `` We can not do anything that violates the laws of that country,'' she said. `` We can arrange for meetings, to try and arrange some kind of conciliation, but we ca n't force it. We ca n't act as attorneys. <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON>, who has since married a Swedish businessman, hopes to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this summer but says that in the meantime she and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> will relax in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` He needs a little rest. I think he'll be sticking around the house,'' she said.

 Sikh gunmen set off a new wave of violence Saturday in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, killing 10 people and prompting police in the <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dehli </LOCATION> go on red alert. The attacks raised the death toll in violence blamed on the separatist radicals to 32 since Friday. At least 60 others were wounded. `` We are after the killers, the entire police force is on red alert,'' said <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district police superintendent <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON>. Road blocks were set up Saturday throughout the farming state bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s 35,000-member police force was being aided by paramilitary troops in the search operations. In a related development, a Hindu angered by the spate of killings entered a Sikh temple and set fire to Sikh holy book in <LOCATION> Wadala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kala </LOCATION>, a village 26 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> Saturday, police said. `` We are worried, because this will give rise to tension,'' said police officer <PERSON> Rajinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The man, identified as <PERSON> Atma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON>, was arrested. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ram </PERSON>'s younger brother had been slain by suspected Sikh radicals last month `` He was angry after he heard the news of the new killings. He went inside a Gurdwara -LRB- Sikh shrine -RRB- and set fire to the holy book,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. Sikh militants have been fighting for a separate homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. Sikhs are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, but comprise only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people, more than 80 percent of whom are Hindus. The radicals want an independent homeland because they say the Hindus discriminate against them. At least 250 people have been killed in Sikh-related violence this year. Last year more than 1,000 deaths were blamed on the separatists. Among Saturday's victims were two Hindu farm laborers, a Hindu trader and four Sikh farmers. The remaining three have yet to be identified, police chief <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> said. One person wounded in a bomb blast Friday died of injuries Saturday, hospital sources said. In the village of <LOCATION> Sahsra </LOCATION>, nine members of farm family were killed with automatic rifles and revolvers Friday night, along with a man staying at the house, <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> said. Residents in the village, about 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, said about six Sikh gunmen stormed into the home while the family slept. Earlier Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> bomb attacks killed 11 people. The bomb attacks were in the cities of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION>, Gurdaspur and <LOCATION> Hoshiarpur </LOCATION>. The bombings later prompted police in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to issue a red alert because of fears that the attacks might spread to the capital. On Saturday an unexploded bomb was found in a fifth city, <LOCATION> Batala </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency said the four-pound can of explosives was left in a store by a woman customer in the city 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> advised residents not to pick up unknown objects and report movement of new people in their neighborhood. The Sikh faith has elements of both <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam and was founded about 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to the two warring religions. But the Sikhs' 10th and last prophet, Guru <PERSON> Govind </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, declared <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> as a warrior faith in which the adherents should all carry swords and the male should bear the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, `` Lion'' in <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION>.

 The 16-year-old accused of the ax murders of four members of his family wrote poetry and was so gentle `` he would n't step on a flower,'' friends say, but those closest to him also saw a darker side. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, who faces four charges of first-degree murder in the slayings of his mother, father, sister and brother, had expressed frustration and anger about his parents, and was drawn to hard-core, punk-rock bands with songs of pain, insanity and death. `` I saw the school side of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. I think you're going to find there were a lot of faces,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Krough </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s teacher and the chaplain of <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> A favorite of <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s, according to one friend, is the group `` Suicidal Tendencies.'' A song on their latest album describes `` the maniac I'll meet. His love for me is like a father to a son. And now the maniac and I are one.'' The high school sophomore was arrested Friday after an all-night manhunt in this city of 62,000 about 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. Friends, according to <PERSON> Krough </PERSON>, had heard <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> muse </PERSON> recently about wanting to hurt his family. They regarded that as an expression of typical teen-age alienation but never as a serious plan, the priest said. To most, <PERSON> David </PERSON> had a quiet magnetism at school, <PERSON> Krough </PERSON> said. He was an avid bicyclist but not a `` jock.'' And he was n't active in other extra-curricular activities at the 415-student parochial school, principal <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` There was a group of students he was the center of,'' <PERSON> Krough </PERSON> said. `` I guess you would tend to call him an artistic, poetic kind of person, a deep-feeling person.'' About <PERSON> David </PERSON> and his friends, <PERSON> Krough </PERSON> said, `` If there was ever a group of adolescents that fit the image of sensitive teens, that group would qualify.'' Many of <ORGANIZATION> Brom </ORGANIZATION>'s friends wrote letters to be delivered to the Olmsted County Jail, and they defended him fiercely when questioned by reporters. The punk appearance he adopted the day of the killings, including shaving the sides of his head, dying his hair black and spiking it on the back of his head, seemed out of character to some. `` He would n't step on a flower,'' said schoolmate <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromelkamp </PERSON>, whose locker is next to <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s. `` He may have done something wrong, but there's a lot of people he touched.'' Authorities were far from understanding what may have triggered the slayings, but Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said one small piece came out in interviews with <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s friends. The teen-ager and his father had an argument about a tape the boy had taken home, he said. Also unexplained was how a boy described as an almost frail 130 pounds could commit the slayings with a 28-inch ax without anyone in the house escaping. Chief Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would not comment on other details of the murders, such as where the weapon was obtained or why the suspect stayed in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> after the killings. The victims were <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, 41, <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON>, 40, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, 11. The only family survivor other than <PERSON> David </PERSON> is his 19-year-old brother <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who has his own apartment in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> is dominated by the Mayo Clinic and an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> plant where the elder Brom worked. Mrs. <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> had recently quit her job at the church to spend more time with her children, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> David </PERSON> did not appear to possess his parents' devout religious faith, <PERSON> Krough </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> was a searcher,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>, `` the king of country music,'' celebrated his 50th anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry by citing the fans of the long-running show. <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>, 84, received a standing ovation Friday night when he appeared on the stage to mark his golden anniversary on the live program. `` This is a little special occasion for <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>,'' he told the audience after singing his best-known song, `` The Wabash Cannonball.'' `` I'm proud to have lived to see this day,'' he said. `` You are the ones who made <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> and the Grand Ole Opry. Have fun, I'm going to. Moments before, when the curtain went up and the crowd rose, <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> playfully told the audience, `` Sit down so I can sing.'' He later sang his version of `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,'' a song <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> also turned into a hit. `` That was written for me by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> many, many years ago,'' <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> told the audience, which included representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> from 22 countries. `` Then <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> brought it back. He did a good job with it.'' <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> also saluted his dobro player, <PERSON> Bashful </PERSON> <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, who also was celebrating his 50th anniversary on the show. `` We have n't had a fight yet,'' <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> said. Other Opry stars joined in honoring <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>, a fiddler who came out of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> hills to become the Opry's first genuine singing star. `` That's a long time, folks,'' singer <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said about the 50 years of performing. `` I hope he's here another 50.'' Singer <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagoner </PERSON> called <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> `` one of the grandest men in country music.'' Singer <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> dedicated her song `` Once a Day'' to him. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, were to have appeared on the show during a special segment honoring <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>, but canceled because both have the flu, Opry officials said. The pry bills itself as the longest running radio show still on the air. It has never missed a broadcast since going on the air in 1925, meaning <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> has been on the program for all but 13 years of its existence.

 There are signs that child heart transplant recipients develop atherosclerosis and also have a worse survival rate than adults given new hearts, a transplant surgeon says. Dr. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, chief of the cardiac replacement service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said he has seen `` indications of development of atherosclerosis'' in child transplant recipients, and `` it may become more of a trend.'' Atherosclerosis is the thickening of the internal lining of the blood vessels and the cause of coronary artery disease. As for survival rates, `` I think it is worse than adults,'' with infection the leading cause of death among children, <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, a specialist in the use of artificial devices and in pediatric transplantation, said Friday at an international conference on thoracic organ transplantion. He said children who have received transplants do not have worse problems with organ rejection than adults. But he said there is an increasing number of child transplants who need retransplantation because of progressive failure of the organs they have been given. `` I do n't know what that means, but my suspicion is that if we transplant children in infancy we will probably have to retransplant at some point again,'' <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said. There was encouraging news on transplants from a leader in transplantation for extremely young infants, Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who said some of his patients have exhibited an `` immune tolerance'' not seen in adults. As a result, several of the young recipients need only extremely small doses of the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine and may be withdrawn entirely from all drug therapy. `` My guess is that a number of the babies will be able to grow up without the need for immunosuppression,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. Cyclosporine is used in transplantation in combination with other drugs to suppress the body's immune system and keep it from turning against the donor heart. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he believes the optimal therapy is diagnosis `` of heart disease in-utero, because that gives us a chance then from 35 weeks on to find a donor.'' He said that in his program's experience, transplants after more than the first few weeks of a child's life make for a `` much more difficult post-operative management problems. ... Those who have been transplanted in the first month of life have really been a piece of cake.'' Infants more than 3 to 3 -LCB- months old given transplants `` will reject with considerable vigor,'' requiring aggressive anti-rejection therapy, said <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who has performed heart transplants on the world's youngest infants, including a four-hour-old Canadian boy last October.

 The surgeon who transplanted a baboon's heart into an infant girl in 1984 says he's optimistic about the continuing research toward eventual use of animal heart transplants in humans `` We're still really working vigorously in that area from all points of view, goats and sheep and primates,'' Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said at a three-day international conference on thoracic organ transplantation that concluded Saturday. Researchers have turned to exploring the use of non-human organs for transplantation on either a temporary or possibly permanent basis, in part because of the lack of sufficient organ donors. In a controversial procedure in October 1984, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and his staff at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> transplanted the heart of a baboon into a 12-day-old girl known as Baby Fae. The child, born with a fatal heart defect, survived for 20 days before her body's immune system rejected the foreign-tissue transplant, or xenograft. Rejection has been a major obstacle in xenografts. Another problem area has been the ethical question of using a primate heart in humans, said Dr. <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon at one of the nation's busiest transplant centers, said chimpanzees `` are almost too close'' to humans in terms of behavior and would raise a moral dilemma. `` Nobody is talking about using chimpanzees, and yet they in fact are the most size-appropriate probably to use,'' he said. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> added that baboons' hearts are small for human use and might eventually be used more appropriately as auxiliary hearts. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the testing that has been conducted at the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, facility has involved a series of experiments, testing the `` xenograft bridge to allograft theory, and it's working out very well. An allograft is a same-species organ transplant. The testing, he said, includes using xenografts of green monkey hearts into baboons in temporary bridge-to-transplant situations. `` We still very firmly believe that a well-selected primate heart from a baboon will be virtually as good'' as a human allograft `` that may have no tissue match whatsoever and bear very little resemblance and genetic makeup'' to the original _ even as a permanent graft, he said.

<TEXT>
 American banker and philanthropist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> unveiled a private non-profit foundation Saturday that he said will aid hard-pressed farmers in this communist country. <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> met privately with Polish communist leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> before formally inaugurating the foundation, which will raise pigs and export hams to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It seems to me that what we all need to do is to find ways in which despite the ideological differences, we can work together,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> said at a ceremony in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Royal Castle. Organizers said the foundation brings <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> its first new long-term Western credits since the 1981 martial law crackdown and will serve as a model for Western institutions wishing to provide financial assistance to the debt-stricken country. But the size of the credits, $ 2.4 million, is miniscule compared to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s burgeoning foreign debt, now standing at $ 39.2 billion. The Foundation for the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is the result of the personal interest of Rockefeller and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' Fund, said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON>, chairman of the foundation's organizing committee Its first project will be the development of swine production to increase exports of premium Polish hams to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 14 percent. The foundation will borrow money to import to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> high-protein feed concentrates from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for sale to Polish farmers under a contract arrangement. The farmers will use the feed to raise swine more efficiently. The swine will be sold to Polish meat processors in partnership with the foundation. Hams resulting from the arrangement will be exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with a portion staying in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for domestic sale. Proceeds from the exports will repay foreign loans and be used for other foundation projects, Irish said. Unlike other East bloc nations where cooperative farming predominates, private farmers control 75 percent of the farmland in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and produce 80 percent of the crop. The foundation is to be governed by a council with 60 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Western European membership and 40 percent private Polish membership.

 South African fighter planes flew revenge raids on guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at dawn Saturday, a day after a bomb killed 18 people in a Namibian bank. Angolan authorities said several civilians were killed. More than a dozen Mirage and <ORGANIZATION> Impala </ORGANIZATION> aircraft attacked three bases of the South-West African Peoples Organization in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief, Gen. <PERSON> Jannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON>, said in a statement. He said the attacks avenged the bombing Friday of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where 18 people were killed and 31 injured. Most of the dead were black government employees cashing their weekly paychecks. <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> of the bank bombing. The guerrilla group has been fighting for 22 years against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> denied involvement in the bank blast, the deadliest in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in two decades. It has claimed responsibility for other bombings in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> declined to comment on Saturday's raid. Later Saturday, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s defense ministry said the air assault on <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Onjiva </PERSON> left several civilians dead. A statement reported by the official Angolan news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> said the exact number of victims had not yet been determined, according to a report monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> report made no mention of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON>' announcement On Friday, South African Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> `` Pik'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> warned neighboring states that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> troops would undertake unannounced `` hot pursuit'' raids across borders to fight guerrilla groups. `` We have repeatedly invited them -LRB- neighboring states -RRB- to talk with us to sort our problems in peace. Now they have demonstrated they are not interested,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said, reacting to news of the Namibian bombing. `` As far as I'm concerned there is no more talk of a regional conference _ not from our side. We're no longer interested in the neighboring states.'' <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said eight Mirage fighters took part in the attack on two targets near <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION>, about 190 miles north of the Namibian-Angolan border; and five <ORGANIZATION> Impala </ORGANIZATION> aircraft attacked targets at <LOCATION> Ongiva </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of the border. <PERSON> Geldenhuys </PERSON> said all the South African aircraft returned safely, but gave no estimate of casualties inflicted. He said the <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION> targets were `` <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s most important training center in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hainyeko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and a terrorist holding area about 10 kms -LRB- 6.2 miles -RRB- west of there.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the jets that attacked <LOCATION> Lubango </LOCATION> were probably Mirage F1-As, a French-designed fighter-bomber capable of carrying about 14,000 pounds of bombs. The Impalas are a South African version of an Italian Aermacchi light attack craft. They can carry Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and are able to carry about 4,000 pounds of missiles or bombs. The general said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had launched a number of attacks from <LOCATION> Ongiva </LOCATION> on civilians in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1971, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> was illegal. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has defied the court and continued its occupation. Only about 70,000 of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people are white, and the South African government has installed a multiracial transitional administration to run the territory's affairs. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has refused to negotiate with the transitional government, citing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution demanding free elections. South African and South-West African troops have been fighting for about five months in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement, which is battling the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. South African officials say they will not grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> until the 40,000 Cuban troops supporting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government leave <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. All of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black-ruled neighbors _ <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ have accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of staging unannounced cross-border raids during the past 10 years, killing dozens of civilians as well as alleged guerrillas. South African officials have denied, refused to comment on, or ridiculed most of the claims, although they did announce a raid last year on <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. But military officials have acknowledged previous `` hot pursuit'' operations against <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> presented their statement Friday as a new get-tough policy against neighboring governments which, they say, allow the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and other guerrilla organizations to stage attacks on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from their territories. By law and custom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 The organizer of a planned blood bank for chaste donors says he hopes to expand into a national network of Christian blood banks, a plan one physician called a dangerous attempt to capitalize on fear of AIDS. Dr. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he hopes to open LifeBlood, a Christian blood bank that will not accept promiscuous donors, by early April. Blood donors will be asked to sign a statement confirming they have abstained from sex or been faithful to a spouse since 1977. The blood also will be tested for AIDS and other blood-borne viruses, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` My intention is to inform heterosexuals that if they have more than one faithful partner that they are at risk of developing a deadly disease ... and to provide blood from people who do not fall into that category,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. But Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilcher </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> inaccurately implies that LifeBlood's supply will be safer than other blood banks. And <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s list of risk categories does not include promiscuous heterosexuals. `` What we see this doing is undermining the donor base ... confusing people, creating distrust and a lack of credibility,'' <PERSON> Gilcher </PERSON> said. `` We think that is a dangerous thing.'' `` I commend what he's doing in the sense of trying to create a safer blood supply because that's what we're all doing, but the method by which Dr. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> is trying to do this I think is unsound,'' <PERSON> Gilcher </PERSON> said. `` I think it's dangerous because it could create a lack of availability of blood products.'' <PERSON> Gilcher </PERSON> said existing blood banks already screen donors and test donated blood. `` The blood supply is safe, but it's not 100 percent safe,'' <PERSON> Gilcher </PERSON> said. `` There is no such thing as a zero risk. The public wants a zero risk, but it does n't exist.'' <PERSON> Gilcher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' exclusion of heterosexuals who have had more than one partner since 1977 relies on the honesty of the donor and the honesty of the donor's sexual partner. He said it also dangerously limits the pool of potential donors. But <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he thinks chaste and faithful donors can supply the nation with blood. `` Five percent of the nation provides the blood for the entire nation,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` I am confident that there is 5 percent of the nation that is chaste. Our goal is to identify those individuals and encourage them to give blood, take a stand for morality and administer the love of Christ through blood donations.'' AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. One method of transmission is through infected blood or blood products. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> requires all blood banks to provide potential donors with information about AIDS and ask them to refrain from donating if they fall into certain risk categories. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> constantly reviews categories,'' <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said. `` The category of promiscuous heterosexuals was discussed in 1986. Epidemiologists concluded at that time that the heterosexual spread of HIV -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- was not a significant reason to exclude this category.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he plans to sell blood on a first-come, first-served basis regardless of religion or sexual activity. For a fee, donors will be allowed to have their own blood frozen for their own use. `` The cost of the blood is going to be determined primarily by the number of donors that we have. We hope it will be comparable to the -LRB- non-profit -RRB- <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Institute </LOCATION>. We may be at a disadvantage because we have to pay taxes,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said.

 A motorist whose heart was apparently bigger than his nose rescued an injured skunk Saturday but could not find an animal hospital to help, police said. The man, whom police declined to identify, found the animal off Interstate 393 and bundled it into his car. He first took the skunk to the Fish and Game Department, but no one was there, so he went to the police, said Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>. `` We could n't find an animal hospital who would do something with an injured skunk,'' he said. The animal apparently had been hit by a vehicle and was badly injured, so police put it out of its misery, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said.

 A sit-in launched by 200 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> students at the start of a snowy holiday weekend seemed doomed by doubt and disarray, leaders of the little rebellion by minorities recalled. `` You do not take a building on a night before a major snowstorm that will close it anyway and which is going to be closed for an entire holiday weekend,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thelwell </PERSON>, a black professor, said he warned the protesters at the start of the occupation. But by the end of the six-day occupation of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, hundreds of white students had displayed their sympathy in rallies and vigils, money and supplies had poured in from around the nation and even the chancellor had expressed admiration for the protesters, who won several concessions from the school. `` We were n't organized. All we had were these five little demands,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, a negotiator for the group. `` But something had brought us all together. That was the fascinating thing. By the third day, we knew it was working.'' The takeover began Feb. 11 after students met with Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> to discuss the demands. Troubled by recent acts of racial violence on campus, the protesters insisted on the disciplining of five white students accused of beating two blacks, and they demanded a stop to the encroachment of other school departments on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, a Third World center. Tension had festered since an October 1986 beating of a black student by several whites following the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> loss to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> in the final game of the World Series. The disorganized protesters refused to meet with <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> the morning after the takeover, but began forming committees to handle finances, security, media questions and negotiations, and they imposed strict procedures on meetings. The rules proved successful. `` We started voting on everything,' Costello said. `` We even voted on which movies to watch.'' Support began pouring in from the campus and beyond. The <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> said members would risk arrest with the protesters if the chancellor called in police to remove them from the building, Costello said. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> volunteered to strike in the same event, she said. Some 500 white students staged a rally outside the building to lend their support. Costello said she knew the protesters had won widespread support when she went to a nearby dormitory for a shower: `` They said, ` You all from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> House?' I said, ` Yeah. Anybody got any soap?' They ran to get it. They'd give us deodorant, anything.'' Costello was among four women and five men elected by the protesters to negotiate with the chancellor. A meeting scheduled for Monday had to be postponed when <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> went to visit a brother who had undergone major surgery. The protesters sent the chancellor a card and <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> responded with a basket of fruit. `` We had old-timers with us saying, ` My god, I've been going to sit-ins for 20 years and I've never seen anything like this,'' Costello said. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and the students met Tuesday and talked for more than four hours. But then the group that had been occupying the house was suddenly outnumbered by minorities returning to the campus from the holiday weekend. `` They were acting like we'd sold out,'' saidCostello. `` I was really hurt by all these people who had n't been there the whole time. I asked them, ` Where were you?''' The newcomers left early Wednesday and the stalwart core voted to accept <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s responses to their demands, which included timetables for the hiring of minority faculty and a promise to leave the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> in the hands of the Third World community. Costello said the agreement was a victory that will enhance the school's image among whites and blacks. `` I think UMass will get the reputation of fighting racism,'' she said. `` This is terrific, what's happening here.''

 Relief services for about 260,000 Palestinian refugees in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be cut to the minimum because of the kidnapping of two Scandinavian employees of the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said Saturday. `` There will be noticeable changes in <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> services and activities because of security problems and the lack of freedom of movement,'' said agency spokesman <PERSON> Niall </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiely </PERSON>. `` We feel agency staff, be they foreign nationals or locals, are under threat to their physical safety.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44 of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, were kidnapped Feb. 5. <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> said Palestinians, acting independently of guerrilla factions, kidnapped the men for personal motives. <PERSON> Kiely </PERSON> said only four of the 14 international staff assigned to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> remained in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and `` they are very heavily involved in the search for Stening and <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>.'' He said he was `` reasonably hopeful'' that the Scandinavians would be released because `` there are no real setbacks'' in negotiations.

 The government in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators of trying to ruin Soviet-American relations and scuttle nuclear disarmament by encouraging nationalist demonstrations in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The official Soviet news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> issued a statement saying the senators are `` taking part in a new propaganda farce. They advocate a favorable attitude to anti-Soviet actions planned to be held in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> by some groups.'' `` Such steps can further only one political aim _ to hamper the improvement of Soviet-American relations and to undermine the nuclear disarmament process,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The statement was the latest manifestation of a dispute between the government and nationalist activists, supported by Western politicians, over the fate of the Baltic states. The states, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, were independent until they were incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. Some residents believe their national identity and religious freedom are suppressed under Soviet rule. Moscow-based dissidents said some Lithuanians demonstrated Tuesday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the declaration of independence from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> months after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Wednesday is <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s anniversary of independence, and activists say they plan protests there also. This month, 32 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators wrote to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asking him not to interfere with demonstrations and religious services in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>. The senators urged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` not only to allow the Lithuanian and <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> people to peacefully honor their national independence days, but also to take all necessary measures to guarantee that they do not become targets of state-sponsored harassment.'' <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s Presidium shot back that `` those who call into question the choice made by <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in 1940, when it joined the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics as a full-fledged member, oppose the will of our people, the policy of perestroika, the principles of humanism and the policy of peace.'' Perestroika is the name of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging program to reform Soviet society. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged the nationalities problem remains thorny. He said Soviets must respect the language and culture of national groups but that nationalism aimed at `` self-isolation lead only to a spiritual blind alley.'' The Presidium statement also acknowledged the nationalities problem, but said some people are taking advantage of the recent Soviet campaign for openness `` as a means of kindling hostility among the nationalities living on Estonian territory. This fully applies to the groups that emerged in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> which try to put <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION> and its history in a bad light.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, the republic's nominal parliament, issued the statement. Last August, thousands of people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s capital and those of the other Baltic states on the anniversary of a secret agrement between <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> the led to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> takeover of the Baltic states in 1940 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has never recognized the Soviet incorporation of the Baltic states. In a related development, an Estonian political activist and his family of six arrived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> Saturday after being expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. About 30 exiles greeted <PERSON> Rein </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, his wife and five small children at the airport. <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> told Swedish television at <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Arlanda </LOCATION> airport he was the leader of a `` religious and political association.'' He said he expected `` 30-40'' more members of his congregation could be forced to leave. `` I greet you in the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' he told some 30 exiles at the airport. Last weekend two converted Estonian Buddhists arrived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> after given the choice of going to jail or leave the country. One of them, Eke-Part Nomm, 22, said he had probably been forced to leave because he read an appeal to form an <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at a meeting in the city of <LOCATION> Tartu </LOCATION> on Feb. 2.

 A leader of the congressional Iran-Contra probe says he ca n't understand why Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remains reluctant to discuss his role in the affair months after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened the administration's books. `` I do n't know why he's been so hesitant to acknowledge that he supported the president in it'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counsel in the investigation. `` He was not a decisive factor.'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, 55, was on the Hawaiian island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> on Thursday preparing to address Tuesday's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an association of judges.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s yearlong Nazi war crimes trial was supposed to serve as a vivid history lesson to young Israelis, but it gave way to lengthy technical debates that some say trivialized the horrors of the Holocaust. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, the second man to stand trial in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes charges, became more human to many Israelis than <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the first, because he learned some Hebrew and his family attended nearly every session. He chatted with police guards, laughed good naturedly during sessions and shouted the Hebrew greeting `` Shalom'' to bystanders as he was led handcuffed to and from court. He even tried to shake hands with a death camp survivor, who recoiled in horror and called <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> a murderer. But any sympathy <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> might have won was virtually undone by a stumbling defense team that seemed to move two steps backward for every step forward. For months before the trial ended last week, Israelis stood in line to get a seat in the converted movie theater where five Holocaust survivors recounted how a guard called `` Ivan the Terrible'' mutilated Jews with sadistic pleasure before driving them into gas chambers at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But interest waned and frustration mounted when the survivors' emotional accounts of Nazi atrocities were replaced by a time-consuming, often repetitive debate over the issue of identification <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 67, a retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker, maintains he is not <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> but an innocent victim of mistaken identity. `` This trial truly displayed the banality of justice,'' <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON>, a New York-born Israeli and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> hunter, said in an interview. `` There's no question that people got frustrated by the triviality and technicalities.'' Hundreds of exhibits, even a paperclip, were submitted in an effort to determine the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution evidence, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s alleged Nazi identity card. Six prosecution experts testified the card was authentic and an equal number of defense witnesses maintained it was forged. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> contended the document was fabricated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to punish him for fighting in an anti-communist unit at the end of World War II. For many Israelis, there was a difference between <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the man who masterminded <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s final solution, and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, who carried them out. <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> was convicted and hanged in 1962. Unlike <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, whom spectators glimpsed only as he was tried behind a bullet-proof screen, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> had a human dimension that intensified the emotion of the trial. The Ukrainian-born defendant's wife, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, his three children and 2-year-old grandson frequently watched the proceedings from front row seats and their anguish was recorded in Israeli newspapers and on television. `` Shame on you! You have no heart!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> screamed tearfully at prosecutors when the trial ended Thursday and accused them of lying and failing to give her husband a fair trial. The three-judge panel, which has retired to review more than 15,000 pages of testimony and some 500 exhibits, is expected to issue a verdict in April. If convicted, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of death. But it is widely believed the sentence will not exceed life in prison. On Thursday, one member of the audience, Holocaust survivor <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, 63, displayed the pain of dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims who attended the proceedings over the year. Waving a tattered photograph of his parents, three brothers and a sister killed at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, he sobbed: `` The defense lawyers are liars. ... Why does this have to be such a performance?'' But many Israelis believe the attempt to probe into details showed the trial was fair. `` It was n't a quick open-and-shut case,'' said <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, a Cleveland-born Israeli. `` No matter what the verdict, no one can ever say there was n't enough time spent on detail. That's important, because people will ask whether Jewish judges can be fair in a war crimes trial. Some of his supporters, however, claimed <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> did not get a fair hearing, partly because of his own faltering defense team and the trial's publicity. Some witnesses watched others testify on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television before they took the stand. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, frustrated by his defense, fired <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, his attorney of seven years, midway through the proceedings. Several defense witnesses were discredited, including one who retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide after her credentials were called into question. Some of the defense arguments seemed bizarre. Even <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> squirmed uncomfortably in his seat when a defense expert claimed the Soviet secret service used `` thought power'' to kill its enemies and inflict disasters on the West. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s own contradictory version of his whereabouts during World War II also appeared to hurt his case. `` Until the defense began its case, I was not convinced of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s guilt,'' said <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Offer </PERSON>, a 31-year-old Israeli sculptor. `` But the defense itself has erased the doubts.''

 Fire officials and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> researchers Saturday picked through the rubble of a nationally known laboratory for maple tree research destroyed by fire. The laboratory at the university-affiliated <ORGANIZATION> Proctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> was engulfed in flames Friday night in a fire of undetermined origin, university officials said. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Laing </PERSON>, an associate professor long involved in research at the farm, said efforts in recent years had centered on finding a cause for declines in maple syrup production in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and around the Northeast. Much of that research had been looking into whether acid precipitation, atmospheric pollutants carried into the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> on winds out of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, was to blame for recent maple production declines. <PERSON> Laing </PERSON> said Saturday that it was now `` generally agreed that it -LRB- acid rain -RRB- is one of the stresses'' causing the slump in maple sugaring. `` There's still some difficulty in assessing just how large a part it plays.'' The fire, which <PERSON> Laing </PERSON> said destroyed between $ 200,000 and $ 250,000 worth of equipment, comes with this year's maple sugar season about a month away. It was unclear Saturday whether the lab or some replacement facility could be geared up in time. <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levigne </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UVM </ORGANIZATION> assistant vice president for buildings and facilities, said while the cause of the fire was unknown, it was not believed to have been arson.

<TEXT>
 Possibly spooked by light at the end of the tunnel, deer have been shy about using four passageways recently installed for them under a new <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> interstate highway. The State Highway Administration built four corrugated steel culverts under sections of Interstate 97 near <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> in hopes of encouraging animals to cross under instead of over the roadway. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frostburg </LOCATION> are trying to find out if animals are using the underpasses. So far they've found mink, mice, muskrat and raccoon, but no deer have ventured through the dimly lighted pathways. `` To us, the opening -LRB- at the other end -RRB- looks fairly large,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, a graduate assistant working on the project. `` But for deer, it's like going into a cave or tunnel and they are n't used to going into enclosures.'' Several other states have tried culverts, but little has been done to document their use. The state and federal highway administrations are funding the $ 210,000, five-year study in hopes of finding a way to reduce the number of animals killed on American highways. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, an estimated 200,000 deer die each year on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roads. However, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> ecologist, said the number was a conservative estimate. More than 25,000 are killed each year on roads in states with high deer populations, such as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The study also aims to learn more about what happens to a wildlife area when it is bisected by a highway. The interstate cuts through woods near <LOCATION> Crownsville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Researchers are observing tracks and using a wildlife surveillance system to monitor animal activity in the culverts. Movement at the tunnel openings trips sensors on video cameras, which film the activity day or night. `` So far we had a deer enter the culvert and then come back out,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. Recent flooding inside the tunnels might have discouraged some animals from using them, but <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said he suspected the culverts might not be large enough. Three of the culverts are 15 feet high, 21 feet wide and about as long as a football field. The fourth is even longer, at more than 500 feet. Perhaps the deer assume they can not get through what they perceive is a tiny opening at the other end, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` The only evidence I have is that we have had several deer approach the culverts, but they have not gone in,'' he said. If the culverts prove successful, they would be a cheaper than bridges, which cost four to five times more to build and maintain, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>, environmental specialist with <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s highway administration

 The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Communist Party has accused communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of bombing a South Korean airliner that vanished with 115 aboard off the coast of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> last November. The party, in an official publication obtained Saturday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, stressed that communism has nothing to do with terrorism and that true communists should denounce such violence. `` We firmly believe that the north actually did it,'' wrote party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyamoto </PERSON> in the publication. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has denied any involvement in the jet's disappearance, and accused <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of engineering the incident to malign <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> The Korean Air Boeing 707, on its way from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, disappeared on Nov. 29. On Jan. 15, a woman said in a public confession in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> that she was a North Korean agent and that she and a male North Korean agent had planted a bomb on the aircraft during an earlier leg of the plane's flight. The woman, identified as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON>, 26, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, son and heir apparent of North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, had ordered the sabotage because he wanted to disrupt the 1988 Summer Olympics, to begin in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sept. 17. The North Korean pair, traveling on forged Japanese passports, left the plane in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, its last stop before it vanished, flew to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and were stopped for questioning at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Dec. 1. Both swallowed poison before being questioned. The man died but the woman survived. She was extradited to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Dec. 15. Japanese communists have been at odds with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> communist leaders since the early 1970s over ideological differences, often denouncing the personality cult surrounding <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>.

The friendship between the two cities began in January, when the mayor of <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, sent New Year's greetings to the people of <LOCATION> Dixon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> replied, suggesting a citizen exchange visit, and he announced earlier this month that he had been notified that <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>'s mayor, an interpreter and a journalist will visit <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> for a week, though no date has been set The <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> newspaper tries to show everyday life in that Siberian city, which is roughly a third the size of <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, a community of 15,000 in north-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 The government is sending tortilla-grams to remind illegal aliens that the deadline to apply for immigration amnesty is less than three months away. `` We're trying anything we can think of to get people the information,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Friday </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has printed 80,000 Spanish-language reminders on 4-by-6-inch pieces of paper, and next week plans to send them to tortilla factories in <LOCATION> Brownfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lovington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, where they will be stuffed into packages. `` We have had lots of publicity in larger areas. The purpose of this grass-roots publicity campaign is to get out the word in the smaller areas,'' Ms. Friday said. The text of the inserts says: `` Act now. Take advantage of the legalization program. Amnesty ends May 4, 1988. If you have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally since before Jan. 1, 1982, perhaps you qualify. For peace of mind, legalize your status. For more information, please contact your local legalization office.'' The bakeries agreed to include the reminders in their tortilla packages as a public service and at no charge to the government, Ms. Friday said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has been using more traditional outlets _ churches, schools and public service broadcasts _ to remind people in metropolitan areas that the government's amnesty offer expires May 4.

 <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> got bad news again last week. Their latest application for an exit visa was turned down by Soviet authorities. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON> learned Friday that he, too, had once more been refused. Their disappointment was aggravated by the timing, for the latest rejection notices arrived on the eve of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an event many Jewish `` refuseniks'' had hoped would help get them out. In the past, the Soviets often have lowered emigration barriers just before high-level U.S.-Soviet talks, but there is no indication <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s scheduled arrival on Sunday has had much effect. `` People are pinning so many hopes on him that I'm afraid it's going to be a very pathetic frustration for many,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> said `` There is nothing to pin your hopes on now.'' A senior Western diplomat who watches trends in Soviet emigration and other human rights matters, said, `` What had been some fairly steady but limited improvement -LRB- last year -RRB- may have come to a halt.'' As for freeing of political prisoners, `` the process has stopped'' following the release last year of dozens of religious, humans rights and nationalist activists, the diplomat said. He spoke only on condition he not be identified. Observers say one possible reason the flow of Jewish emigrants appears to have slowed from last year's unusually high levels is that the issue is receiving less official and public attention now. Most of the best-known `` refuseniks'' have left in recent months, said one diplomatic analyst, and although thousands of would-be emigrants are left behind, they are n't as well organized and do n't have as effective a voice as some of the Jewish activists who have recently been granted exit visas. The Ziemans first applied for permission to emigrate when their daughter, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, was a baby. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> is now 11 years old and has grown up knowing she and her family could leave at any time. But while they wait, they are outcasts. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, 50, lost his job as a computer programmer in the biomedical field as soon as he applied to leave and worked until recently as a janitor. The family's plight has taken on a new urgency since <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> suffered a potentially deadly aneurysm in the brain several weeks ago and doctors warned him not to risk the delicate surgery to repair the afflicted artery unless he can reach the West. Although <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> says he never had access to state secrets, the only reason he and his family have been given for the authorities' refusal to permit them to leave is that theirs is a `` security'' case <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Isolda </PERSON>, was granted a three-month visa in December to enable her to have surgery for a brain tumor. She remains in <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, after undergoing three operations last month, her husband said Saturday. Jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51,000 in 1979, but dropped after that as U.S.-Soviet relations worsened. In 1986, fewer than 1,000 were allowed to emigrate. The number rose above 8,000 last year for the first time since 1979 but appears to have reached a plateau or declined since the U.S.-Soviet summit in December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some refuseniks blame Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s public annoyance at being questioned repeatedly on the subject Others fear the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has lost some of its persistence in the drive to improve relations and reach a strategic nuclear weapons accord with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. In the meantime, new groups of Jews are forming to press their exit demands. One, calling itself the New Wave, announced it will hold demonstrations every week in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to protest the refusal of Soviet authorities to recognize its members' eligibility for visas because they acknowledge they do n't have immediate relatives abroad. Another group, called the Second Generation, consists of young people whose parents have spent years trying unsuccessfully to leave the country. The children, many now in their teens or 20s, have grown up expecting that one day they would go to the West with their parents but now find they are barred, just as their parents were.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s past has become his present, dredged up endlessly by Democratic presidential rivals who ask whether his evolution on issues from abortion to busing is a troubling lack of conviction. The attacks on <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and his record could seriously damage the Missourian's candidacy if voters come to perceive the six-term congressman as insincere in his beliefs, according to political professionals. `` It's clearly everybody's best shot at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>,'' says Democratic pollster <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Garin </PERSON>. `` What voters are really looking for is somebody who says what he means and means what he says during the election year.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has switched his positions on issues such as abortion and school busing since arriving in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 to represent a blue-collar <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> district. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> explains his changes as a natural evolution of his views and says they are unrelated to the start of his national campaign. But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s Democratic presidential rivals suggest they are flip-flops of political convenience. `` What I try to do in approaching issues is to do it from a practical point of view, to ask what will solve a particular problem,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has said. `` I have strong beliefs about things _ arms control, Central American policy, tax reform, trade, health care, Social Security and what have you _ but I do n't come to those from an ideological viewpoint. I try to look at the facts of a particular issue.'' The attacks against <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> heated up last week during a Democratic debate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> when Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> mentioned several of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s voting zig-zags and said, `` I'm going to lay it on the line, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>. The next president has to be someone who the people will believe will stay with his convictions.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> employed a similar attack strategy against <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s voting record in television commercials aired during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary campaign. The ads asked voters whether they could trust a candidate like <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> who had changed his positions. A <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> poll of 284 Democratic leaders and politicians rated <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> last among the party's seven presidential candidates. The poll, taken on Feb. 17-19 and published this week, asked if the candidates have been `` generally consistent in their stands on issues or not.'' Fifty-eight percent said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had not been consitent, and 38 percent said he had, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll. By contrast, former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who was sixth, was rated as inconsistent by 38 percent and consistent by 49 percent and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was first, received an 86 percent consistent rating and 5 percent inconsistent. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has obviously been wounded by the way that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> basically drew out his record,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Squier </PERSON>, a Democratic political consultant. But <PERSON> Squier </PERSON> contends it will be more difficult and far more expensive for candidates like <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to launch a similar TV offensive against <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in the South because of the large number of states participating in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8. `` I would guess that the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> people feel like they have been through a near miss,'' says <PERSON> Squier </PERSON>. Here are some of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s positions. _ Abortion: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> started his career in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> backing anti-abortion constitutional amendments but dropped his support in 1986, saying there was `` no clear agreement in the country'' on an amendment and that was hurting the chances for resolving the controversial issue He says he continues to oppose federal financing of abortions but has pledged not to veto congressional appropriations of such money if elected president. _ Busing: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> sponsored a constitutional amendment in the 97th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prohibit forced busing of school children for desegregation, a position in line with the views of his mostly white working-class district in south <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> He says he no longer supports such an amendment because `` It's a completely different situation.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the courts are doing something very different which I think is working,'' says <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` Today they use magnet schools, voluntary plans and other methods of trying to get schools integrated, and I think they're much more effective.'' _ Social Security: In 1985, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> joined with conservative southern Democrats in supporting a deficit-cutting package that eliminated cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other federal retirement benefits The proposal was rejected in the House. In his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> says Social Security should be taken out of the budget so it does not become entangled in deficit-reduction fights on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. He also says he would no longer support a freeze on Social Security adjustments. _ Defense: In 1981, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> reversed his long-standing opposition to the MX missile and B-1 bomber and voted for the weapons systems sought by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> In later years, he renewed his opposition. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> says he was wrong in changing his position and did so to give President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a bargaining chip in arms control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> supported former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s proposal for a neutron bomb and in 1982 backed a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> push for production of new chemical weapons. As president, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> says, he would press for a ban on all nerve gas and chemical weapons. He also is supporting a liberal Democratic proposal to ban nuclear tests. _ Taxes: <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, a critic of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies, supported the administration's income tax cut proposal in 1981 He initially voted against the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan because he supported a Democratic alternative. However, he backed the tax cut measure on final passage as did several other Democratic leaders, including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has defended his vote, saying: `` Once we lost, the question was clear _ were we for a tax cut for the middle class or were we not.'' _ Education: In 1981, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> voted for a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> proposal to bar the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from using federal money to block prayer and meditation in public schools <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> says his vote is consistent with his current view that `` you could have voluntary, silent prayer'' in schools. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who campaigns on the need for educational improvements, opposed establishing the Education Department. He also has abandoned his past support of tuition tax credits.

 Leftist guerrillas on Saturday vowed to launch more attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers stationed in the country and claimed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel have become directly involved in combat. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year provided more than $ 600 million in aid to the centrist government fighting an 8-year-old war against Marxist-led insurgents. Most of the aid was military or war-related. Commander <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Roca </PERSON>, a member of the high command of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with the rebel radio station that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel are becoming increasingly involved in combat and repression. He said that makes them more likely to suffer the consequences of insurgent activity. <PERSON> Roca </PERSON>'s statement, broadcast by the rebels' Radio Venceremos, did not appear to be a blanket threat against all Americans in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He referred to the 55 military advisers here training <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> government troops and to what he said was a contingent of `` about 40 -LRB- <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> -RRB- civilians advising and directing the repression of the people's movement.'' `` This kind of personnel is also part of the counterinsurgency campaign and because of that it will find itself increasingly the object of popular combat,'' said <PERSON> Roca </PERSON>. `` For us, the Americans have always been those responsible for this war; they have always sustained the war against the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` Consequently, the personnel they have fighting here is a military objective of our forces.'' He claimed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers stationed at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, 70 southeast of the capital <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, took part in combat there Wednesday. An estimated 600 guerrillas attacked the base and a nearby cotton cooperative in the rebel's biggest assault in 10 months. Eighteen people died in the fighting. Col. <PERSON> Inocente </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, commander of the 6th brigade, said there were four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers at the base when the rebels attacked. He said the compound was never penetrated and that the advisers were never in danger. But he added that `` they were ready, in case of incursion, to help repel the attack.'' Regulations governing the conduct of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers here prohibit them from participation in combat except in self defense. `` To the degree that the war's operation theater is widened, the American advisers, the American personnel in those places ... will find themselves increasingly up against direct military operations,'' said <PERSON> Roca </PERSON>. `` That is to say their -LRB- the American -RRB- military personnel will be going home wounded, dead.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronius </PERSON>, the only military adviser to die in combat here, was killed in March of last year during a guerrilla attack on an army base in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. The rebels assassinated a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer here in 1983 and killed four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> embassy guards, two American businessmen and seven other people in a machine gun attack on a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> cafe in 1985.

 The dean of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> has warned students that anyone involved in racial incidents faces expulsion and other disciplinary measures, but says his comments are general and not provoked by any particular incident. `` In dealing with situations where harassment, discrimination or insensitivity come to light, the college is ready to respond firmly and with appropriate actions,'' Dean <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> said in an open letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> community. `` In cases where physical harassment of students by other members of the community occurs, there is a general principle that the harasser should be asked to leave the community,'' said the letter, published Friday by the student newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimson </ORGANIZATION>. The letter was issued a week after minority students at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> took over a campus building to protest campus racism. The students left the building Wednesday after meeting with the school chancellor. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> said the letter was issued to lay down principles in the wake of deliberations with a committee on racial relations that was set up last year. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and the committee of students and faculty members decided to `` come out with a series of messages that would alert the community to problems that might exist and do exist in some communities,'' <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> said. `` Mine is the first statement.'' Four white students were expelled for a year last fall after frozen fruit was hurled at a black student, who later received several racially derogatory telephone calls. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> said `` we have had no major things'' outside of that incident. The decision to issue the open letter was made later, in December, but its publication was postponed until after exams. The Crimson said questions of racism were raised earlier this month after students alleged that a professor made unspecified disparaging comments about blacks and Indians during a course called `` The Peopling of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the allegations but said no investigation would be made unless a formal complaint was made. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, made up of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s undergraduate institutions, has an enrollment of 6,400.

 The military chief of staff put all troops and police in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area on full alert Saturday to prevent disruption of second anniversary celebrations of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s rise to power. Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said he also placed the alert after the killings of at least six people on <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> streets in the past two weeks, the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Authorities have blamed the ambushes and slayings on communist guerillas. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> also ordered the arrest Saturday of a navy captain linked to the 1986 murder of a leftist labor leader, but the officer refused to leave his home, saying the arrest papers were not in order. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> canceled all military leaves and ordered his troops to intensify patrols and set up nighttime mobilecheckpoints, the agency said. The celebrations next week mark the Feb. 26, 1986 civilian-military coup that placed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power after ousting President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who now lives in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The military said earlier this month that it uncovered plans by communist rebels to step up slayings in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area this year. More than 130 policemen and soldiers were killed in the capital last year. Military field reports reaching <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Saturday said at least six communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were killed and one soldier wounded in clashes Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Surigao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Bukidnon </LOCATION> provinces on the southern island of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, police said they discovered Friday the bodies of five people who they believed were executed by rebels on suspicion of being military informers. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> meanwhile denied involvement in the November 1986 murder of leftist labor leader <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON> and refused to accompany arresting officers because they carried only a photocopy of de Villa's arrest order, <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>' lawyer told reporters. In the order, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> was being arrested `` in connection'' with the slaying of the charismatic chairman of the May 1st Movement, one of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' largest labor federations. Attorney <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcelo </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> challenged the government to present evidence of his involvement.

<TEXT>
 Future peace talks between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and its Contra rebels are likely to have a political hue the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> never wanted The government appeared to open the door to political discussions with its armed opponents by belatedly agreeing in principle last week to a proposal by the mediator of the negotiations, Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That proposal called on the Contras to accept a cease-fire in exchange for four major concessions by the Sandinista government. The concessions were something the Contras had been seeking, and they were quick to accept the cardinal's plan. The government was called upon to grant unrestricted freedom of the press and a total, unconditional amnesty for political prisoners, renew a dialogue with its internal opposition and review its universal military conscription law. Whether it was a tactical error or a considered response, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> delayed in taking a position that President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has long and strenuously opposed. On innumerable occasions in the past, he has said he would never discuss political matters with the Contras. `` We do n't want to create the impression that we do n't want a cease-fire and are being intransigent,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, attorney who advises the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` At all costs, we want the negotiations to go forward.'' <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>'s comments came in a chat with reporters Friday after <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> abruptly suspended the latest round of peace talks a day before they were supposed to end and obliquely blamed the Sandinistas for the breakdown. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Saturday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> that the cardinal's proposal `` was not rejected'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and said his government `` is willing to continue the conversations.'' But a clarification was needed on the withdrawal of the Contras to enclaves during the truce, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said at the close of a government meeting. He repeated that his government is willing to apply an amnesty once a cease-fire is in effect. Referring to the military draft, he said `` it is logical that with the end of the war the military service will not require the current volume -LRB- of soldiers -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told the meeting on new economic measures aimed at fighting inflation that `` enemies of the revolution'' opposed the measures. He said the right, the extreme left and the opposition daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> should be careful not to stir up insurrection. The cardinal said after his return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Saturday that with the suspension of talks, `` We have given time for reflection since there is a lack of trust between the two sides.'' Appearances are of vital importance to both sides, with neither party wanting to be seen as the spoiler as long as there is any remaining chance the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might approve additional military aid for the Contras. In private talks with reporters, the <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> made it clear that they were initially surprised by the cardinal's five-point proposal, then disappointed by his abrupt cancellation of the talks. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, said <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> halted the negotiations Friday afternoon before he had a chance to deliver the government's formal, written response to the proposal the cardinal put forth Thursday. But <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> insisted that he had discussed the government's position at length with the cardinal Friday morning and had not been given any reason to believe that the cardinal was unwilling to continue the negotiations The cardinal `` did not tell us he disagreed'' with the government's position, <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON> told reporters later. In its written response, the government declared its `` agreement in principle'' with the cardinal's proposal, but carefully conditioned its answers to his requests that it reconsider its mandatory draft law and grant an unconditional amnesty to the thousands of political prisoners in Nicaraguan jails. But before <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s formal response was delivered, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> had canceled the talks, saying he was disappointed that both sides had not accepted his proposal, at least in principle. The remark was clearly aimed at the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. But late or not, the government's response clearly put such political matters as press freedom and amnesty on the bargaining table for further talks and, given the opening, the Contras are likely to push for even greater concessions. The cardinal is expected to announce a time and place for a third round of face-to-face negotiations sometime this week. The first round of talks took place in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, in late January, only a week before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s latest request for about $ 43 million in additional Contra aid But the administration is considering a new bid for military aid for the rebels, and as long as that possibility exists, both sides will be playing their cards cautiously at the bargaining table.

 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> employees cheered and uncorked champagne Saturday after news that owner <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> reached agreement with 10 unions to save the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper. `` It has been a nightmare, but thank God, we're still in business,'' said <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pressmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The deal will enable <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> to real estate developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>. It involves a $ 22 million cost-reduction package that fell into place just before 2 a.m. when <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said he would provide $ 3 million to the unions to satisfy the terms of his sale agreement. The unions had already agreed to concessions totaling $ 19 million and said they could not give any more. Cheers, deep sighs and the fizz of champagne filled the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-floor newsroom when the agreement was announced Some employees had worn black to mourn the paper's possible death. `` I feel great,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, head of the drivers' union. `` I feel we salvaged something that at five -LRB- minutes -RRB- of two -LRB- o'clock -RRB- was gone.'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> had set a 2 p.m. Friday deadline for closing the paper, and extended it with time almost out. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> will take over the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for $ 37.6 million on March 7 pending rank-and-file ratification of the concessions and verification by his accountants of the details. His spokesman, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> was considering editorial changes that could tone down the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s brassy style and was committed to keeping the paper operating. `` There will be some changes in the format and appearance of the paper but he's not yet ready to discuss the changes in detail,'' <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. Many of the expected changes come from suggestions by <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> employees. The new owner will meet with union leaders immediately to discuss his plans, <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. `` He wants to assure them he bought the paper so it could continue being a powerful voice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and that he did not buy it for the real estate,'' <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. `` He will try to make it a very <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> paper. `` It seems his whole life now is involved with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He's gone into it with great vigor. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> faces stiff problems in a highly competitive market. The Daily News and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday are also fighting for tabloid readers and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> maintains a strong leadership in advertising revenue. The Post was founded in 1801 by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and other investors and during its long history has come close to folding several times. The latest threat came from a federal law that forced <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to sell the financially troubled tabloid because he also owns a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> television station, <ORGANIZATION> WNYW-TV </ORGANIZATION>. He had said the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> was losing $ 100,000 a day and that he had lost $ 150 million since he bought it in 1976 for $ 31 million. After Saturday's agreement was announced, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said, `` I would do it all again. I ... hate to leave it.'' The $ 22 million package presented to <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> will eliminate 130 of the 1,012 union jobs at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, some immediately and some later over the three-year life of the deal. The paper has about 1,200 employees. `` I do n't think there's any question that without <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s contribution of $ 3 million, the paper would have definitely shut down,'' lawyer and mediator <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON> said `` I would give him the lion's share of the credit.'' The package to keep the Post afloat consists of $ 22 million in lost jobs and pay cuts and $ 3 million from <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to restore the pay cuts. Because of that contribution, no paycheck will be smaller for the employees who remain. <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> referred to the $ 3 million he put into the settlement as his farewell gift to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and its employees.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Saturday that the right, the extreme left and the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> should `` be careful, because they can in fact provoke an insurrection that can destroy them.'' Speaking at the closing of the leftist government's meeting on new economic measures, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said `` enemies of the revolution,'' including the political opposition, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, opposed new economic steps announced by his administration the past week. He called La Prensa `` the daily of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The opposition from both sides of the political spectrum and the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said, `` have said that the time for an insurrection has come.'' He said they should not `` be looking for five feet on the cat because they may find them. They should be careful, because if they put themselves on the side of the Contras and the aggressors they are going to stir winds that can provoke tempests.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> is the most important private business organization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Adding more teeth to the economic measures announced earlier, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced one - to four-year prison sentences for speculators He said taxi drivers and others who work in transportation would have their vehicles confiscated if they charged more than the official prices. He also announced a 10 percent reduction in the national budget and a tax exemption for 22,900 families whose housing loans were forgiven by the government. The exact amount of the budget is not known and he did not elaborate on where the cuts would be made. Those and other measures announced the past week are `` to give the economy a push and fight inflation,'' he said. The Sandinista government on Monday created a new cordoba currency worth 1,000 times as much as the old one and pegged it at 10 to the dollar. It also raised salaries to five times what they were in December and authorized price increases of up to more than 50 percent on some basic goods. Although the measures were designed to slow inflation, which was 1,500 percent for 1987, prices already were being hiked beyond the new official levels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> issued a decree that requires individuals and corporations to report any foreign currency holdings of more than $ 500. A stamped, signed copy of a report of the holdings to one of the country's banks will be legal authorization for the owner to keep the money, said the decree issued Friday. Reports must be filed within 15 days but are not required if the funds are deposited in state-owned banks. Failure to follow the rules will be considered a currency violation, punishable by one to three years in prison under a 1981 law. Another decree authorizes the government's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to investigate large deposits of old cordobas if there are suspected of being linked to illegal activity. Groups from <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, civilian neighborhood organizations, accompanied by police, have raided storerooms of alleged black market businesses and public markets to confiscate goods and force vendors to sell at official prices. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> compared the economic measures to `` a strong medicine'' for a sick person. `` As long as the war does n't end, we are going to try to have the patient recover to better confront the aggressor,'' he said. The Contra rebels, which have been supported by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, have been fighting more than six years to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.

 A woman pleaded innocent Saturday to a charge that she killed one of her five former husbands, who died two years ago of arsenic poisoning, but she remained in jail in lieu of $ 200,000 bond, authorities said. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 54, was arrested Friday and charged with first-degree murder in the 1986 death of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON>. `` My client is in disbelief about the whole thing,'' attorney <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cates </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> woman, who now has a sixth husband, is `` not wealthy'' and was having trouble coming up with the bond, Mrs. <PERSON> Cates </PERSON> said. Her husband `` is standing beside her,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cates </PERSON>, who did not know his name. Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was widowed by two of her husbands and was divorced from the other three, Mrs. <PERSON> Cates </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> entered her innocent plea before Associate Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, who informed her she could face a minimum of 20 years and a maximum of 40 years if convicted. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION>, died March 8, 1986, at Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, and the initial autopsy showed he had died from arsenic poisoning, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocis </PERSON>. `` It's unusual for a case to be charged two years after the offense,'' <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> said. `` But we did n't feel we had enough evidence to present to a jury until now. `` We had some problems, and all the questions about them will be answered at the trial. We'd rather not discuss them until the trial.'' `` In an in-depth investigation like this, there are obviously no witnesses to the crime. We have to rule out all accidental causes, so it takes a long time,'' <PERSON> Kocis </PERSON> said. He said the death of the other man who died while being married to Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was not currently under investigation, but he refused to say whether it had ever been investigated. He said he did not know the man's name or when he died. `` The investigation is concentrated on -LRB- <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>'s -RRB- death at this particular time,'' <PERSON> Kocis </PERSON> said.

 A flash rainstorm caused floods and mudslides that left at least 70 people dead Saturday. As many as 95 others were feared dead after an avalanche of mud and boulders crashed into a nursing home. Firemen used surfboards and the navy used amphibious vehicles to rescue people stranded by the storm, which began late Friday night and left about 3,150 homeless. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Noronha </PERSON> said at least 70 died and 80 to 95 more were feared dead. The same number of victims was reported by <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, who said the death toll could be even higher because of mudslides in poor shantytowns that line mountainsides in this city of 5.6 million. The four-hour downpour dumped 4.88 inches on <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> and left many streets under 5 feet of water. Mayor <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Saturnino </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> declared the city a disaster area, called in all off-duty municipal doctors and canceled a post-Carnival Parade of Champions scheduled for Saturday night. `` There is nothing to celebrate now. There is only sorrow,'' said <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>, a popular samba composer who performed in the famous Carnival festivities here a week ago. The Vila Isabel neighborhood, whose samba school won this year's top Carnival prize and which celebrated Wednesday with an all-night victory party, was one of the most rain-battered zones in the city State troopers were sent out to prevent the looting of stores and stop holdups of drivers whose cars had broken down in the high water. <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said most of the 70 deaths occurred in poor slum areas, where housing is precarious and drains and sewers often nonexistent. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a rescue work coordinator in the mayor's office, said: `` We are accustomed to tragedies in our slums, but this was too much. Something definitely must be done to protect slum people from rainstorms.'' A mudslide knocked down one three-story wing of the three-wing <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genoveva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a Social Security nursing home in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION>, a well-to-do mountainside neighborhood. There was little hope that the estimated 80 to 95 elderly patients there would get out alive. `` There is so much wood and concrete there we do n't believe anybody could survive,'' <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> said. At sundown the rescue efforts were called off for the day. `` It was awful. All my friends were dead in an instant,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Teixeira </PERSON>, one of 350 patients evacuated from the two other wings of the hospital, told a TV interviewer as she lay in a stretcher. Boulders and mud left by the storm held up rescuers for three hours on their way to the nursing home. `` Old people were left standing in the rain and chill all that time. I do n't know how they endured it,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The storm, accompanied by near nonstop thunder and lightning, knocked out telephones and international communications and stopped commuter trains. Even the fire department and Civil Defense were without phones for a while and had to rely on radio to coordinate rescue work. Earlier this month, rain caused flooding and mudslides that killed about 206 people and drove 13,000 from their homes in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state. The hardest-hit spot then was <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>, a mountain resort 40 miles north of the city of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A court Saturday ordered the extradition of a prominent <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> activist to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, citing a separate case, welcomed limits on extraditions to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carron </PERSON>, 34, a former member of the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and a leading member of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, had been sought since he jumped bail on a weapons charge in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> two years ago. Police arrested him Friday night in the southwestern county of <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> border, after an officer recognized him. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> ordered <PERSON> Carron </PERSON> extradited to British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> but gave him 15 days to appeal the order. The court ordered that he remain in custody pending appeal. In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said Saturday that a British court's refusal to free six Irishmen accused of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings showed the need for restrictions on the extradition of terrorist suspects to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> inserted new conditions Dec. 1 for extradition to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The measures include the requirements that British authorities produce evidence on warrants in all extradition cases, and that the Irish attorney general approve all extraditions. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a `` historic inability ... to comprehend Irish feelings and sensitivities,'' <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said in a speech to the annual conference of the governing Fianna Fail party. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> long has criticized the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s reluctance to extradite suspects sought for trial in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> actions. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with mainly Roman Catholic Ireland. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said the need for restrictions was exemplified by the case of six Irishmen sentenced to life in prison for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s bombings of two <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> pubs in 1974 that killed 21 people. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Court of Appeal upheld their convictions last month, rejecting arguments that new evidence undermined the confessions and forensic findings that sent them to prison. `` The wisdom of, and the necessity for, the effective safeguards provided in our extradition legislation has been clearly confirmed,'' <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said. `` These safeguards are now in place and it is on the basis of these safeguards, or not at all, that extradition will proceed.'' <PERSON> Carron </PERSON>'s case was not affected by the legislation because warrants seeking his extradition were issued in November, before introduction of the new regulations. <PERSON> Carron </PERSON> came to prominence in 1981 when he was the election officer for <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, who launched a seven-month <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> hunger strike at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Maze Prison that year. Sands, who was elected to the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> while behind bars, and nine other <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members starved themselves to death during the protest over prison regulations. When Sands died, <PERSON> Carron </PERSON> won his parliamentary seat. The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, had been hunting <PERSON> Carron </PERSON> since he jumped bail in January 1986 on a charge of possessing a soldier's rifle. He had been released on bail to run as a <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> candidate in special elections to the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. After being defeated in the election, <PERSON> Carron </PERSON> failed to report back to jail.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ An opposition leader who led two unsuccessful invasions during the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship left the country Saturday after spending six months holed up in an embassy, said <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON>, who was granted political asylum by the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> after the Haitian government accused him of urging peasants to revolt, boarded an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight bound for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> at 5 p.m., the independent radio station said. <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was driven to the airport in an <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> limousine, accompanied by four carloads of Haitian soldiers, the radio said. President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, in an address on state television Friday night, promised safe conduct `` for all of those in political asylum.'' <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON>, in his mid-40s, was the only person known to have been in political asylum in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. He was accused Aug. 3 last year of attempting to provoke a revolution in <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON>, his hometown, on the tip of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s southwestern peninsula After a shootout with soldiers, he and several supporters fled into the surrounding hills and disappeared for three weeks. The military claimed he arrived with a group of armed men and distributed weapons to peasants in the town. <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON> denied the charges. <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON> said in a radio address from the Argentine Embassy on Aug. 25 that he had been armed only with a revolver, for which he claimed to have a license. He said he went to <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON> to attend a trial of people accused of taking part in a massacre in 1964. <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON> said hundreds of upper class mulatto families and suspected opponents of dictator <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> were massacred by soldiers and the <ORGANIZATION> Tontons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s secret police. The government has never acknowledged the killings. <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON>, whose entire family was slain in the massacre, said the army wanted to kill him since his testimony would have implicated high ranking officers, including Defense Minister <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Regala </PERSON>, a reserve army brigidier general and former member of the military-run junta. <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON>, who at one time owned a gas station in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, led foiled invasions in 1963 and 1982 during the 29-year dictatorship of <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>. He lived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from the early 1960s until 1986, when <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The 1963 invasion occurred in <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON>. He escaped, but 12 colleagues were captured and shot by a military firing squad. In 1982, he landed on the island of La Tortue on <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s northern coast. Eight people died in the 1982 invasion and <PERSON> Sansaricq </PERSON> and others were rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.

 A black teen-ager sent to death row at age 15 was convicted Saturday of murder in a retrial brought after the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned his original conviction by an all-white jury. The prosecutor said he would not seek the death penalty again. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 18, showed no emotion and even smiled faintly at the jurors as they filed out of the courtroom. The <ORGANIZATION> Crittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated nearly 13 hours over two days before finding him guilty in the 1985 deaths of three whites. Though he was convicted of capital murder, Prosecuting Attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said he would not ask the jury to impose the death penalty. As a result, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was automatically given life in prison without parole, the only other possible sentence for capital felony murder. `` The fact that he has been on death row for 2 -LCB- years was a factor in the decision,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. He also said he considered the length of time the jury spent in deliberations. `` I felt like I could not call upon this jury to do more than they've done.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said a notice of appeal would be filed immediately.

The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned the original conviction last year, noting that an all-white jury convicted the 15-year-old black boy of killing the three whites. The retrial jury had eight whites and four blacks. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was convicted of killing <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, 76; <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, 72; and a seventh-grade classmate of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s, 12-year-old <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who was the grandnephew of the two women.

 Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have asked a judge to have Coretta Scott King release tapes of conversations between her late husband, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and others, recorded secretly by federal investigators. The motion, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, also asks for correspondence between King and his colleagues. The action, which Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s attorneys charged was a form of harassment, was the latest round in the legal fight between the school and Mrs. King over an estimated 83,000 documents involving her husband which are now held by <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>. King, who had earned a graduate degree from the School of Theology in 1955, donated the papers to the university in 1964. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> has filed suit, saying the documents should be in the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and contending the university had mishandled or lost some of the papers <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> trustees decided unanimously to oppose the suit. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s attorneys said they would oppose the request for copies of the secretly recorded tapes. `` It seems they're inquiring into things, including Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s personal life and perhaps Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s, that have nothing to do with this case,'' said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, one of Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` We are going to object to the request for tapes,'' he said. `` I think it's harassment.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who also represents Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> in the suit, said they did not believe Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> had copies of the tapes. `` I do n't know at the moment if Mrs. King, or the estate, has that information. I would doubt it,'' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Published reports in the 1970s indicated that a package of the tapes was sent anonymously to Mrs. King. Beginning in 1964, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bugged hotel rooms where King was staying. Tapes implicating King in alleged extramarital sexual activity were made available to reporters, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and then-President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. In 1977, a federal judge ordered the tapes sealed for 50 years. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> trustee who law firm is handling the suit for the university, said he believed Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> had some of the tapes. `` Of course she has some of them,'' he said. He refused to say why the university wanted copies of the tapes for the lawsuit. `` We are entitled to seek documents we believe will be admissible evidence in this case,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` Whatever we ask for we believe will further our position.'' `` We could make an argument for its appropriatenesss in a court of law,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` If you think we're going to discuss the strategy of our case in the press _ that's a bit much.''

 Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials failed to reach agreement on opening some Japanese construction projects to American firms, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> recently offered to allow foreign participation in six large public works projects, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday the proposals were not enough. The officials held an unusual weekend news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, but spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Farren </PERSON>, deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade, is heading the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. The six projects are expansion of the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Haneda </LOCATION>, construction of a new airport in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, a bridge across the <PERSON> Akashi </PERSON> strait near <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, a highway along Ise Bay, the development of a coastal area along the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and work at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>. `` A great many American firms have expressed tremendous interest in gaining access to Japanese markets,'' said one official. `` But the kind of things we called for in the way of construction services on this list would only open door to a very narrow range of American construction firms. `` We've come to a judgement that the list -LRB- of the six projects -RRB- is not sufficient'' he said. The officials said the talks will probably continue in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders on an official visit last month. Access to the Japanese construction market has been a major trade issue in recent years between the two countries. Japanese companies won about $ 2.3 billion in contracts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms did about $ 500 million in business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to construction officials. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has opened only two semi-public projects to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> builders _ the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> bridge and the multi-billion dollar <ORGANIZATION> Kansai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> project. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year passed legislation prohibiting foreign companies from taking part in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public works projects for one year if their countries bar participation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms in their public works projects.

 World champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> lost Saturday in the quarterfinals of the world chess blitz championship, but Soviet colleague <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> won the sport's richest tournament ever `` I played badly as you saw,'' said <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, 24, of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He spoke briefly to reporters after his morning loss to Bulgarian <PERSON> Kirel </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgiev </PERSON>, 22. Tal, 51, who won his first major Soviet competition in 1957 and the world championship in 1960, defeated Soviet <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaganian </PERSON> 3.5-0 .5 Vaganian, 37, had defeated <PERSON> Georgiev </PERSON> in the semifinals. The blitz match is a fast-paced chess game in which each player has only five minutes' playing time. The results do not count in competition for the world chess title. In the six-game final, Tal stormed to a 3-0 lead before agreeing to a draw in the fourth game to seize the title. Tal, ranked No. 6 in the world, told reporters that he never expected to win and said `` my opponents played too hospitably.'' `` It's the beginning of a second career for Tal,'' said American grandmaster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. In 1960, Tal, then 23, became the youngest world champion in history until <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> gained the title in 1985 at age 22. But Tal lost his title in 1961 to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Botvinnik </PERSON>, another Soviet. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s debacle began in the first of a four-game series where he had a queen, a bishop and a king verses <PERSON> Goeirgive </PERSON>'s lone king, a position where many beginners would have little difficulty in winning. But <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, the tournament favorite, stunned the audience by stalemating his opponent, ending the game in a draw. In the position, <PERSON> Georgiev </PERSON>'s king could not move, but unlike a checkmate, it was not attacked. As <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> made the hideous error, there were gasps from spectators and he held his head in his hands. In the second game, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> pressed too hard for victory, blundered and lost. Their third encounter was drawn and <PERSON> Georgiev </PERSON> checkmated the world champion in the fourth as <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> overreached, desperately searching for a victory. The championship offered a total prize fund of 75,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. Tal won $ 37,500 for four hours work, the highest prize ever offered for a single chess tournament. On Friday, former world champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, ranked No. 2 in the world, was eliminated from the blitz competition. The blitz championship ended the monthlong World Chess Festival in the port city on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s east coast.

 Passengers aboard <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Zephyr complained that they received no warnings or instructions from crew members when a smoky fire caused by a defective heater in a crew car killed one man early Saturday and injured 19 people. `` It's a miracle that there was n't some kind of panic,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, a passenger in the first coach car behind the passenger sleeper, which was coupled to the crew car. `` I think the worst thing was that they did n't let anyone in our car know whether we were in danger. We could n't find out if our car was safe.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the fire aboard the 14-car westbound train carrying 294 passengers and a crew of 18 was reported about 3 a.m. as the train was pulling into <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> for a scheduled stop. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> Fire Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitera </PERSON> said the blaze was under control about 90 minutes later. An electrical short in the wiring of the crew car heating unit caused the fire, Deputy State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said at an afternoon news conference. He said the heater was in a storage area under the crew sleeping quarters and that the short ignited the car's wood floor. State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said the wiring showed wear and tear but did not say <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> was negligent. <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderberg </PERSON> said an autopsy showed that the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> employee died of smoke inhalation. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> investigators, who did not attend the news conference, were on the scene by late Saturday morning. The crew car and the passenger sleeper were disconnected from the Zephyr, which travels from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, then splits into sections that proceed to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The rest of the train pulled out of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> about 9:30 a.m. after some crew members were checked at the hospital and returned, he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, and 11-year-old grandson <PERSON> Robby </PERSON> were in a deluxe sleeper en route to a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ski trip. He said they opened the compartment door and found the hallway filled with smoke. `` We just woke up and smelled smoke,'' said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, who suffers from asthma, was admitted to the hospital for observation, her husband said `` The thing I ca n't understand is we heard no smoke detectors going off,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said there are no smoke detectors on the train because `` no one has invented one that works reliably.'' Because smoke detectors are so sensitive, the constant vibrations of trains would set them off, he said. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said he could recall only two train fires and that because they are so rare there has not been a market for smoke detectors designed for trains. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the rest of the train was not in any danger from the fire, and that there is no fuel or propane in any of the passenger cars. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> and another passenger, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Casuscelli </PERSON>, also of Fremont, said no crew members told them to evacuate, but they and a number of other passengers decided to leave the train after seeing fire trucks arrive. Some crew members and passengers from the sleeping cars milled around outside the train, many of the men shirtless or wearing only long underwear. `` Normally, you do n't want passengers to get off as long as the rest of the train is not in danger,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. `` It is safer to keep people on the train.'' A female crew member ran through <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>'s car, asking passengers for blankets for the injured. She said the woman's face was covered with soot and she was shoeless. The crew car is designed for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> service attendants who are with the train from the beginning to the end of the trip. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said it was divided into two sections, one for baggage and one with small bedrooms. The victim, identified as chef <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguelles </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, was one of seven crew members on the car, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. Nine crew members and three passengers remained Saturday evening in <LOCATION> Mary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanning </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where they were being treated for smoke inhalation, <PERSON> Anderberg </PERSON> said. All were listed in satisfactory or good condition. Three crew members, one passenger, two policemen and an ambulance attendant were treated and released, <PERSON> Anderberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a town of about 18,000, is in south-central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>.

 Supporters of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Saturday accused <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of running a television advertisement that distorts the governor's views on agriculture The ad, which first aired across the state Friday night, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would not take a stand on a family farm bill sponsored by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and ended with a barb at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' much-criticized suggestion that <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers consider raising Belgian endive, a salad green. At a news conference, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, who supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the Democratic nomination for president, said the governor's farm plan would work well for Midwestern states. Although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised Massachussetts farmers's efforts to diversify by raising endive, he recognizes that nationally, `` we need a fair price in the marketplace, and supply management,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. But after the news conference, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> campaign issued a statement contending <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has repeatedly denounced supply management for farmers.'' The statement included a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> article quoting the governor as saying that controlling production would be `` incredibly complicated and very bureaucratic.'' But, state Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duxbury </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wessington </LOCATION>, a state co-chairman for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said, `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has laid out a very thoughtful agriculture policy for family farmers and ranchers.

State Sen. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellips </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alcester </LOCATION>, another state co-chairman, called the ads `` a new low in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> presidential politics'' and urged their removal.

 A brain-dead baby whose body was kept alive in hopes of tranplanting his organs was removed from life-support machines Saturday after no suitable recipient could be found, officials said. Meanwhile, a child born Saturday with the same fatal defect in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was placed on a respirator and flown to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to be enrolled in <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s donor program The babies were born without most of their brain and skull, a fatal condition known as anencephaly. The child known as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> was born Tuesday and declared brain-dead Thursday at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>. Officials had hoped to keep the baby's body on life-support machines for up to seven days, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. By Saturday, Ms. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said, `` Physicians of four waiting liver recipients of Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s same blood type refused the liver because of its progressive deterioration over the past 36 hours. `` Despite a worldwide search, no infant of the same blood type needing a heart has been found. `` Out of respect for the brain-dead infant and with the consent of his mother, Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> removed the artificial life support from <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> and his cardiac activity ceased at 2:15 p.m.'' Anencephaly is fatal, usually within days after birth. An infant's healthy organs can only be transplanted if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infant on life-support from birth. The first anencephalic child considered by <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> hospital for the pioneering procedure was the child of <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. But the baby was stillborn on Dec. 22. The use of such infants as organ donors has raised controversial ethical issues, and <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> is the first hospital in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to develop a medical protocol allowing such transplants. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has denounced the procedure and complained that doctors have failed to do enough to ensure that organs were n't removed from live children. One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year from a donor child in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. If the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> baby is declared dead within seven days, and one or more of her organs successfully transplanted, it would be the first time that the procedure has been tried using an anencephalic baby born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The infant, 6-pound, 1-ounce <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON> was put on a chartered plane in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>. She was born with only a brain stem, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNaughton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> is the first child of Airman First Class <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Keys </PERSON>, 21, and his wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, 22.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> was the favorite among <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republicans while Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was the leader among Democrats surveyed in the latest <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Poll. The poll results, published in the Sunday editions of the Star Tribune, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> received support from 42 percent of the Republicans surveyed while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favored by 32 percent. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was third with 11 percent and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was favored by 5 percent. Ten percent gave other responses. Among Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored by 29 percent, followed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> at 18 percent. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was third with 14 percent, followed by former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> at 11 percent and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 9 percent. Nineteen percent gave other responses. The poll of 800 adults randomly selected statewide from households that have telephones was taken Feb. 10-14, or about 10 days before the state's precinct caucuses. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, the newspaper said. The newspaper said the poll makes no attempt to predict how candidates will perform in the precinct caucuses because the survey was not confined to those likely to attend precinct caucuses. A Simon statement issued by his <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> campaign office said, `` There's no way any poll can get a realistic picture of how active, independent-minded -LRB- Democrats -RRB- will divide Tuesday night.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> finished second in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, which were won by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, and came in third in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came in first and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was second. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses while <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> finished a surprising second ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who bounced back to win the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> finished third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The Minnesota Poll found that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> are stronger with middle-aged and older <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> adults, while <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> find more of their support with younger adults.

 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s last stop on his way home from 18 months of campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination was to tell a cheering crowd at his national campaign headquarters Saturday that it was good to be home. `` I got a call a week ago from a neighbor of mine who said, ` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, you may be hot stuff out there in the rest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, running for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, debating on television all the time, but you better get home because you're fence is falling down and the dog is wreckin' my lawn,''' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> told about 1,000 of his supporters <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, the former governor of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, officially dropped out of the race Thursday after disappointing showings in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he and his wife, <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>, were going to spend some time getting reacquainted and re-establishing their roots in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` I want you to know one thing: wherever we go, our roots will always be in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, he said.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he would be jumping into the fray of the gubernatorial recall election, but not as a candidate. `` I want to take the time in the next month or two to try and get back into the swing of what it is that's going on here, to rejoin our fight here in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, introduced to the crowd by acting Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who has replaced impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, said, `` I'm going to join you in whatever way I can to make sure the change is permanent.'' He said he has been asked about his future plans and that he has n't ruled out anything except running for governor of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, adding that there were plenty of good candidates. `` It's all of you that gave me this opportunity. It was a great run. I hope that I come back having reflected the spirit of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, our traditions, honor, on all of us. I'm glad to be home. Thanks very much,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. Asked what he had learned from 18 months of campaigning, said: `` I think most of all, a tremendous sense of faith and confidence in the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's an incredibly diverse country, full of people just bursting with energy, with optimism, who are really thirsting for some leadership ... 1988 is going to be important, because we will have a transition, and we've somehow got to capture a spirit of challenge, of truth-telling, of a kind of willingness to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the truth and get this economy moving.''

<HEAD>Soviet Cosmonauts Will Carry U.S. Commercial Project Into Space</HEAD>

 Soviet cosmonauts will carry a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial project into space for the first time in a deal approved by the government, an attorney for the project said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Payload </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wellsley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, received a two-year license from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month to contract with the Soviet space agency to perform protein crystallization experiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who handled the company's negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments The company, a consulting firm, was founded in 1984 by <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachussetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. He was the first American non-astronaut to fly aboard the space shuttle in December 1983. The experiment will use the weightlessness of space to grow large, regular protein crystals, which are useful in the development of new drugs, <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said Saturday evening. `` To my knowledge, it is the first time that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has approved commercial activity in the Soviet space program. Certainly we've had joint missions, government-to-government,'' he said. Since the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in January 1986, American companies have been left with few alternatives for space projects. `` Even when the shuttle was flying it provided only a limited amount of time in space. With the shuttle down, the only American option is -LRB- a plane -RRB- flown in a parabolic flight path that gives only a few minutes of weightlessness,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were concerned about the possibility of transferring sensitive technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said, `` We created a situation that absolutely minimized that.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued the license after getting from the Pentagon. `` There will be extremely limited training given to the cosmonauts. They will be doing no more than turning some dials on a box, the contents of which they will not know about, and monitoring environmental conditions in the space station,'' he said. He said the Soviets were satisfied with the arrangement, adding, `` Their goal from what I could tell is to promote commercial uses worldwide of their station.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been reluctant to permit <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies to hire the Soviets to launch satellites and <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said the Soviets viewed the crystallization project as their best shot at working with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm. He said Payload Systems has reached an agreement in principle with the Soviets, but still was negotiating over details. He said the company would not attempt to sell the crystals grown in the first flight. `` They're just trying to see if it works for commercial purposes,'' he said. According to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which carried a story on the project in Sunday's editions, the first flight will be sometime next year. The newspaper said Payload Systems refused to discuss the terms of the contract. It added, however, that the Soviets in the past have offered to carry Western experiments for between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 a kilogram. Calls to company officials seeking comment were not immediately returned Saturday night. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget, released Thursday, provides $ 1 billion to build a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station by the mid-1990s. Earlier this month <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> unveiled a national policy for commercial activity in space. It provides for the government to lease space aboard a space module that will be carried aloft by the space shuttle and left in orbit.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Announce First Transport Ban of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas said Friday they will shut down road and highway transport nationwide next week as part of their protest against the government's election plans. The 24-hour transport ban, set to begin at 12:01 a.m. Monday, is the first scheduled by the rebels this year. The announcement, made on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the action was part of the guerrilla campaign against legislative and municipal elections scheduled for March 20. The traffic bans have been effective in the past, especially in the war-torn east. Motorists stay off the roads, fearing reprisal by the guerrillas. Also Friday, the armed forces said five guerrillas and two soldiers died in combat near the town of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION>, 55 miles north of the capital. Six government soldiers were wounded, they said. Radio Venceremos claimed guerrilla forces inflicted 23 casualties on government troops in Thursday's clash at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION>. It did not distinguish between dead and wounded and did not report rebel losses. In another attack, rebels assaulted the local Civil Defense headquarters, the mayor's office and the telephone office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jorge </LOCATION> before dawn Friday, according to sources in the town 95 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The sources, reached by telephone, said five Civil Defense militiamen were killed and two wounded. They had no information on guerrilla casualties. The guerrillas caused extensive damage, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anoymity. Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have pursued a steady campaign of economic sabotage as part of their 8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government. In addition to the regular declaration of traffic bans, the campaign includes the blowing up of utility poles, attacks on power stations and raids on farms and warehouses containing coffee, cotton and sugar _ the country's main export crops. There were seven guerrilla-imposed transport strikes last year. Three violators of the strike were killed, about 30 were wounded and 160 vehicles were destroyed or damaged. The insurgents on Wednesday carried out their biggest attack of the year, assaulting the base of the 6th infantry brigade and a cotton cooperative in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, 70 miles east of the capital. The rebel radio said the assault marked the beginning of a campaign designated `` armed struggle is the alternative to the new electoral farce.'' Leftist parties have not participated in elections held during the war, saying that their candidates' safety could not be guaranteed.

<TEXT>
 Thai and Laotian forces began a truce in a disputed border area Friday, pulling back from the hilly ground where hundreds of comrades had been killed since November, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officers said. After the cease-fire began at 8 a.m., two parallel rows of <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> flags were planted to mark a zone two miles deep that soldiers are forbidden to cross, said the army chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Charuay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wongsayant </PERSON>. Military officials of both sides agreed to the cease-fire Wednesday after two days of talks in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The disputed area is about 240 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s northern province of <LOCATION> Phitsanulok </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sayaboury </LOCATION> province in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Rithee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rungkaputi </PERSON>, chief of civilian affairs for the 3rd Army Region, said a half-hour skirmish occurred on a contested hill an hour before the truce began, with no casualties. He said it there probably was a delay in commmunicating the cease-fire order. <PERSON> Rithee </PERSON> also reported a heavy artillery exchange and two ground battles Wednesday and Thursday, while military teams from the two countries were meeting in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> told reporters Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials had been sent to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> seeking help in resolving the problem. Both sides claim the area on the basis of recognized maps and a 1907 French-Thai treaty. The official Laotian news agency <ORGANIZATION> KPL </ORGANIZATION> quoted Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Thonglay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kommasith </PERSON>, deputy head of the army's general political department, as saying the talks in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> `` paved the way toward negotiations, a diplomatic channel to solve the <LOCATION> Lao-Thai </LOCATION> border problem.'' <PERSON> Thonglay </PERSON> participated in the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> meeting. The dispatch said he spoke at a news conference Thursday in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. The agreement calls for the governments to hold talks within 15 days after the truce begins to determine the frontier line.

<HEAD>Thatcher Announces Civil Service Restructuring Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has announced plans to shift 70,000 of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 580,000 civil servants out of government ministries and into a dozen new agencies run by private-industry-style executives. The new agencies will take over such duties as issuing passports and drivers' licenses, forecasting the weather and printing government documents. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that `` in general'' the new agencies planned in the next 12 months will stay part of the civil service, accountable to the government and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. But she indicated some may eventually become private companies, saying: `` Insofar as they become totally outside the civil service they will not, of course, be accountable'' to government scrutiny. She did not elaborate but said the 12 were `` the first suitable candidates,'' indicating more changes are in the pipeline. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the plans herald the biggest civil service shake-up this century. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said the government aims to eventually separate the civil servants responsible for carrying out executive functions from the minority responsible for formulating policy. The possibility of some of the new agencies eventually being turned into private companies drew criticism from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Some civil service trade unions also attacked the restructuring plans, saying the changes could lead to a decline in pay and working conditions for their members. The government has said its aim is increased efficiency. The 12 new agencies will take control of 12 services currently run by central government departments. They include: _ Issuing passports, currently one of the jobs of the Home Office. _ Running the government stationery office which prints government documents. That is currently one of the jobs of the office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. _ Running the meteorological office, which provides weather forecasts for the armed forces, television and radio, farmers and other clients and is presently run by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. _ Managing the royal parks in and around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, now done by the Department of the Environment. _ Issuing driving permits, one of the jobs of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>. The plans announced by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> follow a report by her Efficiency Unit headed by Sir <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibbs </PERSON>, an executive of the industrial chemicals group <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. It called for agencies run by executives, not ministers, to take over the day-to-day executive functions of government. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to power in 1979 pledged to cut back the growth of big government. Her Conservative administration has followed a program of selling off state-owned companies to private owners.

 Millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> began serving part of a sentence for tax evasion Friday by handing out rolls at a soup kitchen. `` He's being introduced to everybody on a first-name basis,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Camillus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a shelter for the needy. The 69-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> tycoon, who declined requests for interviews, was received `` in just the same way as any other person who comes here to work as a volunteer, although I realize he's not a volunteer,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> last week sentenced <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to work 5,000 hours of community service over five years. He also must pay $ 3 million to help the homeless and $ 4 million in back taxes, penalties and interest. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> had faced up to 40 years in prison after pleading no contest last Sept. 29 to evading more than $ 1.2 million in federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible college as a tax exemption. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, whose net worth was estimated at $ 240 million in 1984 by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, will work one day a week for the next eight weeks at the downtown shelter. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, accompanied by his attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, began his five-hour shift by taking a tour of the shelter and meeting other workers. He worked at an entrance gate, admitting people to the cafeteria and making sure it did not exceed its capacity of about 100. When several news photographers tried to take his picture, <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> went inside to serve rolls to people coming through the food line, which serves 700 to 900 needy people each day. Several of the men who went through the food line said they knew about <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s background and found him to be friendly. `` He shook hands with me. He's a very nice guy,'' said <PERSON> Brote </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` I said, ` Come on, papa, shake my hand. I'd like to shake a millionaire's hand.''' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, wearing a white shirt and clear plastic gloves, chatted with other workers as he handed out rolls. The meal also included hot chicken, string beans and rice.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> proposed Friday that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and five Western <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries take part in efforts to verify compliance with a Central American peace plan. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> told a news conference that foreign observers would form permanent mobile units in each of the five countries covered by the peace plan. The mobile units, he said, would be in place for a year and be allowed to make on-site inspections without prior notice to ensure the countries were meeting terms of the agreement. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> suggested that representatives from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> be members of the verification panel. The countries, he said, `` have shown their willingness to take part in this type of activity in order to achieve and guarantee peace in Central America.'' The presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> signed the peace plan last Aug. 7. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said he offered the proposal at a verification meeting of the Central American foreign ministers Wednesday. The officials met for 10 hours in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but failed to agree on ways to determine compliance with the peace plan. They called for further talks in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> by March 15. The peace plan calls for cease-fire negotiations between governments and insurgents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a first step toward democratic elections. It also calls for political amnesties and a ban on all outside military assistance to rebel groups.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> denied in a strongly worded protest note that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> allows its territory to be used by leftist rebels to threaten the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` The government of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in no case allows the use of Mexican territory by the groups of the FMLN-FDR -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to develop activities that have repercussions and attempt against the stability of the Salvadoran government,'' <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> said in a note to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The note, released Thursday afternoon, was in response to a protest note <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> sent to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> earlier in the week. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> links five guerrilla groups that have been fighting <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s U.S.-supported government for the past eight years. The FDR is its political ally. The groups' joint political-diplomatic commission maintains an office in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, as does clandestine rebel <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> said the office is allowed because Mexican law establishes `` protection for political exiles who enter national territory and the constitution guarantees for all people who are in the territory liberty of association, transit and expression of ideas.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> decided to make his response public because the Salvadoran government released its note to the press. `` That goes out of normal diplomatic channels,'' the source said. Relations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were tense in the early years of the Salvadoran civil war, especially after then-President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> recognized the rebels as a legitimate political force in a joint Mexican-French declaration in 1981.

 One of four leaders of the extreme left group <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> who have been refusing food for 81 days was acquitted Friday night on charges of attempted murder. <PERSON> Nathalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON> and the other two defendants in the case, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleicher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailhac </PERSON>, were found innocent by the special <ORGANIZATION> Assizes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court, which has judges serving as the jury, was established last year for terrorism cases. The three were accused in the January 1982 shooting of <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpentier </PERSON>, then a leader of a squatters movement in eastern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carpentier </PERSON> testified Friday that he did not know the three defendants, and said police had tried to get him to say the Direct Action members were his assailants. `` I do n't understand what you want of them,'' <PERSON> Carpentier </PERSON> said. `` I'm the victim, and I can tell you they had nothing to do with this affair.'' Police investigators told the court they considered the defendants suspects after questioning <PERSON> Carpentier </PERSON>'s friends and family. Prosecutor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barreyre </PERSON> said in his closing argument that the shooting was part of Direct Action's effort to gain control of the squatters movement. He asked for 15-year sentences for each of the three defendants. Ms. <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON> and three other Direct Action leaders, <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipriani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouillan </PERSON>, have been on a hunger strike since Dec. 1, demanding an end to their solitary confinement. They are being fed intravenously against their will. All four were convicted Feb. 12 in a lower court of criminal association and given 10-year sentences. Ms. <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON> was convicted Wednesday, also in the special <ORGANIZATION> Assizes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, of attempted murder of two policemen. Authorities say all of Direct Action's leaders are now in prison. Several human rights groups have urged the government to meet the hunger strikers' demands, but Justice Minister <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalendon </PERSON> said he will not yield to what he called blackmail.

 The parents of Baby M have failed to reach an out-of-court settlement on surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s visitation rights, sending the matter back to court, it was announced Friday. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> on Friday set a hearing for March 28 to determine the terms under which Mrs. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> may visit the child she bore under a $ 10,000 contract and lost in the landmark court battle. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> is allowed to visit the child for two hours every Tuesday pending <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>'s decision. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 3 banned surrogate motherhood for pay, voided the $ 10,000 contract, and reinstated her right to visit the baby, now legally called <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. The court said a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge must decide the conditions for visitation if Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> and the child's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, failed to reach an agreement. `` We did talk and it did not work. We can not settle the case,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, an attorney for the Sterns. He declined to disclose the positions of both sides. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, said in a statement Friday night the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> had not negotiated with the child's best interest in mind. `` It is in the best interest of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> that she have the opportunity to know and love and respect her mother,'' he said. `` Until Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> learn to accept this simple fact, there can not be further discussions.'' The Baby M case began when the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> signed a contract with Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> for her to be artificially inseminated with <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s sperm and bear them a child. After the child was born, Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> decided she could n't give up the baby. The <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> sued to get the child back. On March 31 <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkow </PERSON> upheld the contract, terminated Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s right to the baby, awarded custody to the <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> and let <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, adopt the baby. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in its 7-0 ruling, overturned all but the custody decision.

 A real estate magnate was sentenced to 15 years in prison Friday for sending his estranged wife a bomb in a flower basket that injured her and a co-worker. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON>, 54, received the same sentence given to his homosexual lover, 28-year-old <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, who testified <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> supervised the bomb's construction and had him deliver the device in a bellhop's uniform. <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> was convicted in December of conspiracy, making and possesing a bomb, and aiding and abetting in an explosion that damaged federal property and caused personal injury. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON>, 42, and a co-worker were injured in when the bomb, hidden in a basket of dried flowers, exploded at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> building. The German-born <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON>, speaking in a heavy accent, maintained his innocence and told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnacke </PERSON> the only time he saw the bomb used in the 1986 attack was when the government displayed a replica at his trial. `` I never wanted to hurt my wife. I still do n't. ... I have a lot of feeling for her. I still do,'' he said as his voice cracked and tears filled his eyes. He said the prosecution drew a distorted picture of him `` as a cold-blooded murderer.'' Small had testified <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> suggested that he make the bomb and gave him detailed instructions about its delivery to Mrs. <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON>, who had filed for divorce a month earlier after 20 years of marriage. Small, who had donned a wig, heavy makeup and a uniform to deliver the bouquet, was convicted of using a bomb to damage federal property and cause personal injury. Defense attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Higaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> will appeal. <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> could have received up to 45 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> had asked for a 20-year sentence, arguing <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> played a bigger role in the bombing. <PERSON> Higaki </PERSON> said that parole authorities can review both men's sentences and release them at any time, but that <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> might not survive any substantial term because of health problems that include a heart condition Small had testified that <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> had become increasingly hostile toward his wife's drug use and alcoholism, that he vowed that she would regret her decision to seek a divorce and that he ordered Small to assemble a bomb. <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> was an impoverished West German seaman in 1955 when he immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, sponsored by Small's parents. He made a fortune in real estate and hired Small, then a teen-ager, as an apartment manager in 1976. Mrs. <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Pilaski </PERSON> and Small had been lovers and went on regular cocaine binges, and that her husband's relationship with Small contributed to the breakup of their marriage

The group, modeled after the outlawed Solidarity independent trade union, is planning a meeting Sunday in the southeastern Polish city of <LOCATION> Rzeszow </LOCATION>, said opposition spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Winiarski </PERSON>.

<HEAD>World Bank Announces $75 Billion General Capital Incease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a major source of credit for poor countries, late Friday announced a five-year general capital increase. President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the capital increase of $ 74.8 billion will enable the bank to lend money to developing countries at the rate of $ 20 billion a year by the early 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, owned by its 151 member countries, lent a record $ 14.2 billion in the fiscal year ending last June. Agreement of the shareholding countries on the new capital opens the way for `` stronger <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> support for the developing countries'' and demonstrates `` the confidence of our shareholder governments in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>. It was the bank's third general capital increase in its 44-year history. Earlier general increases, in 1959 and 1980, approximately doubled the authorized capital. The latest increase will raise the bank's authorized capital to $ 171 billion. Each of the 151 member countries contributes capital in proportion to its holding of shares, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the largest shareholder with about 20 percent. Only a small part of the capital is actually paid in cash. Friday's announcement said this would be 3 percent, with the remaining 97 percent to be on call if needed to secure World Bank borrowings. The guarantees of participating governments enable the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to borrow money in private capital markets and to invest the proceeds while waiting to disburse it to poor countries. Last September, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> sold a record $ 750 million offering of 10-year notes in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market at 9.91 percent after earlier selling issues of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> dollar and yen bonds outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Leftist guerrillas attacked a convoy of Peruvian troops in the Andes and killed 10 soldiers and two civilians, Defense Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said Friday. The assault Thursday near a road construction site on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION>, a state capital 155 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, was the most devastating in a wave of attacks by Shining Path guerrillas this month. `` A group of army personnel were the object of a cowardly attack by delinquent subversives,'' the Joint Military Command said. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and the joint command declined to elaborate on how the rebels mounted the raid. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the troops were traveling in civilian vehicles from <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> to the road construction site to provide protection to government workers. The Mao-inspired Shining Path has been fighting for eight years to topple the government and install a Marxist state. A year ago, the guerrillas exploded a mine near <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> that killed 10 soldiers and four civilians. One week ago, in a nearly identical attack, rebels killed 10 soldiers and wounded 14. Since early February, leftist guerrillas have killed five telephone company workers, bombed and derailed two ore trains and bombed the office of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and five other private offices in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Huancavelica </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most impoverished and isolated regions, is under a state of emergency to counter rising guerrilla violence. The government says more than 10,000 people, including troops, police, guerrillas and non-combatants, have died during the Shining Path insurgency.

<HEAD>Experts Fail To Complete Protocol on Nitrogen Oxide</HEAD>

 World experts ended a three-day meeting Friday without completing a draft protocol on controlling nitrogen oxide pollution, suspected of being a main factor in widespread forest damage in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Environmentalist groups allowed to attend part of the closed-door meeting expressed deep disappointment. `` We can only conclude that the international community is prepared to condemn the environment to an acid future,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, an observer for <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting of experts from 25 nations was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassen </PERSON> said it now was up to the governments to complete the protocol, adding that it was still hoped the protocol could be signed before the end of the year. <PERSON> Lassen </PERSON> said three major areas of disagreement remained, requiring `` political decisions'': _ When would a freeze on emissions take force and from what level should they be reduced by a proposed 30 percent _ Would the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be entitled to an `` emission credit'' _ meaning a reduction by less than 30 percent _ in view of efforts it has already taken unilaterally to control pollution _ By what year should unleaded fuel be available in all countries parties to the protocol Acid rain begins with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution from smelters, power plants and vehicle exhaust. It travels long distances in the atmosphere and is transformed into sulfuric and nitric acid before falling to the earth in rain or snow. It raises the acidity of lakes and rivers, killing off fish, and has been blamed by some environmentalists for stunting forest growth. Sources close to the meeting said seven countries _ <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ called for a freeze on nitrogen oxide emissions at the 1987 level by 1990. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies reportedly favored a freeze by 1994 at the level of 1987 or later, with a reduction several years later. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> strongly opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for a credit clause in the protocol, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> reportedly argued that the concept of using past actions to control air pollution to permit future increases in national emissions was contrary to the spirit of the agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> has demanded a 75 percent cut in emissions throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, the observer for the World Wildlife Fund, complained that the draft protocol that was emerging `` virtually has no teeth.'' <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said it was increasingly likely that a group of countries, including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and Scandinavian countries, will seek a separate accord _ outside the protocol _ that would call for speedier measures.

 A government council recommended Friday that emergency rule be extended in nine provinces to help combat Kurdish insurgents, the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The emergency rule would include <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, and the southeast provinces of <LOCATION> Bingol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Diyarbakir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Elazig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hakkari </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mardin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siirt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunceli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON>, the news agency said.

Government troops and Kurdish guerrillas seeking autonomy have fought since 1984. An estimated 10 million of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 52 million people are ethnic Kurds and most live in the rugged terrain of east and southeast <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. If the recommendation is approved by the one-house <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, emergency rule in those provinces will be extended for four months as of March 19, when a four-month period of emergency rule expires.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Raised 32 Percent To Help Pensioners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government raised gas prices 32 percent Friday in a new tax to help retirees, whose monthly stipends have declined in value in the nation's economic crisis. President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> proposed the gas tax last month as a way to help finance a 40 percent increase in the monthly pensions of retirees to 300 australs, or about $ 52. Economy Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON> said Friday inflation for 1988 was expected to exceed 100 percent. The inflation will come despite the planned sale of some debt-ridden state companies and programs to push export sales and increase income tax collections, he said. Inflation stood at 175 percent last year, more than double the 82 percent rise in 1986.

 A doctor and former hospital board chairman was indicted Friday on charges he defrauded pharmaceutical companies of nearly $ 2 million by falsifying test results on experimental drugs. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogari </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, invented data and patients, enrolled ineligible patients in the clinical studies and failed to report adverse affects the drugs may have caused, federal prosecutors said. The drugs tested were anti-inflammatory treatments for arthritis. One of the drugs was Feldene, a leading seller for the pharmaceutical company <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION>, which used <ORGANIZATION> Fogari </ORGANIZATION>'s test results in its advertising, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fogari </PERSON>, who has a practice in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, also was charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly inducing witnesses to lie to investigators and a grand jury. He was accused of defrauding the companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, from 1977 to 1985, when the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> barred him from performing trials. For part of that period, <PERSON> Fogari </PERSON> was chairman of the board of managers of <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he was a board member until last year. He also was chief of rheumatology at that hospital and president of the medical staff at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. Pharmaceutical companies use doctors to perform clinical trials and pay them on the basis of the number of patients and office visits and the procedures performed. <PERSON> Fogari </PERSON> did not return a telephone call to his office. His attorney, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucciarone </PERSON>, said in a statement he is convinced his client will be exonerated. Experimental drugs can not be sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unless approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, which reviews clinical data provided by the company before allowing their sale. Pharmaceutical companies provide the drugs free to physicians conducting the clinical trials. The doctors in turn are required to follow study guidelines, keep accurate records and provide them to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for review.

 Officials involved in a widely publicized bribery and corruption case tried in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> have been expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the ruling Politburo announced Friday. An announcement by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the presidium also chided legal and judicial organs in the republic of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> for a slow approach to the case, which was reported in the West and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s state-run media. The trial focused on <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Babinsky </PERSON>, former head of a catering and supply enterprise in <LOCATION> Dolni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kubin </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>. He was sentenced last summer to 14 -LCB- years in jail on charges he misappropriated $ 382,000 in state property. <PERSON> Babinsky </PERSON> and his associates were accused of paying bribes, giving away art work and antique furniture and arranging sex parties in order to attract development aid to <PERSON> Dolni </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubin </PERSON>, a mountainous agricultural region near the Polish border. There were persistent but unconfirmed reports that high government and party officials were involved in the scandal. Friday's statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling presidium, or Politburo, said functionaries had been expelled from the party, while other unspecified `` comrades were accused falsely'' in connection with the case. `` Every inconsistency or regard for the position of individuals or even attempts to shield functionaries or leading workers ... create distrust in the party,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> stressed when he took over the party leadership from President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> in December that corruption in official ranks must be combated.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contends in his annual economic report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that his tax and budget policies helped turn economic despair into hope during his administration. The report issued Friday also downplayed problems associated with the $ 2.4 trillion national debt and record trade imbalances during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. Separately, on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average finished at a six-week high, rising 28.18 points to 2,014.59. The widely-followed indicator had not closed at such heights since it stood at 2,051.89 on Jan. 7. Market watchers attributed the rally to an increasingly optimistic market outlook, due partly to signs of strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy. In an eight-page introduction to this year's economic report, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the country was in much better shape than when he took office seven years ago. The president said the attitude toward the economy had shifted to hope from the despair that prevailed in the early 1980s. `` The past five years of sustained and vigorous growth in production, income and employment did not occur by accident,'' the report stated. `` They were shaped by government policies explicitly directed toward fostering the inherent dynamism of the private sector.'' During a separate press briefing, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had produced 2 -LCB- times the number of jobs as the other top six industrialized countries combined since the end of the 1981-82 recession. Addressing the nation's $ 400 billion foreign debt, <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> noted that the net payments to foreigners needed to service the country's foreign debt represented just 0.1 percent of the $ 4.6 trillion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> predicted an improving trade deficit would provide about half of the country's overall economic growth this year, which the administration is forecasting will slow to a 2.4 percent from 3.8 percent in 1987. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> also said recent signs of economic slowdown did not point to a recession in 1988. He said the recent string of three consecutive declines in the Index of Leading Indicators signaled slower economic growth in the first half of 1988 but not a recession this year. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> discounted recent big declines in the key housing construction sector during December and January, attributing them to a too-restrictive monetary policy pursued by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in the months before the October stock market collapse.

 In facing a proxy fight over four seats on its board of directors, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> might also be facing a referendum on its future as an independent company, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would resist an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to place four representatives on board seats up for election at the company's annual meeting in April, including the seat of chairman <PERSON> Colman </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a roughly 6 percent stake in the giant personal products maker, is attempting to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> into a restructuring or merger that would boost its share price <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> rose 25 cents to $ 38.87 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> pursued a similar strategy last year in leading the successful campaign to break up <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, leading analysts to predict the battle over <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> would be long and bitter. `` Coniston I do n't think is going to go away any time soon,'' said <PERSON> Deepak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rap </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON>, who also is <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive and president, said <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> would continue resisting <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> in the belief that the company would function best as an independent business <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> cited its 1987 financial results, which reflected a 12 percent rise in sales and a doubling of operating profit, indicated that its business strategy was working. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said proxy fights were difficult to win, but in this case <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> management would have its hands full. The company has rebuffed several buyout offers from <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> dating back to 1986. The latest _ a $ 47-a-share, or $ 5.4 billion, offer _ was spurned late last year. In addition, a major restructuring that it undertook after turning down a $ 4.12 billion <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> buyout offer in November 1986 may not have boosted <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s share price enough to suit major investors who remain wary about the strength of the stock market in the wake of October's crash. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s recent stock price in the high - $ 30 range is well below the high - $ 40 to low - $ 50 range analysts estimate is the company's `` It's really a referendum, like a vote for <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> is a vote for the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Shore. `` That's going to be very difficult for shareholders to turn down.'' <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> must have <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s consent to launch a takeover of the company under terms of a 10-year standstill agreement it signed in November 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> bought out <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 14 percent stake in the company after spurning the $ 4.12 billion offer. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> reportedly remains interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. Shore said that in addition to opposing <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of directors, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> could take other defensive measures including the issuance of more stock, a leveraged buyout, a recapitalization or a `` white knight'' merger with a friendly suitor. Even its candidates win election, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> would be unable to take control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s board because only a third of the seats are up for election in any year.
