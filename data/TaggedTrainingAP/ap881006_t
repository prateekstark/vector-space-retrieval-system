 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday he believes Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance in the vice presidential debate `` headed off, or should have headed off, all this picking on him that has been going on.'' `` I think he handled himself very well,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters who questioned him at a state dinner for President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>. `` I really think that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> actually, just by the whole nature of the event, headed off, or should have headed off, all this picking on him that has been going on,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that some of the points that the Democrats were claiming were made by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in the debate were based on `` things that were not factually true, such as who is responsible for the deficit and so forth.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is making a campaign trip to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on Friday, said he will be picking up the pace of his involvement in the campaign between now and Election Day. Asked whether he thought the issues were being addressed in the campaign, he said, `` Yes, I do. At least by our side.'' Earlier, posing for photographers before a private meeting with <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether he thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be damaged by the exchange in which Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticized him for comparing himself with the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` No,'' he said. `` I thought that remark was a cheap shot and unbecoming a senator of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' When asked if it was a mistake for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to make the comparison in the first place, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` No. The only comparison he was making was that he was being attacked, I think unfairly, on the basis of his age and his experience in government and he was pointing out that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who sought the highest office and won it, had actually less experience in government than he had and was the same age.''

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has banned foreign trips by administration officials except in urgent cases approved by her, according to a presidential order published today. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has visited eight countries, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> since she came to power in 1986, said the limit to foreign travel was necessary to conserve money and compel officials to perform their chores at home. `` These officials should be on hand to efficiently and effectively manage their respective offices and be available to respond immediately and decisively to matters that require their attention,'' she said. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> issued the order because many officials were traveling abroad too frequently.

 Kidnappers holding two Americans threatened the hostages' safety Thursday in venting their anger over proposals to send <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops to police <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s stalled presidential elections. A Christian militia leader on Thursday called for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a day after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> suggested the idea. The kidnappers' warning came in a typewritten statement in Arabic from the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The statement was delivered to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> independent newspaper An-Nahar along with a <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> picture of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. `` We shall use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies, including the card of the safety of the hostages, which we shall make the backbone of our confrontation,'' the statement said. The photograph showed <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in a navy blue track suit with red stripes sitting on a blanket-covered bed. His hands were clasped in his lap and he was smiling as he faced the camera, but he looked considerably thinner than in previous pictures released by his captors. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> was acting comptroller at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was kidnapped on the school's campus on Sept. 12, 1986. Revolutionary Justice, believed linked to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, also claims to hold <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, an author, who was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986 in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The note came three days after another group, Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, freed <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> after 20 months of captivity. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian professor, is a legal resident of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> colleagues, who are still captives. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team is debriefing <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and an official close to the team said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was providing `` a lot of raw information'' that could be helpful in learning about Americans still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The Americans held with <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> are <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 41, a native of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Sixteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and believed held hostage. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Thursday's statement from <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>'s kidnappers denounced `` the rude call for imperialist intervention under the slogan of internationalization by a colonial power whose black history is mothering our present tragedies.'' This appeared to be a reference to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which proposed this week dispatching a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to oversee election of a new president in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a former French colony. Two rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> governments emerged in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new head of state to succeed President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> when his six-year term expired Sept. 22. The communique accused right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militants of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to partition <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a first step to turning it into `` an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> satellite and a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> base for intrigues against the people of the region.'' It called the Christian militants `` the grandsons of the crusaders'' and warned: `` We shall mete out the just punishment to the conspirators.'' It was the first communique from <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> since July 7, when the group threatened to `` punish'' hostages for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Moslems, who make up 55 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million people, have been fighting for an equal share of power in the nation's 13-year-old civil war Christian militia commander <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> on Thursday echoed <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s call for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian and Moslem sectors to oversee presidential elections. `` I propose the formation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force to deploy in the greater <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to oversee the presidential election,'' <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said the plan should include withdrawal of his Lebanese Forces militia from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and of Syrian troops and allied leftist and Moslem militiamen from the city's western sector. Asked whether the proposed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force should remain after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elects a new president, <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said: `` It is for the new president and the new Cabinet he forms to decide that.''

<DATELINE>DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In December 1985, when 248 soldiers and eight crewmen died in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, the remains were dug out of the ice and snow and transferred here to be identified and prepared for burial. Nearly 400 servicemen stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> volunteered to work around the clock at the gruesome task, cleaning the building, running errands, putting together uniforms _ all to see that the bodies were returned to their families before Christmas. The long hours in which the tragic became the mundane inevitably led to a special kind of stress, and that in turn led to a special kind of counseling at this base, which serves as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's morgue and mortuary. The counseling program for the volunteers is called `` critical incident stress debriefing.'' `` The debriefing process is basically designed to help normal people ... deal with exposure to overwhelming and traumatic events in terms of dealing with it personally, emotionally and professionally,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, director of the base Family Support Center. `` What ended up happening,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, recalling the aftermath of the Gander crash, `` was that early on, probably about four days into the operation, people began to notice that people were having a lot of trouble coping, dealing, functioning. `` And a lot of the behavior we saw people dealing with were situations that you find in battle fatigue-like situations, combat stress situations.'' It was n't the first time for <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Inside the main door of the mortuary is a simple wooden plaque, headed `` Significant Events,'' listing numbers and faraway place names that evoke memories of flag-draped coffins. The places _ Gander, <LOCATION> Jonestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> _ are reminders of the thousands of dead <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and the civilians whose remains have come home through the base. A nondescript, 30,000-square-foot building houses the largest mortuary operated by the armed services. `` It's really the largest mortuary in the country,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a civilian government employee who started in the funeral business in 1950 and who has been in charge of the facility for 17 years. The mortuary can handle up to 100 bodies per day, and there is storage space for up to 1,000. The average workload is 55 to 60 bodies per month, but the average workload is not what the mortuary is noted for. War, disasters and terrorist acts _ the `` significant events'' _ have sent 23,722 bodies through the mortuary, 21,693 of them during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. The <LOCATION> Jonestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, catastrophe where followers of cult leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> committed suicide, resulted in 913 deaths in November 1978. The base received the remains of the seven astronauts from the space shuttle Challenger. When a major tragedy occurs, there is an outpouring of volunteers from among the ranks of servicemen stationed at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, as in the case of the Gander crash. `` The troops on this base, they really rallied to this thing. They really wanted to help,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. Before the remains arrive, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> briefs volunteers in an effort to determine how they perceive death and whether they `` have hang-ups about dead bodies.'' Nearly 200 volunteers were on hand when the bodies of 237 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were returned from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, victims of the terrorist bombing of a Marine barracks in October 1983. As is most often the case, the bodies from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> were identified and embalmed before arriving. At <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, they were given cosmetic work and dressed for burial. <PERSON> Gander </PERSON> was significant because the remains came directly from the crash site, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Volunteers, working 10 to 14 hours at a stretch, `` were exposed to some things the average person has a great deal of trouble dealing with.'' `` There were some people who had real physical discomfort, people who were nauseous. We had some people who were coping extremely well, able to do the job and keep going,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. To help alleviate the stress, a mass debriefing was held and psychological counseling was offered. Since the Gander disaster, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and all branches of the military have begun to explore the implications of the exposure to and the handling of dead bodies. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and four others at the base have taken training courses designed mainly to help firefighters, police officers and emergency medical personnel learn to cope with the intimacy with death that they find in their jobs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> hopes to have at least eight or nine people trained at all times. During the Gander disaster, base personnel reacted intuitively and from knowledge of post traumatic stress disorder, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, adding that officials learned ways to `` shelter people from some of the factors that would increase the likelihood of showing longterm effects from post traumatic stress disorder.'' During a stress debriefing, he said, small groups discuss what they experienced _ `` what it was like for them, what was the hardest part about that, because what we know is that if someone talks about exposure to that type of event, the likelihood of them ending up with longterm post traumatic stress disorder symptoms is going to be markedly decreased.'' According to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, volunteers' time in the mortuary will be reduced in the future. `` Once you go past the third and into the fourth day, you can predict a lot of the things that are going to be happening to people emotionally and physically in terms of wearing down,'' he said. As groups are rotated in and out they will probably be debriefed and given two days off before being allowed to return. `` We know what we need to know now,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said.

 The success of this summer's `` Bull Durham'' has helped lead the way to an outpouring of movies about baseball, once considered box-office poison by the moguls who ran the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios. During its first month of release, `` Bull Durham,'' a funny, sexy account of minor-league baseball starring <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, scored $ 26 million in ticket sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Orion release, written and directed by former <PERSON> bush </PERSON> league player <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, has been followed by `` Eight Men Out'' and `` Stealing Home.'' `` Eight Men Out,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON>' drama about baseball's greatest scandal, the sellout by members of the 1919 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>, received a warm welcome from critics. Stars include <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, D.B. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> won raves for her performance in `` Stealing Home,'' the story of a minor league ballplayer seeking a comeback after years on the skids. TV's <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> co-stars. Upcoming baseball movies include: _ `` <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>,'' with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON> as members of a hapless team who suddenly become winners, Rocky-style. _ `` The Scout,'' <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> directing <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> as a baseball scout who uncovers a potential superstar. It is filming this fall. _ `` Shoeless <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' filming in <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>. According to writer-director <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, it is not really a baseball movie. Based on a novel by W.P. <PERSON> Kinsella </PERSON>, it concerns a farmer -LRB- <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> -RRB- who is told by a spirit that <PERSON> Shoeless </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> fame will come back to life if he builds a diamond in a cornfield. _ `` Trading Hearts,'' already playing in a few regions, a romance about a pitcher -LRB- <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> -RRB-, who is cut from spring training. Producer <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said `` Trading Hearts'' also is not a baseball picture. That's a hangover from the long-held belief that baseball strikes out in theaters. The arguments most often heard over the years are that baseball is incomprehensible to foreign audiences, and that women, who make up a large part of movie audiences, will not want to see films about baseball. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, producer of `` Bull Durham'' and part owner of the minor league <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION>, encountered such prejudice when he sought a releasing company. `` Five studios turned us down before <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> picked up ` <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION>,''' he said. `` We were told simply that baseball pictures do n't make money.'' He attributed the film's success to the appeal of <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>. `` Also, young women are impressed with the role <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> plays _ a strong, vital, liberated character.'' By attracting the female audience, `` Bull Durham'' appears to have solved one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s prejudices. It remains to be seen whether it can also appeal to foreign moviegoers; there is hope in baseball-crazy <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the game has been spreading to other countries as well. Given the reasonable cost _ $ 9 million _ `` <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION>'' is assured of a profit in the domestic market alone. A survey of baseball movies over the years indicates that the studios' anti-baseball attitude may have been justified. Even the box-office luster of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> could n't convert the allegorical `` The Natural'' into a winner. The best-remembered of baseball movies, `` The Pride of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' with <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>, was another commercial disappointment. Many other biographical films have failed to excite the movie-going public, especially women: `` The Winning Team,'' with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>; `` The Babe <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON> as the great Bambino; `` The <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> as <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, who staged a comeback after losing a leg; `` The Pride of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>; `` The <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' in which the black pioneer in the major leagues played himself; `` Fear Strikes Out,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Piersall </PERSON>, victim of mental illness. Baseball musicals have proved to be only middling hits: `` Damn Yankees'' with <PERSON> Tab </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdon </PERSON>; `` Take Me Out to the Ballgame,'' with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>. The same with comedies: `` Alibi Ike'' -LRB- <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> -RRB-; `` Rhubarb'' -LRB- <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Milland </PERSON> -RRB-; `` It Happens Every Spring'' -LRB- <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Milland </PERSON> -RRB-. The difficulty of selling a baseball movie to the studios is illustrated with `` Eight Men Out,'' produced, oddly enough, by three women: <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Midge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillsbury </PERSON>. A book about the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> scandal was optioned in 1980, but the film was not made until this year. `` We could n't get a development deal anywhere,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The story had three strikes against it: The subject was undeniably baseball; it was an ensemble piece; it was period and hence expensive. We were told that baseball pictures had never been successful, especially overseas.'' The producers finally made a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, which also sponsored `` Bull Durham'' and `` The Scout.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> thinks `` Eight Men Out'' will appeal to women. `` Baseball is simply the arena that the story takes place in,'' she said. `` It's more of a human story which is all the more exciting because it is true.'' `` The Scout'' also had a tortuous route to the screen. The film actually went into production in 1982 with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> as star, then was suspended. Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> sent it to <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lymberopoulos </PERSON>, producer and associate of <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON>. The story, she said, centers mainly on a baseball scout's life and less on the game itself. As to any feminine prejudice against baseball, she added, `` I love baseball, and so do a lot of women. You look around a ballpark today and you'll see about half-and-half, men and women.'' What do the players themselves think of baseball movies? Here's <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 53, star of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s and now doing community service, lecturing against alcohol and drug abuse: `` I've liked some of them, like the <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON> story, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> -LRB- TV movie -RRB- and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, ` Bingo Long' and ` The Natural. But you're not going to get an accurate picture of baseball out of movies. There's got to be a lot of fantasizing. They give you what the public wants, not what is real. `` I especially liked ` Bingo Long' because it was about the <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and I could identify with it. It captured the particular social life and lifestyle that we all went through,'' he said.

 D.B. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> approaches acting the way Shoeless <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> played baseball: Just do it. `` The best theory I ever heard about acting was from -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, 26, who plays <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON>' `` Eight Men Out,'' the story of the 1919 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> scandal `` You walk in. Plant your feet. Stare the other fellow in the eyes and tell the truth. All the acting theories I've heard, all the books I've read ... you ca n't get it any simpler or purer than that.'' `` Eight Men Out'' tells the story of the biggest scandal in baseball. The 1919 White Sox were widely regarded as the best team of their time. With such pitchers as <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicotte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lefty </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and a lineup featuring future Hall of Famers <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> won the American League pennant and were heavy favorites against the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> in the World Series. No one, however, could play ball like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a lifetime .356 hitter and outstanding left fielder. Once a mill worker in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, he had little education and could not read or write, but was peerless on the field. `` He was very passive,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> noted. `` He took the path of least resistance in everything he could. Everything he did was from a defensive mode, except on the field, where he attacks.'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> wanted to contrast <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s athletic grace with his awkwardness in private life. `` On the field, I wanted him to be like -LRB- ballet superstar <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>. I wanted every move he made to be beautiful,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. `` Off the field, I wanted him to be tentative.'' Players earned little money in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s era and were often tempted by gamblers to throw games. Eight members of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, agreed to, or were aware of, an effort to deliberately throw the series against <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> won the series and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>' poor play aroused widespread suspicion. The following year, Commissioner <PERSON> Kenesaw </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> permanently banned <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his seven teammates from baseball. No one could ever prove that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who batted .375 in the World Series, ever tried to throw a game. More likely, he was punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it. `` They do n't kick you out of the Pentagon for knowing about fraud,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who died in 1951, should have his name cleared and be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> was born and raised in <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>, N.Y. He attended <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and hoped to play major league baseball until tearing ligaments in his right knee. The injury convinced <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> to pursue a career in acting, and he transferred to the performing arts division of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. After graduating in 1984, he appeared in the Broadway revival of `` The Caine Mutiny.'' He made his film debut in <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>'s `` Power,'' and has since appeared in <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s `` Gardens of Stone'' and `` No Man's Land.'' Although <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> has not appeared on stage in two years, he still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater. `` On ` No Man's Land,' there were about four producers, one director to start the film and one to end it. We had five different writers. And by the way, we also have these actors,'' he said. `` In a play, even if it's a <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> play on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, it's going to have to be about the actors or nobody's going to come I enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with walkie-talkie's in your face.'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> felt an immediate rapport with <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> -LRB- `` Brother From Another Planet,'' `` Matewan'' -RRB-, and enjoyed working with him on the set. `` We met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and talked for about an hour. We talked about <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> -LRB- the late <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Pirates star -RRB-. <PERSON> John </PERSON> likes the <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION>. He's a real blue-collar man. Those are the right reasons to like a baseball team,'' he said. `` I had access to <PERSON> John </PERSON> all the time. We had a great relationship. We would just check in with each other to gauge each other's continued enthusiasm.'' To prepare for the film, <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and worked out with the local minor league team. `` <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> is a good town for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A real blue-collar town. Everybody there works for one of those corporations. I think there's a similar ethic about work that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> might have grown up with. `` That's the world where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came from.'' Playing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> boiled down to forgetting about everything except baseball. `` I tried to stand there and clear my mind,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. `` He would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not, hit it, and hit it well. In my daily life, I have to deal with bank statements, acting, associates and friends and things. It's often like a juggling act.''

 It's so, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>. The baseball movie, long relegated to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s minor leagues, is the winner of 1988's cinematic comeback of the year award. From summer smash `` Bull Durham'' to critical rave `` Eight Men Out,'' baseball movies are back. And so what if `` Stealing Home,'' the Mark Harmon-Jodie Foster entry in the baseball movie race, was almost universally panned? Two out of three means <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is batting .667 this year. The bounce back of baseball has prompted musings on the subject in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. Actor <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> delivered the Most Valuable Performance in `` Durham'' as veteran minor league catcher <PERSON> Crash </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, but an assortment of stars suited up this year: <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and D.B. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, to name a few. <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> will do it again for movies coming out next year. The switch-hitting <PERSON> Costner </PERSON> will appear in `` Shoeless <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' playing a farmer under the sway of `` Black Sox'' star <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s ghost, while <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> will be joined by `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law'' star <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> in `` Major League. But why this return of the ballplayer as movie star after years without any horsehide hits? _ The ` R' rating. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>, who was married in `` Pride of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' never enjoyed the off-field activities of <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION> rookie righthander Nuke LaLoosh. And if <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> had played Mrs. <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> might have been the luckiest man on the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. _ The popularity of baseball. Virtually everybody has played or watched the American Pastime. Major league attendance increases every year _ in fact, you can expect that announcement from outgoing commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> within weeks of the season's finish this year _ The `` I-Can-Do-That'' Syndrome. This factor is best described by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lampoon </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Matty </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>: `` Any 5-foot-3, 270-pound slob can watch <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> blast a <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> 95-mph fastball into northern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and say to himself, ` I can do that.' Why? Because baseball players look like human beings. They look like they belong behind a 7-Eleven counter.'' Think about it. Ca n't you picture <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> phenom <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> serving up a cold Slurpee and a Big Gulp? Now try to imagine <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> rookie <PERSON> Jumbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>, 6-foot-6, 305 pounds, doing the same thing. As <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> points out, <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> could BE a 7-Eleven counter. There's one more big reason: the movies are better. In the past, most baseball movies focused on one player, one star. There was <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> as one-legged pitcher <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Psycho'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> as outfielder <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Piersall </PERSON>. Or <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> playing hurler <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> before his career really took off. `` Bull Durham'' was the product of writer-director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, who spent five years kicking around the minor leagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> organization. `` Eight Men Out'' was done by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON>, a die-hard baseball fan.

 Military authorities allowed a Chinese research ship to sail away today after they were convinced the vessel had simply sought shelter from a typhoon and was not smuggling guns to local communist rebels, officials said. The 3,324-ton Science Research Vessel No. 1 had steamed into northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s Casiguran Sound late Monday and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> Constabulary troops seized it early the next day after a boarding party found guns and ammunition aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said the ship was seeking shelter from Typhoon <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, which skirted northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> Wednesday, and the arms aboard were for protection of the ship's 56 scientists and 45 crew from pirates. The arms included three machine guns, eight assault rifles, two semi-automatic rifles, two hand guns and 4,850 rounds of ammunition. Maj. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarcia </PERSON>, a constabulary intelligence officer inspected the vessel for a second time Wednesday, and told reporters today he found no signs the ship or the people aboard had violated any Philippine law. The ship's scientists were reportedly aboard to conduct underwater research. Military officials are wary of ships with arms because of frequent reports of smuggling to communist rebels waging a 19-year insurgency. Casiguran is in an area known for years as a rebel stronghold. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and has consistently denied giving the rebels any material aid.

 <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, whose mother never owned more than one pair of shoes at a time, may be one of the country's foremost experts on footwear. His job: he shines <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' shoes. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> says it's a full-time job to polish and buff the 2,400 pairs of shoes that <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> left behind when she and her husband, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after the February 1986 uprising that toppled his administration. For maintaining the thousands of dollars worth of shoes, about half of which are on display at the Malacanang Palace museum, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> earns 2,300 pesos, or $ 115, per month. `` I know my salary is not enough to buy even one pair of imported shoes like these,'' said <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 29. Soon after the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration collapsed, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government announced that the former first lady had left behind 3,000 pairs of shoes, most of them imported. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>, curator of the museum, said later inventories reduced the figure to `` only'' 2,400 pairs, some of which were found in Marcos residences throughout the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` I was shocked when I first saw them,'' said <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, one of 16 children. `` When my mother's shoes wore a hole in the bottom, she'd get a new pair That's the way it is with most of us Filipinos.'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said he spends every Friday brushing the dust from the shoes. The rest of the week is devoted to polishing and buffing. By the time he finishes polishing every pair, it's time to start all over again. `` I clean the shoes with shoe polish,'' he said. `` I have to use so many colors to match the shoes. We've had to wrap some of them in plastic now, just to protect them.'' The collection includes elegant high heels, slippers with giant pompons and one pair with battery-operated, five-inch heels that glow. Most are imported. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>'s size, 8 -LCB-, is hard to find in a country where the average woman wears a size 6 shoe. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> says proudly that his own brown shoes are strictly `` locally made.'' <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> said the government can not get rid of the shoes until a court decides who owns them. The shoes, along with millions of dollars worth of property, businesses and other possessions, were seized by the government when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled the country. `` We will have to continue taking care of them,'' she said. <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> said the shoes must be continually polished to prevent deterioration because of high humidity and poor storage facilities. About half the collection is stored in the basement of <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, beneath <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>'s former bedroom. The palace is on the banks of the <LOCATION> Pasig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and water is seeping up from the basement floor. <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> said that although the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family spent a fortune acquiring personal possessions, they appear to have made little effort to provide for care and maintenance. `` Water oozes up through here and there's nothing we can do about it,'' she said, tapping her feet on the tiled basement floor. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said that despite his shock at the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' excesses, he's proud of his job, which he considers a `` service to the Filipino people. `` And besides, without a job, I'd go hungry,'' he added.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Israeli army's use of plastic bullets to break up Palestinian demonstrations is filling hospital wards with casualties and prompting calls for tighter controls. Victims of the new ammunition, including two teen-agers treated for plastic bullet wounds at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, complain that stones thrown by protesters do not warrant the penalty. `` It's unreasonable punishment,'' said <PERSON> Mazul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lail </PERSON>, 19, a tailor who was shot in the ankle. In a nearby bed, 16-year-old <PERSON> Rifaat </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, a construction worker, nodded in agreement. `` It is n't right and it is n't fair for the soldiers to shoot innocent people,'' <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> said, shifting uncomfortably with a bullet wound in his left side. The plastic bullet was introduced in August to supplement rubber bullets, water cannons, tear gas and clubs in dealing with the uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the other weapons `` proved to be insufficient to cope with stone throwing'' and that the army needed something less lethal than lead bullets. The aim, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said, is to reduce anti-Israeli violence in the territories with a minimum of fatalities. Since the uprising began Dec. 8, at least 280 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds injured. Six Israelis have died. But <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has acknowledged that the introduction of the plastic bullets may lead to more injuries. In the past three weeks, more than 325 Palestinians have been wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, many by plastic bullets, hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources say. The army says plastic bullets can penetrate the body, but they are not supposed to be lethal if fired from at least 70 yards. However, at least four deaths from plastic bullets have been reported at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Last week, Dr. <PERSON> Rustum </PERSON> <PERSON> Namari </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, showed reporters fragments of a plastic bullet removed from the brain of a critically injured <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> youth. <PERSON> Namari </PERSON> said the bullet appeared to have been fired at close range. `` If a plastic bullet enters the throat, chest or abdomen, it has the potential to cause death,'' said a surgeon at <ORGANIZATION> Shifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymnity. `` Remember, too, that bullets respect no age,'' he added. Victims, he said, have ranged in age from 7 to 90. The bullets, developed after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials studied use of plastic ammunition in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, are produced in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Similar plastic rounds have been used in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for riot control since 1970, and at least 13 deaths have been attributed to them there. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> have objected to the use of plastic ammunition against <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators, and opposition has been mounting in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A senior official of the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which provides humanitarian services to Palestinian refugees, filed a complaint with Israeli military officials after casualties in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> jumped from 19 in July to more than 130 in September. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> filed a petition with Israeli Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON>, urging him to issue legal guidelines on the use of the new bullets. The group contended that `` opening fire for purposes of deterrence is an illegal act'' and called on <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> to block use of the bullet for riot control. Until recently, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were instructed to fire lead or plastic bullets only if their lives were in imminent danger. In recent weeks, however, firing rules have been changed so troops may use the plastic rounds to break up demonstrations. The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, told a parliament committee Tuesday that the army needed to stop riots before they get out of hand. `` Arabs who deliberately choose to go out and demonstrate are getting injured,'' <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> was quoted as saying in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> newspapers. `` Eventually they will realize that it is not in their interest to get involved in riots.'' But he insisted strict orders had been issued against misusing the new weapon. In addition to a firing range of 70 yards, the bullets are to be aimed only at legs, <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said.

A summit would effectively normalize relations, which have been difficult since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> split in 1960 over ideological differences and leadership of the Communist world. Relations reached bottom with border fighting in 1969. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s diplomatic impasse with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is just as old. Heads of government met last when <PERSON> Chou </PERSON>, as premier, visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in 1960, and the last Indian prime minister who traveled to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> in 1954. The two most populous nations in the world have been at odds because of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet stance, close <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and a border feud that led to fighting in 1962. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also is forging new ties with another former enemy in war, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Direct and indirect trade could double to the equivalent of $ 3 billion this year and <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province, facing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, recently agreed to an exchange of trade offices with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. South Korean auto and electronics makers plan to invest in Chinese plants, and tourists from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are being welcomed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Formal diplomatic ties are unlikely soon, however, because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains close to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, its economically moribund ally in the Korean War of 1950-53. Qian, the foreign minister, said in a recent interview that economic ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were `` only natural'' as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> opened up its coastal areas. The mood of detente also extends to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a frequent object of Chinese criticism despite its role as a major trading partner and chief source of financial aid. Japanese officials in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> note a marked reduction over the past year in Chinese warnings about a resurgence in Japanese militarism or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s tendency to forget crimes it committed in World War II. Both nations called the visit by Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in August the beginning of a `` new era'' in relations. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has said since gaining power a decade ago that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs peace on its borders to achieve economic development. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began border talks with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1981 and negotiations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1982. Little progress has been made in either forum. The possibility of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> standing on the Great Wall owes more to the more relaxed state of the world. U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements, moves to settle wars in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and prospects for peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and other areas appear to have given <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> more room to maneuver. `` Dialogue is taking the place of confrontation and the tendency to seek peaceful settlement of international disputes is growing,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said in a recent address to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. A Western diplomat said: `` The Chinese may see the world as less dangerous to their interests. If you do n't have to use a lot of energy to protect yourself, it gives you more flexibility.'' Younger leaders who have emerged in the past year are edging away from a foreign policy based mainly on the restating of formulas and principles. One of them, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, noted recently that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> share a 4,300-mile border and declared: `` Strain on relations between the two countries is not in the interest of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because we need to modernize our country in a peaceful environment.''

 Romance, clodhopper shoes for men and lullaby tapes for yuppie babies will be hot in 1989, but it will be a ho-hum year for fashions and a bad year for fat kids, according to The American Forecaster 1989. Other'89 trends identified by the Forecaster: gutterless bowling alleys, fighting dogs on steroids and <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> hunting. New Age religion channeling will become passe in 1989, along with teddy bears and soft cookies, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, author of the sixth annual 192-page Forecaster, which went on sale this week. Long said 1989 could be a boring year trend-wise. The problem, he said, is that baby boomers _ the one-third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population born between the years 1946 and 1964 _ are concentrating on their careers and families, and college students have grown serious. The rise of romance and a growing de-emphasis on sex in advertising, movies and television are directly linked to the aging baby boomers, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` More of them are having their first kids, and that tends to slow you down and keep you close to home,'' he said. Long was surprised by the growing popularity of lullaby tapes for the babies of baby-boomer moms. `` Baby boomer mothers who do n't have time or do n't know how to sing lullabies are buying tapes from the professionals,'' he said Clothing styles are becoming conservative and utilitarian, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` There is nothing in men's or women's fashions that is a jump ahead _ pretty boring,'' he said. In men's footwear, this means the return of big shoes _ expensive, leather wingtips and brogues. `` The big shoe thing has been building slowly and is part of the gradual return to traditional clothing,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Long, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> free-lance writer, has been writing The American Forecaster since 1983. His predictions have gained such respectability that the Old Farmer's Almanac gave Long space in the 1988 and 1989 editions. Long said the New Age practice of channeling, popularized by actress <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLain </PERSON>, will fade in 1989 because of skepticism and ridicule. But astrology will remain hot in 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> said, mainly because of President and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reliance on astrological interpretations and the subsequent efforts by astrologers to legitimize the practice as a science. Out-of-shape youngsters will be put in fitness programs as the preoccupation with health trickles down from adults to their offspring, Long predicted. Some curiosities among the trends that will take hold in 1989: steroid use to make fighting dogs meaner and stronger, gutterless bowling alleys and a surge in <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> hunting, which <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said was becoming popular because the birds are tough to shoot. Gutterless bowling alleys are for novices and the hopelessly uncoordinated, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Inflatable tubes are placed in the gutters between the lanes. Long said in an interview last week that of his 1988 forecasts, he is proudest of his prediction that girdle sales would increase and of his identification of biodegradable plastics as an important development. On the down side, he was off the mark in predicting the end of the TV shows `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Dynasty'' and in saying that Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> would go prime time. Long wrote in the'89 Forecaster that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be the next president, but last week he hedged. `` According to every single indicator from the common to the bizarre, it's too close to call.''

 In just six months, Italian fashion has experienced a radical mood swing from aggressive and sexy to subdued and demure. Leaving the miniskirted, spike-heeled woman behind, the Italian designers presenting their spring-summer 1989 collections in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> this week are courting a younger, at least outwardly more innocent woman who loves pants, long skirts and flat shoes. Her favorite colors are tender shades of cream and pink or the classic combination of white with navy blue or black. Her taste in fabrics ranges from diaphanous georgette and chiffon to batiste and linen. Crisp white blouses, always a sign of good clean living, pop up throughout the collections. Some are man-tailored, others daintily lace-collared, still others a feminine version of the bowling shirt. <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s `` numero uno'' shirtmaker, opts for a wide collared, man-tailored silk shirt embellished by a giant nautical motif. The entire Ferre collection, presented in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> Tuesday, was an ode to the sea, with navy blue and white stripes the dominant pattern and anchors, compasses and life preservers printed everywhere. At the height of the miniskirt mania last year, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, known for his staid fashion, shocked the fashion crowd with the shortest, tightest look on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway. In keeping with the current search for lost innocence, his spring-summer collection brings hemlines right down to the ankle and softens the silhouette with wide tops and loose-fitting pants. Extra feminine touches were offered by the high sailor suit waistline on skirts and pants, and enticing see-through, star-sequined T-shirts. Evening at <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> was all stars and stripes in long shimmery evening gowns, the tightest seen thus far on this week's Italian ready-to-wear runway. On Wednesday, the fourth day of the five day showings, <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferragamo </PERSON> continued the trend toward calmer, more feminine styles. <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Soprani </PERSON>, for <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>, picked dainty floral prints for his super-soft long skirts worn under a neat tight waisted blazer or a belted Safari jacket. Evening wear turned the fashion page back to the heyday of the debutante ball. Dressed in their empire-waisted full-skirted strapless evening gowns, they looked as innocent as a busload of college freshmenn at their first mixer. Even when the rest of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> was vying for the shortest look, <PERSON> Ferragamo </PERSON> persevered in its classic tailored style, with a discreet knee-skimming hemline. It took the sedate Florentine tailors little effort to lengthen this look to mid-calf in slim unfussy skirts worn under a simple short-sleeved linen blazer. The classic look continued in the Chanel-inspired little black day suits with gold buttons worn with a Ferragamo logo T-shirt. <PERSON> Ferragamo </PERSON>, famous for its shoes, capitalized on its own classics by dotting the collection with little golden shoes as lapel pins and charms on a bracelet.

Reckless driving carries up to 90 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine; the two counts of malicious mischief could bring up to 18 months in jail and a $ 6,000 fine.

 Foreign investors with a `` significant interest'' in American business or property would have to disclose their holdings to the government under legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` Give us the opportunity to have a basic inventory of ownership of the American economy,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the sponsor, said as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure 250-170 on Wednesday. The measure now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where its chances for approval are dim. Those owning more than 5 percent of a business or property valued at more than $ 5 million or that has more than $ 10 million in annual gross sales would have to report their identity and holdings to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The measure also would apply to investors holding more than 5 percent of a combination of two or more businesses or properties valued at more than $ 20 million or with annual gross sales of more than $ 40 million. Foreigners with `` controlling interests'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses and properties would be required to submit more extensive reports, including balance sheets and the identities of officers and directors. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would establish a registry of foreign interests owning <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> property. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., described the measure as `` election-year xenophobia'' designed to capitalize on fear of foreigners among voters Supporters retorted that foreign takeover of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets should not occur in secret. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have the right to know who holds the mortgage on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, declared. The bill originally was included in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s version of a wide-ranging trade measure signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Aug. 23. But sponsors, seeking to build support for the trade bill, dropped the foreign ownership provision before it went to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The foreign ownership disclosure bill is now moving forward as separate legislation. The measure's prospects are dim in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where it would be vulnerable to a time-consuming filibuster with only days remaining until lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time. Critics say the bill would bare business secrets that ought to be private, thus scaring off foreigners whose investment helps to finance the budget deficit and fuels the economy, creating jobs for Americans. `` The issue is confidentiality,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` This bill does n't have adequate safeguards.'' Data on foreign ownership of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> property already is collected by 17 federal agencies. But the information is often kept secret, even from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and in any case the names of the actual owners rarely appear. Complaints persist that even those reports are often incomplete, inaccurate and largely meaningless and that hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment have simply fallen through the cracks in recent years. Opponents also blasted the bill as discriminatory toward foreign investors because Americans would not have to provide the same information.

<HEAD>Study Says Consumers Likely To Feel Effects Of Wheat Price Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new Agriculture Department analysis of this summer's drought-induced rise in wheat prices says consumers might feel some effect at grocery stores at least through 1989. `` Past movements suggest that the drought's influence on farm prices of wheat will be felt for about a year at the industrial -LRB- wholesale -RRB- level and for a year and a half or more by consumers,'' the report said. The study was done by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Babula </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and reported in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine <PERSON> Babula </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview that he and <PERSON> Bessler </PERSON> are not forcasting how food prices will behave in the coming months. Prices of various items could decline but still leave some impact from the 1988 drought. `` We're not predicting anything,'' <PERSON> Babula </PERSON> said. `` We're showing how things have moved in the past ... and some of the things that we might expect to see happen in the future.'' A statistical computer model was used to show how prices of wheat at the farm, wholesale prices and retail prices have moved together in the past. The model was then `` shocked'' with an increase in the farm price of wheat to simulate the 7.7 percent average monthly boost during May, June and July, when the effects of the drought were first reflected in the market. `` When the farm price shock occurs, processor -LRB- wholesale -RRB- prices for wheat rise immediately, peaking a month after the rise in the farm price,'' the report said. `` At their highest, processor prices increase less than half of the 7.7 percent increase in the farm price. Processor price increases are felt for about a year, but the impulse generally declines in strength through time.'' On the other hand, the 7.7 percent average increase in the farm price of wheat `` generates gradual, not immediate, increases in consumer prices of wheat-related goods,'' the report said. Delivery, sale and consumption of flour, bread, cake mixes, pasta and other wheat-related foods occur throughout the year and are not as closely tied to the wheat crop cycle as processing, which includes the flour milling and baking industries. `` So, the consumer price effects last more than a year,'' the report said. `` Consumer price rises peak at seven months, but prices stay relatively high until 17 to 20 months after the initiating farm price shock. The increase in consumer prices is smaller but more enduring than the jump in processor prices.''

 Some promising new biological weapons are being used in the war against marauding grasshoppers, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In one development, two commercial firms _ <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BioControl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> Bio Tech of <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. _ have adapted <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> technology for producing and storing a parasite, Nosema lucustae. Department studies show the parasite kills 50 percent to 60 percent of grasshoppers in three to four weeks. The basic tests and development were done by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Rangeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> by J.E <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> and colleagues. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said the parasite is available to homeowners and ranchers through regional agents and on contract to government agencies, which use it on a large scale in the West. <ORGANIZATION> Grasshoppers </ORGANIZATION> cause an estimated $ 400 million in damage to grass and crops each year, he said. Spores of the parasite are put on wheat bran flakes to form a bait. After the insects eat the bait, the organism `` attacks the pest's fat cells and depletes its energy stores,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said in a report issued here on Wednesday. The parasite remains in the grasshopper population because sick females pass it on to offspring, and survivors eat dead relatives, he said. Meanwhile, another development involves an agreement with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Biotechnical </PERSON> to field test another natural killer, grasshopper entomopoxvirus, the agency said. In laboratory tests, the virus kills 20 percent to 30 percent of the grasshoppers right away and stunts the growth of an additional 20 percent to 30 percent. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Streett </PERSON>, an entomoligist at the agency's <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> laboratory, said <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BioControl </ORGANIZATION> plans to produce the virus and mix it with the parasite for tests on 1,000 acres in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Streett </PERSON> said that in combination the two ingredients may work more rapidly to kill the grasshoppers.

<HEAD>Report: EPA Rarely Enforces Laws on Drinking Water</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal and state governments took legally required enforcement action for only 2.6 percent of more than 100,000 violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act in fiscal 1987, a conservation group said today. It is the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to permit 23 months to lapse before even considering enforcement actions such as fines, lawsuits or administrative orders, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said in releasing its findings. The federation said the nation's water systems or states notified customers of only 6 percent of the violations instead of every single one as the law requires. The federation said it examined 15,000 pages of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> records covering the 1987 fiscal year and found that 36,763 public water systems committed 101,588 violations of the act. The affected water systems serve about 40 million people. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION>, said he was at a loss to explain how the federation arrived at its figures. He said his office recorded about 2,800 systems with `` significant'' violations in 1987, and 15,500 systems with violations <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believed minor, a decline from 4,500 and 17,000, respectively, the year before. `` All regulatory agencies must have enforcement discretion,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. When <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> finds a violation, `` It is our position that it need not be an enforcement action'' that follows. Sixty-four percent of water systems serve fewer than 500 people, with 73 percent of significant violators and 83 percent of minor violators that small or smaller, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Small systems may have difficulty raising money for the best equipment, he said. `` It may take some time for this community to float a loan. ... You're talking about years. It does n't make a lot of sense, if you have a cooperative community which is moving ahead, to beat them over the head with penalties that they ca n't afford anyway. Communities may be fined up to $ 25,000 for each day of violation, though fines that large are rare. `` It's important to understand that if enforcement actions are not taken, the states are aggressive in protecting the public health'' through `` boil water'' notices to the public, requirements for provision of bottled water and similar measures, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. He said the agency `` heartily recommends'' to the states fines and other actions against systems it considers `` recalcitrant.'' There are about 201,000 water systems serving the public, of which 59,000 are `` community'' systems serving more than 25 people and the rest `` non-community'' systems serving resorts, campgrounds and other areas used only part of the year or by a transient population. The federation's report did not distinguish between excessive concentrations of a contaminant and failure to monitor or failure to report findings. But <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a federation lawyer and principal author of the report, said the records showed 13,224 violations of enforceable contamination standards by community water systems and 4,282 violations by `` non-community'' systems. `` This is not a situation where 99 percent of the violations are paper work violations,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Monitoring and reporting requirements are `` the heart of the law,'' the study said. `` They enable the identification and correction of public health risks before they blossom into crises. `` One <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official told us that some public water systems stop monitoring when they become aware of a known health standard violation,'' the report said. The only detailed EPA examination of a state program, a review of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s efforts completed in 1984, found a `` significant deficiency'' in reporting by state authorities of all violations to EPA. State agencies took only 2,544 enforcement actions, the federation said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> during the year completed only 50 administrative orders, had proposed 57 more and had issued 101 notices of violation, the first step before issuing an order or going to court. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> told the federation recently it actually had completed 183 or 184 such orders during the 1987 fiscal year, but the federation said it was unable to verify the number or explain the discrepancy with the lower numbers found in its own examination of the records. Requirements that customers are to be notified are aimed at forcing water systems to toe the mark so they will not have to face public criticism, but water systems issued only 5,269 such notices and states only 598 in the year studied, the report said. The law permits states to run drinking water pollution prevention and enforcement programs as long as they are as strict as a federal program would be. A state may opt out, leaving <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> with direct authority. Only <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have chosen to let <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> enforce the federal law in their jurisdictions. But in all states, the law was changed in 1986 to require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to act directly against local water systems if state authorities do not act within 30 days of learning of a violation.

 Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is one of the few authoritarian leaders left in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where elected civilian government has returned to most countries. The nearest geographically is Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who has ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since seizing power in 1954. President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has governed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since leading a successful revolution in 1959 and installing a communist regime. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> qualifies as an authoritarian leader but is not technically the chief of state. Elected civilian governments have replaced military regimes in the last few years in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Military governments ruled <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for two decades until 1985. Five generals took turns as president, chosen by their peers and sharing power with them. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s armed forces ousted civilian President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in March 1976 and retained power until 1983, leaving in disgrace after defeat in the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Governing was an act of the military institution in both countries, but the regimes of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 75, are personal. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> declared a few years ago: `` Not a single leaf moves in this country unless I move it,'' and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> probably could say the same.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has been tireless in what he sees as a mission from God to reconstruct a new, communist-proof society. Shrewd and combative, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> successfully resisted the regional trend toward elected civilian rule that prevailed in many Latin American countries in the 1980s. His right-wing authoritarian regime, he says, is a bulwark against Marxism. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> took power in 1973 in a coup that toppled the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. The takeover won wide support because it occurred at a time of social unrest and economic chaos. Few, however, could have predicted <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would remain in power this long. But <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> immediately banned all political activity and purged the nation of tens of thousands of leftists. Most were expelled, although hundreds were imprisoned and scores were tortured and executed, according to human rights groups. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> also outmaneuvered the commanders of the navy, air force and national police, who were initially supposed to alternate with him as the country's ruler. Using his muscle as army commander, the most powerful of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military branches, he emerged as the sole leader. Born Nov. 25, 1915, in the port city of <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was one of three children of a customs official. Ignoring parental pleas to study medicne, he entered the military academy, after twice being rejected as too young and physically weak. In the army he filled out to 185 pounds and earned a university degree. Now, he boasts a boxer's physique and is said to lifts weight daily. He is reported to drink little. According to a 1980 autobiography, he noted an international Marxist threat while commanding a camp for Communist prisoners in 1948 and lectured on the dangers of communism while teaching at the national war college. However, when <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> became president <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remained outwardly loyal and was named army commander a month before the coup. Some participants in the takeover said he joined the conspiracy opportunistically at the last minute. The political repression that followed the coup earned <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> an image as a brutish dictator. Repression included the assasination of critics in exile, including <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>, killed in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> car bombing in 1976. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has denounced foreign criticism as interferring in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. He announced plans to reshape Chilean society and construct safeguards against communism. A Constitution approved in a 1980 referendum bans all ideologies based on class struggle. It also included a phased return to democracy and called for the presidential plebiscite that occurred Wednesday. He launched a free-market economic program that, coupled with heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued currency, produced a financial near-collapse in the early 1980s. Massive anti-government protests threatened to topple his government. But he moderated his policies, winning even the begrudged praise of his opponents with five years of steady economic growth and stability. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> preaches patriotism, family values and hard work. His stern demeanor appeals to many common Chileans, but his behavior bothers most educated citizens. He often appears in public with his wife, <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>. They have three daughters and two sons. In recent years, especially since a September 1986 assasination attempt by leftist guerrillas, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has come to cite God. In 1987 he declared, `` God put me on the top.'' Now obsessed with personal security, his motorcade routinely includes four cars of heavily armed bodyguards, a van carry an army commando unit, an ambulance and an army helicopter gunship.

<HEAD>It Was a Pretty Good Summer for Airlines, Their Passengers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's airlines did a pretty good job of delivering their passengers on time this past summer, with more than four of every five flights arriving near schedule, government figures show. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that in August the 13 leading airlines had an on-time record of 83 percent, the second best since monthly reports have been available. The only better month was June, which had an 84.3 percent on-time record, the government said. From April through August the airlines reported better than 80 percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule _ considered on time by the government _ each month. The summer months normally have delay problems because of the heavy vacation travel as well as frequent thundershowers and other weather problems, according to industry experts. Two years ago the summer travel months brought record flight delays and loud complaints. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported more than 1,000 delays a day because of air traffic control problems alone in the summer of 1986. That was an increase of 25 percent over the previous years. No statistics on total number of delays were available at that time. The delay problem eased a bit in the summer of 1987, but congressional pressure and loud protests from air travelers prompted the department to order the airlines to provide monthly on-time performance reports beginning in September 1987. During the first year of the reporting requirement, the air carriers averaged a 78 percent on-time record, the department said Wednesday. Air traveler complaints to the department's consumer affairs office have declined sharply, according to the figures provided Wednesday. During September, the last month available, the department received 1,897 such complaints, 20 percent fewer than in August and 66 percent fewer than in September 1987, when the department received 5,618 complaints from air travelers. The on-time statistics cover the 13 leading airlines and do not include delays attributed to mechanical problems, although they do include delays caused by poor weather. In August, according to the department, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> had the best on-time record among the largest air carriers, with 86.9 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 86.8 -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 85.9 -RRB-. The overall best on-time record was given to two smaller <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> carriers _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> -LRB- 91.5 percent -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 90.5 percent -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> reported the worst on-time records, with one of every four flights arriving late, the department said. The <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, airport had the best arrival record in August, with 91.4 percent of the flights landing within 15 minutes of schedule. The <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> airport, where repairs on a runway have contributed to delays, had the worst record, with 71.3 percent of the flights landing on time. <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> had the worst complaint record with 12.57 complaints for every 100,000 passengers flown in September, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> with 11.45. Meanwhile, in August the number of mishandled bags was down slightly, averaging 7.03 for every 1,000 passengers, compared with 7.15 in July. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> had the highest number of mishandled baggage reports, with 10.77 for every 1,000 passengers, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at 8.93 per 1,000 passengers.

<HEAD>Congress Putting Final Touches To Radon Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is putting the finishing touches on a campaign to reduce indoor exposure to radon, the naturally occurring gas that health officials say is second only to smoking as a cause of lung cancer deaths. Pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is House-passed legislation that would require inspections of public schools for dangerous levels of radon and set a long-term national goal of having indoor air as free of the gas as the air outdoors. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said he expects the bill to easily clear the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the closing days of the 1988 session and go to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where it already has been endorsed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The broadly supported legislation, which won voice-vote approval in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, is moving toward the statute books in the wake of a recent warning by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The agencies advised people to have their residences tested for radon, an odorless, colorless gas produced by the decay of uranium deposits found in the ground in many parts of the nation. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and USPHS estimated that nationally one of every 10 houses could have dangerous levels of radon. They said they believe such levels are present in about 25 percent of the homes in 17 states where radon deposits are prevalent. Authorities have estimated that indoor concentrations of radon are responsible for as many as 20,000 lung cancer deaths annually. The House-passed bill would require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a national survey of school buildings and advise local education agencies about ways of reducing high concentrations of radon. It would authorize $ 30 million over the next three years for a matching grant program to help states set up their own radon control programs. Less than half the states now have such programs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would be required to set up training programs to teach state and local officials proper techniques for radon monitoring, assessment and mitigation. It also would have to set standards for certifying radon measuring devices and rating the effectiveness of radon-control contractors. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the bill's floor manager in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said these provisions are needed to protect homeowners from unscrupulous contractors and profiteers. `` New radon testing and mitigation companies spring up overnight, and unfortunately not all of them are qualified or scrupulous,'' he said. `` Contractors have charged as much as $ 4,000 when they could have charged $ 1,000 and still profited nicely,'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said. `` Even worse, salespeople have tried to palm off fly paper and vacuum cleaners as testing and mitigation devices.'' The bill also would create a process under which state and local building codes would eventually be revised to require the use of construction techniques that would minimize the entry of radon into structures. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as the level at which homeowners should take steps to make their houses more resistant to radon seepage from the ground. House sponsors of the bill say it is uncertain whether this level is fully protective of human health during long-term exposure to indoor radon. They said this is why they want to set a national goal of minimizing exposure to radon.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued a challenge to anti-Semitism at home and abroad as he dedicated a Holocaust museum in the face of protesters who called the memorial un-American and anti-Christian. In a speech at a cornerstone ceremony near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday said the Holocaust Memorial Museum, scheduled for completion on the site in 1992, `` will examine the nature and meaning of the continuing curse that is anti-Semitism.'' `` I think all of us here are aware of those, even among our own countrymen, who have dedicated themselves to the disgusting task of minimizing or even denying the truth of the Holocaust,'' he said. `` This act of intellectual genocide must not go unchallenged.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to groups that dispute the generally accepted account of the murder of about 6 million Jews and other persecuted people in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps during World War II. `` And yet, just as we must challenge it here at home, so too we must challenge anti-Semitism abroad,'' the president said, accusing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> of `` intellectual infamy'' and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of `` the subtler forms of anti-Semitism.'' `` We know that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, whose peackeepers were honored only last week for their service to the world, has yet to repeal its infamous resolution equating Zionism and racism,'' he told his audience. `` We know where such intellectual infamy can lead. The world has learned that when the truth is turned on its head, holocausts become possible. `` And there are subtler forms of anti-Semitism,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added. `` There are still tens of thousands _ maybe even hundreds of thousands _ of Soviet Jews who wait to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> so that they may live free as Jews. And here, as we lay this cornerstone and vow that the Jewish people will never stand alone against tyranny, I want to ask the Soviet leaders a question: Where are those exit visas?'' This and other remarks of the president were greeted with warm applause by the invited audience of about 1,500. The president, assisted by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerhoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, pulled a gold cord to reveal the chunk of pink <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> granite that will stand at the corner of the museum. As the president's motorcade approached the site, however, it passed a scattering of pickets carrying signs. One read, `` Stop Un-American Holocaust Museum on Our Historic Mall.'' Another attacked the museum as `` Anti-American, Anti-Christian, Anti-Truth.''

<HEAD>Reagan Hopes To Send Arms to Contras Despite Warnings From
Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White House officials insist they are continuing to look into prospects for renewing military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, despite warnings from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that the administration does n't have the votes needed to free $ 16.5 million in stockpiled weapons for the rebels. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that `` it's all under consideration, and we have n't made a formal decision.'' A senior administration official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, supported <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s comments, saying the administration wanted to make clear `` we are not abandoning the Contras.'' The official acknowledged that hopes were dim for getting the stockpiled weapons to the rebels this congressional term. But he also indicated that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aides were looking toward the possibility of renewing military aid under the next administration, particularly if Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected. If the White House were to seek release of the weapons, it would have to move quickly. Lawmakers, eager to return home to campaign this election year, are expected to wrap up work on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> next week. `` There is some feeling now that a request could n't be passed. ... We've had congressional leaders tell us the votes are n't there,'' the official said But he added that the issue, for the administration, is `` a question of timing. Right now we're running out of time, and it may be better to wait until the next administration.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that a provision in a defense appropriations bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed last weekend permits the president to request a congressional vote on whether to release the $ 16.5 million weapons stockpile, now stored in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, to the rebels. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected an administration military aid request last Feb. 3, and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contras occurred on Feb. 29. Delivery of the equipment was halted because of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace process and the cease-fire between the Contras and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. The spokesman also pointed out that under the legislation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> must meet certain criteria in order to request the congressional vote. Besides certifying that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has sparked a crisis in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the administration must consult with the four Central American democracies. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president's justification for the release of the aid also must meet two out of three conditions cited in the legislation. Of the three, he said, the administration believes two had been met: continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and Sandinista violations of the peace accords. The spokesman called the third condition _ that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have initiated an `` all-out attack'' against the Contras _ `` an open question.''

<HEAD>Research Reveals Widespread Pollution in European Waters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acid rain has polluted more than half of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s lakes and rivers, and the contamination has spread much farther than earlier believed, an international report said. The report, which was released Wednesday, said nearly all small bodies of water in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are so badly contaminated that they can no longer be used for drinking water. It also said the actual damage could be much worse because the research was based mainly on information provided by the countries involved. `` In some cases, it is too late to do anything,'' said <PERSON> Kaarle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON>, head of the Finnish <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> team which conducted the survey for the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. `` In other countries, particularly the peripheral regions such as <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and southernmost <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, there is still hope,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` But many small lakes and rivers, especially in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, are dead, and only a 100 percent drop in sulfur emissions can save them,'' he said. He also said dumping heavy doses of lime could also help reduce acidity. The year-long research project showed nearly all smaller bodies of water in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can no longer be used as sources of drinking water, <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> said. Acid rain carries a high concentration of acids produced by sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other chemicals emitted during the burning of fossil fuels. The U.N.-sponsored conference, which drew participants from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and nine west European nations, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to adopt stricter measures to fight pollution caused by nitrogen and sulfur emissions. The commission's member countries have decided to start a joint international pollution monitoring project in 1989 to study environmental changes caused by acid rain. `` Despite certain opposition to such research, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, we can can safely say that acidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been criticized by environmentalists for failing to do more to solve the problem of acid rain during his two terms in office. In August, however, he gave the go-ahead for continuing negotiations toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in an international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid rain. <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> rejected as `` nonsense'' the argument that no conclusive evidence exists that fossil fuel-fired power stations contribute heavily to acid rain. `` Whatever people say, I've seen enough reports and been to enough conventions like the one here today to know that we have such conclusive evidence,'' he said. The high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countries which rely heavily on fossil fuels. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, both heavy coal users, are the only European nations which refused to join in a project to reduce sulfur emissions by 30 percent of 1980 levels by 1993. Acid rain in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, mostly from industrial centers in eastern and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, also has contaminated lakes and forests. Finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in what had been considered virgin <LOCATION> Lapland </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> caused by huge Soviet copper and nickel works in the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Probe Finds Price Increases But No `Price Gouging'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Price gouging at the nation's supermarkets, a concern raised by lawmakers as drought crept over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> croplands, has not materialized despite some unexplained cost increases, congressional investigators say. `` The bottom line is that there has been restraint,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said Wednesday at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on food prices in the wake of the summer drought At the hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a report showing retail pasta prices rose 10.4 percent, cereal 7.1 percent and white bread 8.2 percent from January through June. Forty-three percent of the pasta and cereal increases, as well as 57 percent of the rise for white bread, came before June, when the drought emerged as a serious problem for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture, according to the report. But pasta, cereal and white bread prices rose more between June and August than they did in the same period last year, the report said. Some of the worst damage from blazing sun and scarcity of rain came in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, where durum wheat used in the making of pasta is produced. Farm prices for durum as well as hard red spring wheat, a primary ingredient in white bread, increased this year in comparison with 1987, but that alone would not be enough to explain the price rise. Livestock feed also came into short supply as a result of searing heat, prompting producers to step up cattle sales and driving down prices. Consumers, however, enjoyed no cost savings, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials told the panel. They said there was no clear explanation of just why prices of wheat-based products exceeded levels explainable by the drought alone. `` Prices of packing of food products went up significantly this year,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> told the committee. She suggested that might furnish at least part of the explanation. `` There could have been some labor cost increases. ... We do n't know if there were,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s resources, community and economic development division The one group that should not be blamed for food price increases is the farmers, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` The farmer's share of the good market dollar has remained relatively constant,'' he said. The price of farm commodities on average accounted for 30 percent of the price of food at the supermarket last year. The rest went to transportation, packaging, advertising and other marketing costs. Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D., also said farmers should not be blamed. In addition, he rejected the notion that price increases before June could not have been related to the drought. He said he had expected `` a hot, dry summer'' and the food industry might have done the same in view of its `` excellent sources of intelligence.'' `` Conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found,'' Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, told the panel, `` but there are indications out there'' that it could develop next year. `` My advice to consumers is to engage in comparative shopping,'' he said.

<HEAD>White House: No `Elderly' Index Needed To Figure Social Security
COLAs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sees no need to change the formula for calculating cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other entitlements despite claims that millions of beneficiaries are being shortchanged. White House Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Wednesday said it `` would make no difference'' in what the government spends on those increases if one <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> consumer price index were subsituted for another in figuring the increases. But in a written statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` I do not believe any changes are needed at the present time.'' The panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., has introduced two bills that would immediately substitute one inflation survey for the other in calculating benefit increases and spend $ 1.5 million to develop a new survey devoted only to price changes experienced by the elderly With figures due out in two weeks on how big an increase 38 million Social Security recipients can expect in their checks next year, the committee held hearings on <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>'s proposals Wednesday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> cited a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study showing that families headed by people 65 or over have experienced `` the largest real income gains of any age group between 1970 and 1986.'' `` Social Security beneficiaries have in fact been well protected from inflation over the last decade and a half under the exisiting cost-of-living provisions,'' he said. `` Poverty rates among the elderly have been cut in half over this period.'' Since 1978, the government has used annualized third-quarter changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers -LRB- CPI-W -RRB- to calculate the annual benefit increases. Last year, for example, annualized inflation as measured by that index for that quarter was 4.2 percent, yielding Social Security recipients an average $ 21 a month increase in their benefit checks. <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> and advocacy groups for the elderly want the government to switch to a more widely used price index for urban households -LRB- CPI-U -RRB- immediately, while developing an entirely new CPI-E for the elderly for eventual use in calculating the benefit changes. At Wednesday's hearing, <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> said the CPI-W understates the increases that the elderly actually are experiencing because it does not take into account the higher percentages of their income spent on medical care and housing. Annual differences in the CPI-U and CPI-W indexes have ranged from 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent over the past five years. But cumulated inflation as measured by the wage earners survey totaled 16.5 percent over the five years compared with 18.2 percent as measured by the more widely accepted urban household survey. `` This means that millions of retirees who depend on benefits or pensions from these programs may not be getting a square deal,'' <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> said. `` If all the costs of the elderly were figured in, -LRB- annual -RRB- COLAs would be higher as much as $ 5 a month. For some people $ 5 is n't very much money, but for many elderly $ 5 is a lot of money.'' At <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>'s instigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year constructed an experimental index measuring only the inflation experienced by consumers age 62 and over. Reflecting that the elderly spend nearly 9 percent of their income on medical costs compared with roughly 5 percent spent by urban households in general, it showed inflation over the past five years totaling 19.5 percent for those 62 and over. Had the experimental index been in use, the average Social Security retiree would have received a total of $ 528 in additional benefits over the past five years, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarrington </PERSON>, a policy analyst for an advocacy group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Preserve Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. However, Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said the experimental survey had larger sampling errors than the official measures.

 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> narcotics panel says foreign banks must be forced to keep records of large cash transactions to help block laundering of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug profits. `` Cash, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, are the stock and trade of narcotics traffickers and currently there is a gigantic loophole,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Wednesday <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism, said an estimated $ 30 billion to $ 100 billion in drug-tied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cash is laundered each year. He and <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., the panel's ranking Republican, said that when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> begins debate on sweeping drug legislation they would push an amendment designed to create a paper trail for prosecutors Debate on the drug legislation is expected to start before the end of next week, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for campaigning. Major drug traffickers now take <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug profits by plane or boat to nations in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and deposit huge chunks of cash in banks there, often under phony corporation names, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. The dealers then have the banks wire the money to the institutions' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branches. In that way, drug traffickers can launder their illegal profits and avoid federal regulations that require banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to maintain strict records of cash transactions of $ 10,000 or more. The <ORGANIZATION> Kerry-McConnell </ORGANIZATION> proposal would extend that requirement to foreign banks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branches as well as to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks with overseas offices. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said he expected strong opposition from large banks. `` This bill will destabilize drug dealers' criminal networks by denying them free access to the American banking system,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. `` It will give law enforcement officials the tools necessary to trace and seize drug assets and prosecute those criminals right out of business.'' The Kerry-McConnell amendment would require the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate within two years agreements with nations that have been identified as key money-laundering centers. Under the legislation, all offshore banks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties would be required to maintain records of cash transactions of $ 10,000 or more, obtain from those depositors a waiver of privacy rights if the records are needed in a drug-related investigation, and obtain from depositors personal identification and documents stating the source of the money. `` With enactment of this amendment, international drug dealers will have to find a black market dry cleaner for their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars because all the legitimate laundromats will be closed to them,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> told a news conference.

<HEAD>Proposal To Combat `Greenhouse Effect' Focuses On Energy
Efficiency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new House bill designed to combat the `` greenhouse effect,'' or global warming trend, would require a wide range of energy-saving measures, including a higher `` gas guzzler'' tax and rebates for buyers of fuel-efficient autos. Republican and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers said Wednesday in introducing the legislation that they did not expect action on the bill before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next week. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said more study is needed before taking action to curb the greenhouse effect. Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, chief architect of the new proposal, said available options for reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide can vary in cost by ten-fold or more. `` This makes it imperative that the strategy the federal government undertakes in formulating global warming prevention policies avoids imposing needless and wasteful expenditures ...,'' she said. The global warming trend, which some scientists say already has begun, could raise the average temperature of the earth by 3 degrees to 8 degrees in the middle of the next century. The warming comes about because gases arising from human activity build up in the atmosphere, trapping radiant heat that normally would escape to space. The most important gas, carbon dioxide, comes from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Also on Wednesday, a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a companion organization to the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, called for a ` first priority'' on energy efficiency by the next administration. The report said political leaders must be willing to raise the consumer cost of using fuels that produce carbon dioxide. A prominent example would be gasoline. Ms. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s measure calls for substantial increases in funds for research and development, modification of federal buildings to create 40 percent energy savings by the end of the century, tough efficiency standards for electric lights and major increases in auto fuel efficiency along with a higher `` gas-guzzler'' tax and rebates for buyers of efficient models.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has made a key concession in talks defining the agenda for a new round of East-West negotiations to cut non-nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said Wednesday the Soviets had given up their demand that air-defense aircraft be excluded from the negotiations, expected to start by next year. The negotiations would be between the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the seven-member <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> _ the first such bloc-to-bloc arms talks. In another gesture, an official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviets indicated they were prepared `` to do more on human rights,'' possibly releasing additional political prisoners. About 300 have been set free in the 3 -LCB- years since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president, rose to power.

President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have expressed optimism that the arms control talks, which would cover the vast expanse of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, will open by the end of the year. Narrower East-West negotiations dealing with <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have made little headway over the past 14 years. They would be replaced by the new, broader talks. The Soviets made their demand for a `` special exemption'' for air-defense aircraft in August, the official said. `` But now they have thought better of it'' and `` sent signals'' the demand would be withdrawn, the official said. The change in Soviet attitude was registered in talks Soviet and Western leaders are holding in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> while attending the special session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. It does not mean that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will be able to persuade the Soviets to limit their aircraft, the official said, `` but we want to be free to raise the issue during negotiations.'' Naval forces, chemical weapons and nuclear arms will be excluded. A problem that has not been resolved is whether all of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region should be included. The Western allies are trying to prevent cuts in Turkish forces near <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, while the Soviets say they would have to be compensated by excluding forces in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Soviets' stance on human rights remains the main issue to be resolved before East-West talks could begin.

 Ten teen-age hackers may have run up $ 650,000 in telephone calls by tricking phone company computers, and their parents could be liable for the tab, authorities said. `` They reached out all right,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said of the nine 14-year-old and one 17-year-old hackers. `` They reached out and touched the world.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON>, resident agent-in-charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office, said the teen-agers engaged in `` blue boxing,'' a technique that enabled them to talk to fellow hackers throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It's very popular, very accessible. It's definitely going on other places as well,'' <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` They were calling numbers that were in the AT & amp; T system, and their -LRB- computer -RRB- programs would allow them to ` jump' AT & amp; T's circuits, allowing them to call anywhere in the world. The expensive shenanigans came to light when local phone company officials discovered unusual activity on nine <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> phone lines, <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said. He said federal agents obtained warrants and searched the nine homes. The teen-agers were not taken into custody or charged, but their computers were seized. `` They were pretty shook up when we visited them,'' <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said the parents, who could be held liable for the expensive phone conversations, were unaware of what was happening. `` One of the parents told us, ` I thought he was being a good boy because he was always working with his computer and talking to his friends on the phone,''' <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said. He said the number of calls and the destinations were still being tabulated, but the $ 650,000 in calls was `` a good estimate.'' <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said the teen-agers had been using the system 13 months and that each had amassed monthly bills of $ 5,000. <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said it will be up to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to decide whether to seek reimbursement once a final tally is obtained. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said the case probably would be left to local authorities to decide whether to prosecute.

<HEAD>Experiment Boosts Prospects For Contraceptive Vaccine For Both

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A vaccine that makes the body attack sperm was 100 percent effective in tests with female and male guinea pigs, the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a vaccine, scientists reported today. The study, which also found the effects of the vaccination temporary, raises the prospect that a similar vaccine might work in women and men. But `` there are many things about it that would have to be changed or improved to make it a useful method for either agricultural animals or humans,'' said researcher <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakoff </PERSON>. The vaccine is designed to prevent fertilization, which may make it more widely acceptable than another vaccine already in human testing that stops development of the embryo, other scientists said. Primakoff and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, reported the experiment in the British journal Nature. None of the 25 female guinea pigs that were vaccinated before mating had litters, nor did the mates of the six immunized male guinea pigs. Animals that received sham immunizations for comparison purposes remained fertile. Eleven of 24 females tested had regained fertility by nine to 11 months after the immunization, and all four of the longest-studied group had delivered litters by 15 months. Among males, four of six had regained fertility by seven months after the immunization. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Primakoff </PERSON> said his team has since produced contraception in 17 other male guinea pigs. The vaccine is designed to make the body's disease-fighting immune system attack a protein found in guinea pig sperm. The details of just how that blocks fertility in guinea pigs are not known, <PERSON> Primakoff </PERSON> said. But immune system proteins called antibodies, taken from the immunized females, prevented sperm from binding normally to guinea pig eggs in the test tube. That suggests the vaccine blocks fertilization within vaccinated females, <PERSON> Primakoff </PERSON> said. In males, the vaccination triggered an invasion of the testicle by immune system cells. That is `` not something you would want going on in your body'' because of the potential for long-term harm, <PERSON> Primakoff </PERSON> said. So to produce a human male vaccine, researchers would have to find a way to trigger just the antibodies without the rest of an immune system reaction, he said. No evidence indicates the guinea pig vaccine would work in humans, nor is there any assurance that human sperm contains a suitable protein target for a similar vaccine, he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, director of the reproductive endocrinology division at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, called the research `` very encouraging.'' It suggests research into a sperm-targeting vaccine is `` heading in the right direction,'' he said. The 100 percent contraception rate makes the results `` really terrific,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, director of applied fundamental research for the <ORGANIZATION> Contraceptive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. A vaccine that prevents fertilization might avoid religious and cultural implications of another kind of vaccine that has already begun preliminary human testing, she said That vaccine blocks the action of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin. Scientists are unsure whether the blocking prevents the blastocyst, a clump of cells that grows from a fertilized egg, from implanting itself in the uterus wall, or whether it prevents further development soon after implantion. Implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the egg is fertilized. Researchers overseas have shown the hormone-blocking vaccine is safe in humans and are preparing to start testing its effectiveness, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said.

 Security at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport was virtually non-existent when a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner was boarded by terrorists in 1985 and hijacked to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a passenger testified during the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. Australian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, 56, told the court Wednesday that he was traveling with his family and was amazed at the lax security just prior to the the Athens-to-Rome flight. `` There was no security there at all. I walked out to look at the tarmac and came back in. No one stopped me,'' said <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said electronic security devices did not detect a knife he carried. `` I had a small pocket knife in my pocket, which I always carry. It did not set any security check off.'' `` I wondered why it did n't because it always had before,'' at other airports, the retired school principal said. The court has been trying to determine how weapons, including a chrome-plated pistol and hand grenades, were smuggled onto the June 14, 1985, flight. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has refused to say how the weapons were taken on board. Greek officials repeatedly have asserted that security measures at the airport were adequate before the hijacking ordeal, during which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot to death. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON>, 52, told the court Wednesday that <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> had talked with her daughter after the hijackers had beaten him. Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said that before he was shot, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> told her daughter, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, that he hoped the hijackers would pick him and not his five married <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> colleagues on board if they were going to kill someone. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was single. `` He said to her that if anyone would have to be killed, he hoped it would be him, because the others -LRB- five fellow divers -RRB- were all married,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said, her voice breaking with emotion. Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said her 19-year-old daughter would not be able to testify before the three judges and five jurors until November. Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> had hoped to end the trial by the end of year but said Wednesday it would likely extend into next year because of problems scheduling some witness' testimony. The trial was recessed Wednesday until Oct. 11. The court did not ask Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> where the family lived in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, or which school her daughter attended, in keeping with its policy on protecting witness security. Waving her hands occasionally, Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> also told of how <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> led <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> down the airplane's aisle after he had been beaten. `` The young man -LRB- <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> -RRB- was crying. He was unable to walk by himself,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot and killed by one of the hijackers when the plane landed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> a second time after returning there from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has confessed to being one of the two gunman who hijacked the airplane but has denied firing the shot that killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is being tried in a heavily guarded courtroom inside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Preungesheim prison. Several dozen police armed with machine guns and other weapons patrol the area during court sessions. In addition to killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, the hijackers held 39 Americans captive for 17 days. When <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> arrived at their seats, Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said the defendant `` pointed the gun at my husband and said ` out' and they placed him in another seat They placed the young man next to me.'' `` He was in shock. He also had a bandage around his neck. It had blood on it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said that she later switched seats with her daughter and that her daughter talked to the injured sailor at length.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> shrugged off his differences with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over supporting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels and said the important point was they both support efforts to bring peace to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration offers only a military answer. Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meeting Democrat <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in a debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, between the two vice presidential candidates, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' policy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voters. Asked about his long-term support for the Nicaraguan Contras despite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to the aid, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I have disagreed on the Contra program _ no question about that.'' But, he said, he opposed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policy because `` they look at the Contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem.'' `` I really think we have to give peace a chance,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` and that's why I have been a strong supporter of the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan, a plan that won the Nobel prize for President -LRB- Oscar -RRB- <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the President of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had to work with leaders of Central American countries to `` try to bring about the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure _ that we ought to be trying that first.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has paid too little attention to the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>: `` There's no doubt, in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that is unfortunate.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed to think it was all right for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON>, but somehow it's wrong for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he still supported the Monroe Doctrine, set forth in 1823 by President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would oppose any attempt by European powers to interfere in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. And he said 85 percent Americans supported the 1983 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, but that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had criticized it. `` We turned a communist country into a non-communist country,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is simply out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> noted that both he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speak Spanish and said they wanted to launch a new alliance for progress for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, `` a country with 85 million people sharing a 2,000-mile border with us, with half of those people under the age of 15, a country that has had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years.'' `` We ought to be concerned about that and we ought to be involved,'' he said. `` Bring in the Europeans _ the Spanish, who have a real affinity for that area. Bring in the Japanese, who have a great capital surplus now and looking for places to invest it.'' Such investment could foster peace, raise the standard of living and provide the stability needed for democracy to prosper, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>More Than 2,200 Soldiers Commit Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said today that 2,670 soldiers committed suicide, were beaten to death or died from other unnatural causes since 1980. The figures were provided to the assembly in a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report on deaths in the 650,000 member armed forces. The report said 2,254 soldiers committed suicide with the remaining 416 killed in assaults by their superiors or fellow soldiers or other unspecified causes. The deaths were in all branches of the armed forces, and included officers and enlisted personnel. Discipline is notoriously harsh within the South Korean armed forces. Younger soldiers can be subjected to beatings and other punishments by older personnel despite an official ban on physical abuse. The report also listed 3,723 other soldiers and officers killed in accidents since 1980, such as explosions, mishandling of arms, and motor vehicle and miltitry aircraft accidents. Korean males are subject to about two years of military conscription. Dissidents have claimed some opposition supporters serving in the military killed themselves because they could not stand surveillance or discriminatory treatment in barracks. Some dissident leaders said they would form a special group to investigate the deaths to determine if there had been any improper conduct, according to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had to submit the report to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> as part of legislative scrutiny on conditions within the military. Under the new democratic constitution adopted last year, the legislature is empowered for the first time in 16 years to inspect the military and other branches of government.

 Question: Let us assume ... the president is incapacitated ... and you have to take the reins of power. ... What would be the first steps that you'd take and why? Quayle: First I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country that I'm about to lead. And then I would assemble his people and talk. ... And I think this question keeps going back to qualifications ... You've got to look at experience, and you've got to look at accomplishments. ... Question: Would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and maimed people ... deregulation may have gone too far and the government should reassert itself in protecting workers' rights? Quayle: There is a commitment, and there will always be a commitment, to the safety of our working men and women. ... In my judgement, deregulation has worked. We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation, the spirit of entrepreneurship ... <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: This administration came in and put in a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorsuch </PERSON>. Now that's the <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, really, of environmental protection. And that's why it's important that you have people that truly believe, and trying to represent the working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Question: Do you believe it's time to ... target federal money to the small - and medium-size farmer <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer. ... We've seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad because they have not had a trade policy. ... We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets, and stand up for the American farmer. Quayle: The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ... went to the farmers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and told them ... to grow <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> endive. That's what he and his <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> buddies think of the American farmer. Question: Two guys come through your door ... and say, `` We'd like you to change,'' without offering a lot of specifics. Why would you accept their deal? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... If you let me write $ 200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too. ... We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad. Quayle: ... We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans ... because of the policies that we have had for the last eight years and we want to build on that and change it for even the better. Q: Why not use the military to go after the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> drug cartels and after General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? Quayle: We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction. ... But we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger. We've got to get to education. ... We need to focus on ... law enforcement. And here's where we have a major disagreement with the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. ... You can not be tough on drugs and weak on crime. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: We'd put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we'd commit the resources to get that job done. Question: You said you'd say a prayer -LRB- if you took over in an emergency -RRB- and you said something about a meeting. What would you do next? Quayle: ... I know what it takes to lead this country forward. And if that situation arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I'll be prepared to lead this country if that happens. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... You have to look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of experience. You have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him. ... Question: Surely you must have some plan in mind about what you would do if it fell to you to become president? ... Quayle: I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country. I have as much experience in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did when he sought the presidency. ... <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Senator, I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I knew <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. ... And frankly, I think you're so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well taken. Q: Does the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the American hostages being held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> released in any due time? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... The one thing we ought to have, know by now is that you ca n't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah. You ca n't trade arms for hostages. ... Quayle: There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong, and it will never be repeated. We learn by our mistakes. But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration. ... Question: How do you explain ... how you can be a social conservative ... and still run with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the national ticket? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't looking for clone. I think it's part of the strength and the character of this man that he reaches out and that he wants someone that will speak up, and that I'll do Question: Could you describe ... what experience you may have had and how it shaped your political philosophy? Quayle: ... It's the advice that my maternal grandmother <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, who's 97 years old ... she says `` You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it an go to work.'' Now the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters sneer at that, because it's common sense. ... <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... To have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to try to assist on education ... Closing Remarks: Quayle: ... The road of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the road to the future and it comes down to this: an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> second to none, with visions of greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for the flag and our institutions. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will lead us to the 21st century, a century that will be of hope and peace. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saved <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from decline. We changed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the experience, and with me, the future -- a future committed to our family, a future committed to the freedom. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> offer you experienced, tempered, capable leadership to meet those challenges of the future. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ca n't just coast into the future, clinging to the past. This race is too close. The competition is too tough. And the stakes are too high. ... <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says the best of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come. ... It's going to take leadership and it's going to take courage, and the commitment and a contribution by all of us to do that.

 A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employee, emerging as a mystery man in reports of fresh <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, denied he tried to negotiate a prisoner release with Iranian figures. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON>, president of a trade and investment consulting firm, on Wednesday sought to refute assertions by former Iranian President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> that he has been working on the hostage problem behind the scenes on behalf of the administration. In doing so, Lawless, 44, echoed statements made earlier by White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials seeking to knock down <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>'s allegations. Administration spokesmen have said <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> is not a government employee and has not been carrying out any kind of mission on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his aides steadfastly denied all reports that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is negotiating directly with the Iranians on the hostage situation. Speaking through the co-owner of his firm, U.S.-Asia, <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> said: `` I categorically deny and state for the record that I am involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or negotiations with any party related to attempts to secure the release of hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Lawless also said, `` I have never in my entire life had any direct or indirect contact with any Iranian government officials or any Iranian nationals claiming to represent the Iranian government or any Iranian related interests.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had negotiated in behalf of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a representative of Iranian Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, in an attempt to get American hostages liberated. Told of the denials at an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> amended his account, saying he no longer was certain Lawless was involved in the talks, but that `` it was probably him.'' Speaking on behalf of Lawless on Wednesday, U.S.-Asia co-owner <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said the company felt <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON>'s reputation `` had been harmed'' by the <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> allegations made in the wake of the release earlier this week of hostage <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident. `` The story here is, why are the Iranians fabricating this story,'' she said. `` It's the biggest hoax since ... whatever.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said again Wednesday that he did not foresee any new hostage releases following the liberation of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. `` We desperately are hoping, continuing to try,'' he said. `` I've never been able to explain ... the Iranians, what their strategies are and what they do,'' he told reporters. `` But obviously we could not do any negotiating with them unless and until the hostages are released.'' Last week, an Israeli newspaper, The Nation, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials were engaged in secret talks with Iranians in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> aimed at setting the hostages free and improving relations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> also said a shipment of arms furnished by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was destined for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Those charges are not true. None of them, top to bottom,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> is full of beans.'' Lawless also denied that `` I have any active relationship with anyone on the staff of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign organization which relates in any way to this or any similar issue.'' Lawless worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, between 1973 and 1975, the same years that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, served with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at that mission, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources as saying. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, however, has seen Lawless fewer than a half-dozen times since 1975, and only in social settings, the paper quoted its sources as saying. In addition, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified former government official as saying <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had worked in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s operations directorate until several years ago <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, `` We never confirm or deny <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> allegations of employment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Biographic Register said in its 1974 edition that Lawless, 42, had worked as an `` area analyst'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, starting in June 1972. Ms. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had assignments at embassies in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said, `` We showed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s passport, plane tickets and so forth'' in an attempt to dissuade CBS News from reporting his purported activities on behalf of the hostages, but she noted that the network had broadcast the report earlier in the week. `` He could n't possibly have been there'' taking part in any discussions about the hostages, she said. `` So <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said he -LRB- Lawless -RRB- knows a couple people in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. ... It was like, two and two make a thousand. ... We think it is politically inspired by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesmen have said Lawless has no relationship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or with his campaign.

<HEAD>Man Fed Up With Speeders Arrested for Building Speed Bumps</HEAD>

 A man who said he was fed up with cars speeding out of a high-school parking lot has been arrested for building two speed bumps at an entrance. `` It was the most unique response I've seen to a problem,'' <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` However, it's illegal.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON>, 34, was arrested Tuesday night and charged with destruction of public property. He is to appear in court Oct. 28, and faces 12 months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine if convicted. `` I did n't pursue the right channels. I was basically spinning my wheels,'' <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said. `` In hindsight, maybe it was a stupid thing to do. We do n't want anything big, we just want a little help.'' <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON>, who runs a carpet cleaning business near W.T. <ORGANIZATION> Woodson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said he sees students speed out of the lot every day. They also perform `` burnouts'' by pouring oil on the road and spinning their tires until smoke is generated, he said. `` At 2 o'clock every day, you get a burnout session,'' he said. <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> installed a chain-link fence on his property last year after a station wagon landed wheels-up in his yard. <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said he has complained about the students' driving to school officials four times during the last three years to no avail. So he decided to take action himself. The 5-foot-long-by-2-inch-high bumps were easy to build, <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said. `` Take hot asphalt, pour it on the ground and whack it with a shovel,'' he said. <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> removed the bumps after the police arrived. `` These were just little bumps,'' <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said. `` I did n't think I was doing any harm.'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billak </PERSON> said a staff member has been assigned to monitor the problem. Three or four students lost their privilege of driving to school last year after being caught doing burnouts, <PERSON> Billak </PERSON> said. `` Automobiles are a problem,'' he said. `` We could do without them.''

 The crowd was rowdy. Throughout the vice presidential debate, the candidates were greeted with derisive laughter and raucous cheers from alternating sides of an auditorium calculatedly divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats, down to the very last partisan. Throughout it all <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> doggedly stuck to their podiums, exchanging occasional glares. `` It sure was n't hermetically sealed,'' laughed <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Touhy </PERSON>, who produced the debate program for a bipartisan commission. `` For a while, I was afraid they were going to rush the stage.'' Both candidates and workers had spent the week in intense preparation over the smallest details, and the training was apparent from the time the two candidates strode purposefully on stage in matching dark suits and similar striped ties. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s sole concession to informality was a foot propped casually on his podium, while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stubbornly gripped a pen in his right hand, occasionally stabbing the air to underscore a point. The debate started slowly, but tension between the candidates grew, capped when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> glared at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and said: `` Senator, you are no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' The two candidates shook hands at the beginning and end, but there was little warmth in between, and the crowd paid scant attention to repeated pleas from moderator <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON>, of the `` MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' television program, to react less noisily. The candidates generally stared stonily into space during the demonstrations, picking up where they left off after it subsided. `` I'm wondering if the rowdiness of the crowd does n't dictate that future debates will be held in television studios rather than a public auditorium,'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said later. `` It was a pretty rowdy crowd.'' The candidates occasionally had some tensions with their questioners also. Pressed repeatedly to give his qualifications for president, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at one point snapped `` I think this is the fourth time I've had this question. No, he was told, just the third. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, pressed to explain a fund-raising tactic, stiffened a bit before saying `` I do n't find it embarrassing at all.'' Organizers made no apologies for the stiffness of the arrangements, telling reporters it was their job to produce good television. And that's precisely what came out _ a television program staged as artfully as a sitcom. `` This is a television program, and we've got some of the best production people in the world doing it,'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said. `` You direct a television program so people watching at home have a good idea what's happening.'' The League of Women Voters originally was to sponsor the second presidential debate, next week in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but pulled out charging the candidates exercised too much control over the format and turned the event into a `` charade.'' That sort of criticism, insisted <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON>, was `` a lot of nonsense.'' `` I'm delighted that it went well,'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said. `` There was real substance. This was not a battle of the network sound bites.'' The show will go on. Saws and hammers came out within minutes of the debate's close, dismantling a stage that had been shipped to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and the first debate between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Next stop is <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the final presidential debate.

 <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> residents threw tarpaulins over their Porsches and Ferraris and others stayed indoors Wednesday as the state prepared a sticky aerial bombardment of <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly pesticide. But low clouds late Wednesday grounded three helicopters that were set to spray Malathion over a 35-square-mile swath of homes and businesses west of downtown, including sections of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, to stop a burgeoning infestation of the crop-destroying pest. The spraying was rescheduled for Thursday night, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chief deputy to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s agricultural commissioner. The target area is densely packed with homes and businesses. Forty Medflies have been found in yards since Sept. 26, indicating a serious infestation that, if allowed to spread, could threaten crops worth $ 8 billion a year statewide, authorities said. While the most exclusive residential sections of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, including shaded streets dotted with movie stars' mansions, were not included in the spraying area, many of the community's expensive shops and opulent apartment buildings fell into the target zone, along with other sections of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other municipalities with homes ranging from modest bungalows to estates The nearest commercial crops are dozens of miles away from the spray area, but the pest can spread rapidly. Medflies lay their eggs under the skin of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, hatching maggots that destroy the crop. The last serious infestation, in 1980 and 1981, cost <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farmers an estimated $ 100 million. `` We need to get this done as quickly as possible,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said of the spraying. State experts say the spraying could cause inconvenience, but no health hazard, as the Malathion in the small concentrations used is harmless to warm-blooded animals. However, the pesticide is mixed with a sweet, sticky corn syrup bait that can damage car paint. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who runs Scandinavian Auto Body, scrambled to find tarpaulins or garage space for a fleet of <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeos </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. `` You're looking at about $ 7,500 in refinishing that would have to be done,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. Agricultural Commissioner <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaugy </PERSON> said the fight to save the state's farm industry knows no economic boundaries. `` We're encouraging people to cover up their Rolls Royces just like they would cover up their Pintos,'' he said Among the cities and the sections of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the area are <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Palms, <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> started passing out flyers notifying residents of the spraying Monday, and there have been news reports all week, but some objected they had n't been warned in time. West Hollywood Mayor <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, in a letter to state agriculture officials, complained the city had n't been given enough time to warn its residents or assess possible health hazards. Responded Edwards: `` They should be mad at the people who caused this -LRB- infestation -RRB-, and that's the people who brought the -LRB- contaminated -RRB- fruit in. We're trying to protect the state's biggest industry, and that's agriculture If we do n't do this, farmers are going to have to use a lot more pesticide and fruit is going to cost more.'' The Medfly is native to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and other tropical areas. Most <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> infestations are believed to start with flies unwittingly brought home by tourists in illegally transported fruit, or in fruit mailed from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The anti-Medfly strategy is two-fold. First, the population is knocked down with the Malathion bait, which remains active about a week. Then, millions of specially bred sterile flies are released so the surviving wild flies mate harmlessly.

 <PERSON> Rhinelander </PERSON> residents apparently are a little nuts about acorns. When state forestry officials put out a call for acorns, little did they know it would bring an avalanche of nuts brought in by children, families and retired folks. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> quit buying the red oak acorns at $ 20 bushel after people brought to the Rhinelander ranger station more than twice as many as originally needed for the state's three nurseries. `` I was shocked. I do n't think anybody in their wildest dreams expected this,'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON>, a forester in Rhinelander who set up the acorn collection station, said Wednesday. He said the collection drive began last month, and people brought 1,182 bushels of acorns to the station in just three days. As the acorns began to roll in, officials decided to increase the number of acorns they would plant to 700 bushels, but people from as far away as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> continued to haul their acorns to <PERSON> Rhinelander </PERSON>, in north-central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Eventually, the acorns filled four garage stalls waist-high, <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Doctors expressed fears that transfusions may be causing emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s fever and pulse rate to rise, but gave him more blood this morning as his internal bleeding continued. Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received 0.4 pints of blood in a transfusion this morning after discharging a small amount of blood, according to palace officials. It was the 14th-straight day transfusions have been given to the 87-year-old emperor, who has been bedridden since internal hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood on Sept. 19. <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, head of the general affairs department of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the emperor's temperature was 100.58 degrees as of 9:00 a.m. Wednesday morning his fever was 98.96 degrees. `` We can not rule out the possibility that the emperor's fever was caused by internal inflammation in the upper digestive tract, or by -LRB- the series of -RRB- blood transfusions, or both'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Takagi </PERSON>, the emperor's chief physician, as saying. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has so far received a total of 11.98 pints in transfusions, well above the normal amount of blood circulating in his body, according to news reports. Doctors halted a blood transfusion being given to the emperor Wednesday afternoon before it was complete because of concern over his high temperature and rising pulse rate. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature and pulse rate rose sharply Wednesday as doctors administered the transfusion in an attempt to `` help overcome anemia and improve his overall physical condition,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. The world's longest-reigning monarch has continued to discharge small amounts of blood intermittently since the onset of the crisis. He has been unable to take solid food except for two small fragments of ice and a few spoonfuls of porridge since falling sick. He is being fed intravenously. News reports have said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer, but palace officials have refused to confirm or deny them and have urged the media to refrain from making such speculation.

<HEAD>New Emergency Law Approved; Government Bans U.S. Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sandinista party has pushed through a law that grants President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sweeping powers to make arrests and silence news media during a state of emergency. Also Wednesday, the government banned Nicaraguans from receiving any type of official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The new Emergency Law went into effect immediately after it was approved by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' 61-seat majority in the 96-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. It allows the president to declare a state of emergency and restrict civil liberties for reasons of war, economic crisis or national disasters. In a statement, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> decried the law as `` an unrestrained concentration of extraordinary powers'' that could render <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` an absolute dictator.'' A National State of Emergency decree was in effect from March 1982 until shortly after a Central American peace plan was signed by the region's presidents in August 1987. Under the new law, the president can declare a state of emergency that permits the government to temporarily confiscate privately-owned businesses and vehicles. It empowers the executive to suspend broadcast and print media and communications services `` when necessary to maintain public order.'' It also gives the government sweeping powers of arrest and preventive detention of individuals deemed `` dangerous persons'' and requires all individuals traveling in war zones to carry identification documents. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> External </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced a ban on `` all cash or in-kind assistance connected with funds approved by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' including humanitarian aid for victims of the seven-year civil war between the government and U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also sent a bill to the Assembly that would make receipt of any official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid `` crimes against the internal and external security of the state.'' The assembly will consider the legislation beginning Friday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was considering seeking congressional approval for release of $ 16.5 million in stockpiled military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> protested a report by the country's sole opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, that three activists with the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> were fatally shot Sunday by three men wearing Sandinista army uniforms in <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION>, about 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The ministry said the report Tuesday `` brazenly falsified the truth of the facts'' to make it appear those slain were `` victims of government repression because of their activities'' in the labor group. The ministry statement listed other examples of reporting in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> it considered biased or erroneous and ordered the newspaper to print the government statement in today's editions. `` It is evident that the principal objective of this campaign is to offer the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration those elements that will permit it to accuse our government of being a violator of the most fundamental human rights,'' the ministry statement said.

<HEAD>Quayle Withstands Tough Test; Democrats Apply Fresh Heat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> withstood his mid-term exam, but the Democrats are n't relenting in their campaign to flunk the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee. In 90 minutes of pressurized debate with Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held his own. There were no significant blunders by either man in the running mate debate. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll immediately after the debate found 51 percent thought <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had won, 27 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and 22 percent thought it a tie. The margin of error in the survey of 637 people was 4.5 percentage points. Republican <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> faced the more difficult debate assignment because he is the candidate found by public opinion polls to be a drag on his ticket. He has come under constant campaign attack. And he faced the tougher set of sometimes repetitive debate questions. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> fills a more traditional No. 2 role. He is n't an issue. He is, rather, a bridge between Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his party's more conservative branch. At the start of the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked to defend his credentials and qualifications for the vice presidency and, if need be, the presidency itself. That meshed with the theme <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> came to stress _ that the debate really dealt with the presidency itself, and whether he or <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is the better man to take on the job if necessary. He and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> argue every day that the answer on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is no. And the debate had hardly ended before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated that theme, telling a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> rally that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had proved again he could take over the presidency if he has to, while <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could not. That points to a campaign theme that is sure to be part of the Democratic litany until Nov. 8. Post-debate comments, predictably, fit that pattern. `` Neither scored a knockout, but <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> looked and sounded more presidential,'' said Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a former candidate for his party's prize. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> clearly had done his homework for the debate test. When the first questioner recited criticism of his military and academic records, and disparaging comments by Republicans, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the question behind it all was of his qualifications to be vice president `` and in the case of tragedy, whether I'm qualified to be president.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, 41, said it is n't a question of age but of accomplishments and experience, insisted that he has both, especially on national security, jobs and education, and the federal budget. `` On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' he said. And repeatedly, `` I am prepared ... to lead this country'' if the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket wins and that becomes necessary. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stuck to that line all night. The panel of questioners, three television and one print journalist, went back to the topic repeatedly, three times by asking what first step <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would take if he ever became president. That's an unanswerable question, since no vice president could know what he'd do without knowing the circumstances of his succession. It was not asked of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Each time, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> went back to his formula, claiming strength on the big three issues. But he varied it enough to trigger the debate's sharpest exchange, saying that he has as much experience now as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had when he ran for president. `` Senator, I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, I knew <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' `` That was really uncalled for, senator,'' an angry <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> retorted. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had served 14 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, eight in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before he became president in 1960. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been a senator for eight years, and served four in the House. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took a share of sharp questions, on his political fund-raising tactics and also about his differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on such topics as aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, the death penalty and gun control. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator favors the first two, opposes gun control. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds opposite positions. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said they agree on most issues, then changed the subject. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> tried to make make an issue of that, saying he would n't try to defend a liberal like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, either But he remained the focus. And he is certain to remain a prime target in the five weeks until election day.

<TEXT>
 Military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in power until 1997, government and opposition returns showed Thursday. The defeat sets the stage for open elections next year. In a speech broadcast nationwide on television and radio, Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, formally conceded <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat at 2:40 a.m. -LRB- 1:40 a.m. EDT -RRB- `` We abide by the results, which the country already knows,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Commander General <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>, a member of the law-making military junta, said: `` It seem to me that the ` no' -LRB- vote -RRB- has won.'' `` We are calm. We are going to analyze the situation,'' <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> added as he entered the downtown government palace at 1 a.m. for an emergency meeting with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the four-man junta and the 15-member Cabinet. Shortly after <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>'s statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> at 2:10 a.m. announced for the first time substantial voting returns that showed the vote against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s continued rule prevailing. It earlier had said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was winning. With 15,969 of the country's 22,248 voting tables reporting, the ministry counted 2,754,805 votes, or 53.3 percent, against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, and 2,290,972 votes, or 44.3 percent, supporting the president. There were also 53,292 blank votes and 68,108 votes voided for being wrongly marked. An earlier opposition tally gave the `` no'' vote an even wider margin with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> losing, 57.8 percent to 39.9 percent. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and spokesman for the coalition, declared, `` It's clear that the majority of Chileans have voted no.'' On Wednesday in balloting that was peaceful and heavily attended, Chileans voted on a proposal by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and other military commanders that he remain president until 1997. The right-wing, 72-year-old army chief seized power in a bloody coup in 1973 that ousted the 3-year-old elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist who died during the takeover. If he had won, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would have assumed a new 8-year term in March. By losing, an open presidential election is to be held late next year and the winner would assume power in March 1990, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then. Earlier, military patrols in armored personnel carriers and trucks with mounted machine guns were seen circulating in working-class neighborhoods and slums _ where anti-Pinochet sentiment traditionally runs high _ that ring the capital. A few hundred people danced in the streets of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> slum in southern <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, waving banners and celebrating an anticipated `` no'' victory. `` We all voted no, because we are repressed,'' said one participant, 50-year-old construction worker <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrido </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Zincke </PERSON>, military commander for the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> area, reported scattered incidents after the voting, which he said were being controlled by police. He said anti-government demonstrators erected barricades in the streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardo </LOCATION>, south of the capital, and <LOCATION> Puente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, to the southeast. He said six people were arrested for carrying arms and a public bus was burned and its driver beaten. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s streets were mainly empty as most Chileans heeded opposition calls to stay at home. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said earlier in an interview broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, `` So far everything is calm, but I've got some information that leaves me thinking. There are some people who have seen individuals wearing ski-masks.'' He gave no details. Leftist urban guerrillas commonly employ ski masks, but both of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s guerrilla groups have publicly announced a truce until after the voting day. A huge turnout among the 7.4 million registered voters slowed balloting at many polling places and could delay definitive tallies, authorities said. Voting tables started closing at 5 p.m. and the counting began. Foreign observers said the plebiscite appeared to be open and honestly conducted. Former President <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, an observer, said: `` What I have seen is Chileans being able to cast their votes freely and in private.'' Official returns from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are not expected until Friday. Voting is mandatory and those who do n't vote can be fined up to 22,000 pesos, or about $ 80. In <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the capital city where more than one-third of the nation's 12 million people live, some voters showed up an hour before polls began opening at 8 a.m. Lines more than a mile long had formed by midmorning, under bright sunlight in the Southern Hemisphere spring. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, smiling and wearing a beige civilian suit, voted at a downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> station.

<HEAD>Public Booze Ban Planned To Curb Rowdy Youths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVENTRY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says it will ban public drinking in eight English cities next year in an experimental crackdown on so-called `` lager louts'' _ rowdy youths who get drunk on American-style beer. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the bans would take effect early next year in <LOCATION> Coventry </LOCATION>, Bath, <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austell </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Aldershot </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newquay </LOCATION>. `` The government does not want to restrict personal freedom,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told a legal conference Wednesday. `` But it is not clever, masculine or attractive to drink yourself into a state where you break windows or hit or stab a policemen.'' The two-year experimental program calls for local governments to work with the Home Office to enact by-laws empowering the courts to levy $ 170 fines against people who drink alcohol outdoors. The measure follows a wave of summer violence in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s suburbs and rural towns by young men, most of them between the ages of 18 and 26, who gather on weekends and drink on the streets or in local pubs They have been blamed for brawls, vandalism and attacks on unarmed police called to disperse the drunken, rowdy crowds. Police estimate dozens of officers have been injured in confrontations nationwide with the so-called `` lager louts.'' Lager is a pale, American-style beer favored by the young as opposed to the dark, traditional `` bitter'' English beer. Traditionally, Britons have been allowed to consume alcohol in parks or on the streets, particularly during the afternoon when pubs are closed. But the 73-year-old pub-closing law was repealed Aug. 22, giving people who want a pint of beer in the afternoon the option to drink indoors. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said Wednesday he had misgivings about making drinking on the streets a criminal offense. `` But I concluded that the ... distress caused to ordinary citizens by groups of mainly young people becoming drunk and behaving badly was such that it was worth trying a by-law,'' he said. In a meeting today with the Chief Police Officers Association in the northern city of <LOCATION> Preston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> was to be asked to endorse another experimental program: installing video cameras in downtown areas to keep on eye on drunken youths.

 A judge has declared a mistrial in a $ 2.75 million suit filed by a television cameraman against pop music singer <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, citing a newspaper report of a $ 100,000 out-of-court settlement offer. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> admonished The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer for revealing the rejected offer and said the story would prejudice the trial in the lawsuit by photographer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneally </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> to declare a mistrial Wednesday, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Embleton </PERSON>, said he would not object. `` I have no alternative but to declare a mistrial and dismiss the jury,'' said <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, who did not question the jurors about whether they had read the story. The lawyers told the judge they had heard the settlement offer reported on radio stations Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> called the reporting of the offer `` totally irresponsible.'' He said he would ask the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to investigate and added that he was considering filing contempt of court charges against the paper. A newspaper spokesman referred questions to Managing Editor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, who was unavailable for comment early today. After confirming for a reporter that <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> had rejected a $ 100,000 settlement offer, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> called the newspaper Tuesday night and threatened to hold it in contempt of court if the offer was published, The Plain Dealer reported today. Gates, a photographer for television station WEWS, said he was slugged by one of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s bodyguards in an alley Sept. 5, 1984, as he tried to photograph <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> entering a nightclub. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said his back, neck, arm, wrist and leg were injured and that he suffered emotionally and was seeing a psychiatist. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> did not set a new trial date.

<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic priest who was caught with 46 pounds of cocaine says he is innocent of drug trafficking and insists he will remain a priest for the rest of his life. Father <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who turned 58 on Wednesday, said he felt `` tranquil'' after a Venezuelan public prosecutor requested a 20 year sentence this week for <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> for trafficking in drugs. The prosecutor, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, also asked for 15 years in jail for <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a former priest whom <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> implicated as the man who forced him to deal in drugs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> requested a stiffer sentence for <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> because he allegedly used his status as a minister of God to facilitate the drug dealing. `` I am totally innocent. I am going to wait all this out and I will continue being a priest for the rest of my life,'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> said prior to his second hearing before Judge <PERSON> Aura </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaparro </PERSON> of the 40th <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. The silver-haired priest clutched a red-bound Bible in his hand and had a small silver cross pinned to his navy blue knit vest. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> was arrested last April by Venezuelan intelligence police in Simon Bolivar International Airport outside <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> as he tried to smuggle the cocaine onto a plane bound for <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON>, who left the priesthood 27 years ago, and his wife <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> were arrested in their <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> residence hours after <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>. Police found 180 grams of cocaine and cash in the house, <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Albarran </PERSON>, said prior to the hearing. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> is Spanish-born but was the parish priest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, 36 miles west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, for 30 years. According to <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Edoardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petricone </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiarilli </PERSON>, he has given up the parish post since his arrest. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> is apparently the first priest ever to be tried for drug trafficking. <PERSON> Petricone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> is pleading innocent because he was coerced into carrying drugs by <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Albarran </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> is pleading innocent because he was falsely accused by <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Petricone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> inadvertently got involved in trafficking in 1984 when he carried a package of unknown content to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> as a favor to <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> have known each other for 20 years, according to <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Albarran </PERSON>. Upon <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>'s return, <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> notified him the package contained cocaine and threatened to `` expose -LRB- Gil -RRB- to public shame'' if he refused to carry more drugs, <PERSON> Petricone </PERSON> said. He said the only other times the priest carried cocaine to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> were in January 1988 and again last April, when he was arrested. Judge <PERSON> Chaparro </PERSON>, who is stepping in for vacationing Judge <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Caracciolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamus </PERSON>, indicated that a decision on <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> will not be made until November at the earliest. Drug trafficking carries a sentence of up to 30 years in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 Chileans grew frustrated with long lines that snaked outside polling stations, but many believed the national referendum on whether Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> should continue as president would be fair and accurate. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> conceded early today that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> had lost the referendum. Voters had been asked to decide whether <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seized power in a 1973 military coup, should continue to rule this South American nation until 1997. Open elections for a new president are to be held next year. During Wednesday's balloting, many Chileans seemed confident that their vote would count. `` I'll respect the results even if <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> wins,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON>, a 63-year-old retired farmer, standing outside a polling station in a working-class northern suburb. `` I think <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will respect the results even if he loses.'' `` Anyone who wants to can vote ` no.' That does n't happen in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and a lot of other countries,'' said <PERSON> Geronima </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON>, 54, who was waiting her turn in the affluent <LOCATION> Providencia </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` We have a beautiful democracy, with order and discipline.'' About 7.4 million people were registered to vote. Voting is mandatory, and turnout was heavy across this narrow country wedged between the snow-capped <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> mountains and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Anyone who did not vote soon after polls opened at 8 a.m. risked a long wait under a glaring spring sun. Men removed their sport coats and sweaters, and women, standing in separate lines, fanned themselves or held kerchiefs over their heads. Government television said two elderly voters, in the cities of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serena </LOCATION> and Coyhaique, suffered heart attacks and died just before or after voting. But few people grumbled, and even fewer went home without voting. `` I took three buses to get here,'' said <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, at a southern <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> polling place. Housewife <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Azoca </PERSON> in the northern neighborhood of <PERSON> Conchali </PERSON> said: `` I've been here half an hour. I'll probably be here an hour more. However long it takes, I'll be here.'' National police in white suspenders, holsters and carrying batons were posted at each of the 1,000 polling stations nationwide. Otherwise, the military was barely visible in the capital's streets, sidewalks and parks, which were practically deserted. After voting, most people took the advice of the government, the opposition and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. They went home. Not one of more than a dozen voters interviewed doubted the vote count would be fast and accurate. `` Fraud is impossible,'' said <PERSON> Fabiola </PERSON> <PERSON> Escuer </PERSON>, 24. `` Both sides are counting the vote and there are observers from many countries.'' Election laws provide for pollwatchers from both pro-government and opposition parties. An estimated 500 foreign observers were on hand in the capital and provincial cities.

 <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s new president has asked <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to help his nation halt recruitment of mercenaries and arms shipments that he says are fortifying anti-government rebels.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he could take over as president if a tragedy made that necessary, telling a debate audience the first thing he would do if that happened is pray for himself and the country. The question dogged the 41-year-old senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> throughout his debate Wednesday night with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who from the beginning maintained the key issue was who was best qualified to be president _ not No. 2. Reporters putting the questions to the two candidates appeared to agree, returning to it three times after moderator <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> opened the debate with a comment that, based on the experiences since World War II, there is a 50-50 chance that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could be thrust into the Oval Office on a moment's notice. `` First, I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country that I'm about to lead,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` And then I would assemble his people and talk.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a 67-year-old senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, answered in more general terms, saying the central issue was `` maturity of judgment'' and `` breadth of experience.'' He started to get specific at one point, saying, `` What has to be done in a situation like that is to call in the joint ...'' but was interrupted by audience reaction and never finished. The reference may have been to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The audience reaction was in response to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s statement to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>: `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had said he has as much experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did when he sought and won the presidency in 1960. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he is prepared to carry out the duties of the presidency `` not only because of my service in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but because of my ability to communicate and to lead.'' `` It's not just age, it's accomplishments, it's experience,'' he said, citing his authorship with Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., of the Job Training Partnership Act for training unskilled and workers and retraining displaced ones `` I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president.'' Expanding on what his first actions would be in reaction to the fourth occasion in the debate when the question was posed, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he would call in members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and the president's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisers and `` talk to them and work with them. `` I'll know them on a first-hand basis because I'm going to be coordinating the drug effort, because as vice president, I'll sit in on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, because Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to recreate the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and I'll be in charge of that,'' he said. `` I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did n't escape unscathed on the same issue. He was queried about the fairness of his and Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' repeated campaign remarks questioning <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had unsuccessfully sought the presidency in 1976 with less experience than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has now. `` I must say I did n't do a very good job of running for the presidency,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` But what we're looking at today is trying to judge, once again, the breadth of experience and maturity of someone taking on this kind of task.''

 Here are highlights from Wednesday night's vice presidential debate between <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUAYLE QUALIFICATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked four times about his qualifications for high office, and responded that he is `` prepared to lead this country,'' if necessary. However, when he compared his experience with that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> shot back that he had known <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE OTHER TARGETS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The debaters saved their best shots for the two presidential candidates, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more qualifications than <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> combined,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took aim at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vote in favor of a plan to curtail Social Security cost-of-living increases. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had appointed high-level environmental officials who were the equivalent of <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENTSEN-DUKAKIS DIFFERENCES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was asked about his differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on such issues as aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the death penalty and gun control. `` We agree on so many things, on the vast majority of the issues,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> replied. He said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agree on cutting the budget deficit and on a trade policy that will `` stand tough for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of voting eight times to cut benefits, and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast a tie-breaking vote against a Social Security cost-of-living increase. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> glaringly responded, `` Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security eight times.'' He said he had voted to delay cost-of-living adjustments and that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> himself had voted that way twice.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CLOSING STATEMENTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the experience, and with me, the future,'' and that the Democrats would `` take <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> backwards.'' He said `` the road of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the road to the future and it comes to this: an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> second to none, with visions of greatness, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for flag and isntitutions.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believe the `` best of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come,'' but that `` putting the economy on automatic pilot will not be sufficient. ... The nation will fulfill its greatness but can not afford to stand still.''

 Foreign observers who watched as Chileans decided whether Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> should remain as president said the balloting appeared fair but frequently disorganized. `` What I have seen is Chileans being able to cast their votes freely and in private ...,'' said <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, former president of <LOCATION> Ecuado </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said early today that a majority voted against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining as president until 1997. New elections are to be held next year. Opposition groups fearful of fraud by the government had urged foreign dignitaries to monitor the vote. More than 500 politicians, diplomats and a few celebrities _ including Nicaraguan actress <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> _ chose to do so. `` Some polling stations were badly organized. Some opened late and consequently will have to remain open longer this evening, but in general ... it has gone rather well,'' said <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Weggen </PERSON>, a European Parliament delegate from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Former presidents <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, led a 60-member delegation of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They visited polling stations in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and 10 other cities but said they would not comment formally until a news conference Friday. Some delegation members said privately they thought the vote was free and open, and expected the tally also would be. They said civilians, police and military guards at the polling stations were friendly and helpful. The <ORGANIZATION> Puebla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> human rights group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reported signs of government-sponsored harassment in recent days, such as a mass mailing apparently intended to mislead voters into invalidating their registration cards. After touring polling stations Wednesday, however, the institute issued a statement saying: `` Despite a climate of intimidation, assorted dirty tricks by government supporters, extended delays in opening some polling places, long lines to vote and other irregularities, Chileans in great numbers turned out to vote today. `` Chileans are taking the first real step toward democracy in 15 years. We have heard much about <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s ` economic miracle'. Today, we are witnessing the start of a ` democracy miracle'.''

 When they were n't sparring over who was qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also locked horns over Social Security, environmental protection, campaign finance and other issues in their sole face-to-face campaign showdown. Here is a look at some of the major issues they argued over in Wednesday night's debate:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUALIFICATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked to be judged by his experience on `` the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the next presidency ... national security and arms control, jobs and education, and the federal budget deficit.'' He said his work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including his authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act of 1983, has established his credentials. `` On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' said the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But when the Republican said he was no younger than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> when he ran for president, the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had `` voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security.'' `` That's wrong,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had tried repeatedly to make deep cuts in Social Security, and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast a tie-breaking vote in 1985 to freeze benefits. `` When you talk about Social Security the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats who brought forth that program,'' he said. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> himself had voted twice to delay the Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had supported a freeze at the national governors' conference. He said what the Democrats `` try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, asked why he had voted `` two-thirds of the time'' against environmental protection legislation, said, `` I have a very strong record on the environment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he voted for the Superfund and to override a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto of the Clean Water Act. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also blamed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>'s being `` the dirtiest waterway in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> derided the `` late conversion'' to environmentalism and charged, `` it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up ... <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' He said the Democrats were responsible for the Superfund and the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Water acts.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Asked why he had voted for cuts in school nutrition and against expanding the childhood immunization program, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` This administration and a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be committed to eradicating poverty. Poverty has n't gone up in this administration. It has n't gone down much either, and that means that we have a challenge ahead of us.'' He said tax reform had taken 6 million working poor families off the tax rolls. `` The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` of no help at all'' in the recently passed overhaul of welfare laws.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONTRA AID</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> acknowledged disagreeing with his running mate on military aid for the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both support the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> peace plan for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including diplomatic pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` I really think we have to give peace a chance,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration would cut off aid to the resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had also opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAMPAIGN FINANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Asked if he was embarrassed at being the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest recipient of contributions from political action committees, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he plays by the laws as they are, just like when `` you're paying taxes or you're playing a football game.'' But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> acknowledged his $ 10,000-a-plate `` breakfast club'' for lobbyists was `` a real doozie'' of a mistake which he quickly ended. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` He disbanded the club, but he's still got the money,'' since most of the lobbyists forked over donations anyway to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman's campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had pocketed more than a quarter-million dollars in speech honoraria from special interest groups.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEREGULATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> defended the Reagan-Bush efforts to relax government regulation of business, and denied it had weakened protection of worker safety. He charged the Democrats `` want a centralized government. But we believe in the market; we believe in the people.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said some business owners `` put their profits before people. And that's why you have to have <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the Democrats would do a better job of safeguarding workers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FARM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the answer to farmers' problems is to push harder to open up markets abroad for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products `` and stand up for the American farmer.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> warned of `` another <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> grain embargo'' if the Democrats regain the White House.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> charged that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration doubled the national debt in less than eight years. `` If you let me write $ 200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the Republicans elped create 17 million new jobs and rebuilt respect for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the world.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Democrats would look for savings on farm subsidies, on military purchases and by scrapping development of a supersonic passenger jet. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted against the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. He said the president needs more tools to fight the deficit, including line-item veto authority.

<HEAD>Fog Grounds Medfly Spraying In Swank Neighborhoods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> took cover, but fog grounded the state's aerial insecticide attack on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly in the ritzy neighborhood and other areas where the crop-destroying pest has invaded. The postponement gave about 100,000 residents another day to protect their Porsches, Rolls Royces and expensive outdoor statuary against thousands of gallons of sticky mixture containing Malathion. The mission was rescheduled for 7 tonight. Some residents still doubted whether there has been sufficient notice, but one <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> dealer evacuated his high-priced rolling stock into an underground parking garage and other car dealers looked for tarps. `` I'm surprised with the way they notified us,'' said resident <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` The way they notified us has been so low-key that I question whether there has been adequate notification.'' Three helicopters scheduled to spray over a 35-square-mile area of homes and businesses west of downtown late Wednesday stayed at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after the fog rolled in from the ocean, officials said. `` It was just too dangerous to try it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donley </PERSON> at the state's Medfly Hotline. `` They want to try it earlier. The earlier they spray the better the chances they avoid the fog.'' The spraying was ordered because 40 Medflies were found in yards since Sept. 26, signaling a serious infestation that, if allowed to spread, could threaten <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s $ 8 billion in crops. The Medfly, a native to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and other tropical areas, is believed to be brought to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> unwittingly by tourists or on illegally transported fruit mailed from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. If the all-night, eight-hour spraying assault wipes out enough Medflies, officials will release sterile flies to breed with the surviving insects to render them sterile, <PERSON> Donley </PERSON> said. Most of the exclusive residential sections of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, including the mansions of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s rich and famous, are spared of the spraying, but posh Rodeo Drive shops and many car dealerships are in the target area. The pesticide poses no health risks, officials say, but the sticky corn syrup bait mixed with the Malathion could mess up a car's paint job. Museums in the area covered their outdoor statues. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who runs Scandinavian Auto Body in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, scrambled to find tarpaulins or garage space Wednesday for a fleet of <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeos </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're looking at about $ 7,500 in refinishing that would have to be done,'' <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. But Agricultural Commissioner <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaugy </PERSON> said the fight to save the state's farm industry knows no economic boundaries. `` We're encouraging people to cover up their Rolls Royces just like they would cover up their Pintos,'' he said. Along with parts of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, officials are spraying the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> sections of <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Palms, <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. These communities all are dozens of miles from the nearest commercial crops, but the pest can spread rapidly. It lays its eggs under the skin of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, hatching maggots that destroy the crop. The last serious infestation, in 1980 and 1981, cost <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farmers an estimated $ 100 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but a big chunk of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> assembled in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s colleagues came to give reporters instant analyses of their vice presidential debate They said of the rivals things a senator normally never says about a senator. Things like: `` cheap shot,'' `` knockout blow,'' `` vicious'' and `` unbecoming.'' One senator said he was `` embarrassed'' for another. Protocol took a powder. It's not the way they talk back in the Capitol. More than two dozen lawmakers from both parties were flown in for the showdown on `` <LOCATION> Spin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>,'' the area of the press hall where campaign officials circulated to share with reporters their views of the debates in hopes of influencing what got said on the air or put in print. Each team had rented a charter to jet their players from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> for the night and they sent in so many that the spinners nearly crushed the press trying to write down their reactions. Most of them flowed in two streams, one from each party, that quickly filled the hall minutes after the contest ended. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, rated a briefing all his own outside the debate hall Before the debate, the two campaigns briefed the surrogates. Afterward, verdicts in hand, the responses were predictable, and they did n't always fit the decorum they practice in the Capitol. For the Democrats, the big topic was <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s assertion to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that he was `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' `` I thought that was the knockout blow of the evening,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I think he -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- invited it, and it was a devastating reply When someone seeks to compare himself with someone, I think it is very appropriate to say it like it is,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., who had sought the presidency and was a top choice for the vice presidency slot, said he was `` embarrassed'' for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` I thought that he would do well. I thought this was the chance to rehabilitate himself. All he had to do was to come in and look halfway decent and avoid serious mistakes,'' he said. The Republicans called the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> exchange a `` cheap shot'' and insisted their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague put to rest any doubts that he was qualified to be president. `` That is going to get sorted out in this whole game as a vicious little spot,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>. `` I think it was a cheap shot. That was very unbecoming of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' `` The expectation that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was going to come across this evening as vastly inferior to <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was totally a myth,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, R-N.M. `` He came out quite to the contrary a very competent person, given the most difficult questions that anyone has ever been given.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> comment was `` vicious'' and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s fault was not being vicious enough in response, he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> should have said in the rebuttal, `` Neither is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said. In what could be seen as perhaps the ultimate counter-spin to the testy atmosphere, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., and Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in mock-debate preparations _ stood and posed for pictures in the press hall as the crowd finally started to thin out near midnight In addition to the officials' `` spinning,'' each campaign released a list of what were claimed to be distortions and mis-statements by the opposition. The Republicans won that battle _ their list was out a good hour before the Democrats responded. Some of the spinners did n't wait until after the debate to offer their views, a practice one wag called `` forespin.'' And the reaction was always in line with the party line. `` I think <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is more of an issue now than he was 90 minutes ago,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, campaign manager for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. That was about an hour before the debate even started, but she said it again after the debate too.

<HEAD>FAA Reduces Number Of Landings At O'Hare After Controller Errors
Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Planes to and from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are being delayed safely on the ground in an unprecedented attempt to reduce congestion and the growing number of air traffic controller errors at the nation's busiest airport, officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s move comes after controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> made four mistakes in less than a week. In those incidents, planes were allowed to get too close to each other, officials said. None resulted in accidents. So far this year, controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> have made 30 mistakes, compared with 12 in all of 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I ca n't explain the reason,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` That's the question everybody wants the answer to, and if there was an easy solution we'd have it.'' Under the plan, which was announced Wednesday but had taken effect earlier this week, flights to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> will be delayed on the ground in their cities of origin rather than in the air over <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and the smaller <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> here when there is too much traffic, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettmer </PERSON>. During peak periods _ usually between 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. CDT daily _ the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land in good weather will be reduced to about 155 per hour from 180, Ms. <PERSON> Dettmer </PERSON> said. The number is curtailed further during poor weather. The plan also will affect some flights at Midway because the airports share air space. The policy resulted in a total of up to 243 delays at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> on Monday and Tuesday, and up to 33 delays at Midway on Tuesday, according to reports published today. The weather was good on both days. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> defines a delay as a flight landing at least 15 minutes later than its scheduled arrival time. `` This is a new program,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Burcham </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Lakes Region Air Traffic Division. `` We could be accused of being a bit overcautious if the approach we've taken is too severe. But it's preliminary and we're going to adjust it as we use the program and see what it does for us.'' Asked if the controller errors worry the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burcham </PERSON> replied: `` Tremendously. I am losing sleep over it.'' Controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, the nation's busiest airport, made two errors Friday, one Sunday and one Tuesday, <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said. In comparison, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> _ the nation's second busiest _ has had six errors this year, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National Airport just two, officials said. The latest incidents here came just two months after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issued a report saying that chronic understaffing of controllers, mandatory overtime, outdated equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. In Tuesday's incident, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and a smaller <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane came within 500 feet of each other 13 miles east of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said. On Sunday, two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jets came within 500 feet of each other after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended for the other. On Friday, two <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> jets came near each other when a controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to descend from 14,000 feet to 11,000, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. Also Friday, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile horizontally when the pilot of the American plane apparently failed to repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek confirmation, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum of three miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.

<HEAD>DOE Says New Safety Guidelines For Reactor Got Lost In Paperwork</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government says new safety guidelines for the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> that makes radioactive material for nuclear arms were lost in `` paper work'' for a month last summer. During the delay, the plant operator waited 40 hours before notifying the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> of a small power surge that caused the shutdown of one of three atomic reactors at the plant, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman, said Wednesday. The delay violated both the new and the previous guidelines, she said, and efforts have been made to improve procedures. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility which produces weapons-grade plutonium and tritium. DOE and the E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant under contract, have come under fire in recent days because of disclosures that during a 28-year period, up to 30 significant reactor mishaps there were not reported to the public and in some cases to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The power surge in August triggered a review by an internal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team which found the P reactor involved suffers from `` numerous and longstanding'' problems with its control rods _ which act as accelerators and brakes on a reactor's rate of fission _ that may prevent operators from recognizing potentially dangerous conditions in its core, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` Technical support personnel stated they routinely calculate core reactivity assuming seven rods are not in their programmed positions,'' the team's report said, according to The Post. The newspaper said it obtained a copy of the study, which has not been released publicly. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that a study by a consulting firm of the plant's operations from 1971-1987 shows that chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures caused nuclear reactors there to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a year for nearly two decades. That rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s chief safety operator, told the newspaper that civilian reactors with the same number of forced shutdowns would have had their operating licenses revoked. Meanwhile, an internal memorandum about a May 10, 1965 accident at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant said a supervisor had to stop a foreman from taking action that could have turned a leak of cooling water into a catastrophic accident, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, near where the plant is located. `` One trained man stood between us and disaster,'' said the memo written by a <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> engineer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, in 1981 when he took early retirement. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> had been in the reactor control room when the incident occurred. A technical supervisor at the plant, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merz </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Wednesday that this was `` a premature conclusion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, in an internal report obtained by the The State of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, criticized <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s management as isolated and said the plant is operated counter to `` practices common to well-run nuclear plants.'' The 50-page draft memorandum criticized `` less than precise and out-of-date operating practices'' throughout the plant's management and reactor staff, the newspaper reported today. Written by a panel of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials and represenatives from companies working at the plant, the report criticized <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> for allowing reactor operators to grow complacent. It called for streamlined communications and better training to handle emergencies. As part of an effort to improve safety and reporting procedures at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, Energy Undersecretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> issued a new order on June 21 requiring the contractor and the regional <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office, in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> to notify the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters immediately in the event of a safety problem. The notice did not reach the mailroom of the regional office until July 7, nearly three weeks after it was issued. And it took another month to reach the appropriate office in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, said Ms. Craft. The regional department office asked for clarification from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and did not send the new guidance to <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> until Aug. 23, she said. In the meantime there was another mishap, a small power pulse on Aug. 7 which caused the reactor to be shut down on Aug. 9. Since the incident in August, said Ms. Craft, `` we have worked with du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> to correct any deficiencies that we had. There are several programs that du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has put in place to prevent this from occurring in the future,'' she said. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> spokesmen did not immediately return telephone calls to their offices in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>.

 Riot police arrested a band of radical students today after they stormed into the office of a governing party lawmaker with iron pipes and firebombs and shouted anti-U.S. and anti-government slogans. Students broke windows and unfolded a giant placard that read `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Arrest -LRB- former president -RRB- <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>.'' Students threatened to burn the office or jump from windows if police intervened. Police were backed up by firetrucks and hundreds more police who spread sponge matresses around the building to prevent suicide attempts. Police said 23 students from seven universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> overpowered security guards, charged into Parliamentary Hall, a legislative office building, through the main gate and locked themslves inside the office. The students had invaded the office of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho-yong </PERSON>, a senior member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was not in the office.

One of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s aides and several policemen were also hurt in the attack, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The two-hour protest in the fourth-floor office near the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building ended when about 100 riot police specializing in martial arts broke through the office door.

Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 133.30 yen, down 0.18 yen from Wednesday's close of 133.48 yen. Opening slightly higher at 133.37 yen, the currency ranged between 133.30 and 133.53 yen. `` The dollar-yen rate was moving very little as investors traded the currencies only for their speculative reasons and position adjustment,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 After lurching through bloodshed and political upheaval, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is almost back to where it was 11 weeks ago: with an authoritarian government and few prospects for the democracy that once seemed so close. Since the resignation of strongman Ne Win on July 23, several thousand people have died, hundreds of thousands marched in the streets in a nationwide uprising and three leaders took turns at the helm. Now, some Western experts say the best hope for the pro-democracy forces is that the government will offer political and economic liberalization to appease an angry population. Pressure for change, they say, may also come from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s vital foreign aid donors. `` Given all that's happened, it's silly to write the opposition off, but overall I think the army is sitting squarely on top of the people for at least the next few weeks,'' said a Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The recent chaotic events amounted to the largest anti-government movement in the past 26 years of autocratic rule and the most intense and widespread display of `` people power'' since the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> fight for independence from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But the ruling oligarchy of military men around Ne Win, despite earlier rumors that they were about to flee the country, dug in, maneuvered with what some analysts say was `` Machiavellian brilliance'' and at the very least temporarily won the day. As the drama unfolded, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> experts offered a number of possible scenarios, including one that called for the military to shoot as many protestors as necessary to retain power. This is the option it chose, together with what one Western ambassador in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> described as a `` devilish plot'' of stoking chaos and anxiety among masses who grew increasingly short of food, fuel and other necessities. `` The people have been beaten over the head for two months. They never got weapons and they were never really organized _ and the army never cracked,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> scholar <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>. Although the government has promised general elections, a key opposition leader, former defense minister Tin Oo, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` All the opposition leaders are now facing arrest and other punitive measures. So what can I say? The situation is so undemocratic.'' Opponents appear to have little maneuvering room. Their major weapon, a general strike that began Aug. 8, was blunted when civil servants and factory workers threatened by dismissal returned to their jobs Oct. 3. Rather than a single, united opposition, at least four anti-government parties have emerged while the more radical students, who spearheaded the demonstrations, are fleeing to the Thai-Burmese border to get guerrilla training from ethnic minority rebels. By contrast, the conservative party has the benefit of big coffers, a nationwide network built up over 26 years and a body of loyalists who stand to lose sizable perks should the opposition win. Despite efforts to officially divorce the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from the government, analysts agree it is a major instrument of the military-backed leadership. Prior to the current upheavals the party, then known as the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, claimed that more than 14 million out of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 38 million people were members of either the party or its affiliates. <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> and others say the leadership's weak spot is the shattered economy and dependence on foreign aid to mount a revival. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which supplies about 80 percent of foreign loans and grants, and other donors have frozen assistance but whether <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> choses to use its considerable clout to shape events inside <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> remains uncertain. `` This is a lever the military has to cope with. If anything can now leverage the situation it's going to be the need for outside assistance,'' <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Judge Seals Klan Verdict After Plaintiff Seeks to Drop Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has sealed a jury's verdict in a $ 1.5 million damage suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> while he considers a city council member's decision to withdraw as the chief plaintiff. In a rambling explanation to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, longtime civil rights activist and City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Wednesday he had lost sleep worrying about the blue-collar defendants `` who have nothing but their homes, their cars and their paychecks. ... I could not disrupt their families.'' The suit seeks $ 1 million in punitive damages against two <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> groups as corporations. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> also asked the jury to return heavy individual damages: $ 200,000 against <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, grand dragon of the Southern White Knights; and $ 100,000 each against <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> grand dragon of the Invisible Empire; the group's former grand dragon, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, a veteran of several white supremacist groups and an associate of <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s. But state Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, D-Atlanta, who joined the lawsuit in July, objected to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' attempt to halt the trial, resulting in a hectic day of legal maneuvering while jurors were deliberating a verdict. The suit charged that leaders of the Klan groups conspired to disrupt a Jan. 17, 1987, `` brotherhood march'' by civil rights activists in <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and violate the marchers' civil rights. Participants in the march were pelted with rocks, bottles and other debris thrown from people who were among a large group of counterdemonstrators who gathered in the virtually all-white county north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A week later, more than 20,000 people descended upon <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in a huge civil rights march that drew national attention. <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> ordered that the verdict, delivered to the courtroom shortly before 5 p.m., be sealed in an envelope. He dismissed the six jurors with orders that they not discuss their verdict with anyone. He did not tell them why their verdict was sealed. <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> ordered a hearing today with <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, who brought the lawsuit on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> and 55 other marchers pelted with rocks and bottles; and attorneys for the two <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> organizations, their leaders and other defendants. <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> did not discuss the subject of the hearing, but defense attorneys told the court they will file motions to reopen the trial in order to question <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>. The jury, which included one black member, began its deliberations at Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he was torn by conscience as a believer in `` redemption'' and `` forgiving your enemies,'' saying <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would approve. Defense attorney <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said it was a `` noble, chivalrous and Christian gesture.''

<HEAD>President Says Industrialized Countries Beginning to Understand
Debt Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> says there are `` slight and tenuous signs'' that the industrialized countries are beginning to understand the problem of the debt owed them by developing nations. The question is whether that understanding will lead to solutions to the problem, the outgoing president said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> also said that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will respond to the stronger showing by opposition parties in July 6 general elections and become a `` more democratic country.'' De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, 54, leaves office Dec. 1. His Institutional Revolutionary Party has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929 and will continue to do so under president-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has been a leader in demanding better debt payment conditions for the Third World but at the same time has maintained <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s commitment to pay. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has renegotiated its debt and made service payments of more than $ 75 billion in the past six years that <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> has been president. But the principal is $ 104 billion, a few billion more than when de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> took office. Pointing to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as an example, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said debtor nations must `` set our house in order internally'' with economic measures and `` demand at the same time a fair and realistic deal from creditors.'' He said some world leaders and banks now realize that the debt affects the entire world economy. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> insists on joint responsibility of debtor and creditor for the debt,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must `` modernize while retaining its principles but become more efficient'' in working with the grass-roots membership. However, the opposition leftist and rightist parties also `` must realize the times they live in and update their ideology, change tactics and present articulate programs to the people,'' he said. He said the `` relative strengthening of the opposition is a small price to pay for the strengthening of political pluralism.'' Political reforms de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> initiated led to greater opposition representation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Relaxed and smiling easily during the interview, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> recalled that when he took office the country had just $ 100 million in reserves. Citizens were disenchanted with a political system, which though stable, was fraught with corruption. The world oil price collapse had shattered Mexican dreams of abundance of citizens told two years earlier that they were on their way to prosperity. There is general agreement that the stocky, unpretentious president who dealt out strong economic medicine held together a country on the verge of social conflict six years ago. `` The most serious problem at the time was the lack of confidence of Mexicans in themselves and the conflict between social groups. My concern was to maintain peace and individual freedoms while trying to obtain a social consensus,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> enacted measures that eliminated many subsidies. Prices went up and salaries lost more than half their buying power. He was accused of favoring the elite. Through the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> dominance of labor unions, he kept protests down and eventually got labor, government and private business to agree on a wage and price control plan that reduced inflation to an estimated 50 percent for this year, down from 159.2 percent in 1987. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> brought <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> into the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, opening <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s markets and forcing its manufacturers to compete. The manufacturing industry's exports in 1972 paid for only 26 percent of its imports. In 1987, they paid for 98 percent of the imports. International dollar reserves climbed to $ 15 billion this year as non-oil exports made up for the large drop in petroleum income. `` I am satisfied that some progress was made,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said. But he acknowledged things will not be easy for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Much Of Nation Without Electricity Due To Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Utility workers stayed off their jobs today, cutting off electricity and lowering water supplies to much of the nation. Employees of the national power authority went on strike Wednesday night demanding higher pay. Labor Minister <PERSON> Abubakar </PERSON> <PERSON> Umar </PERSON> said he had referred the demands to the country's Industrial Court for arbitration. In <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, the water authority said it could not run its engines indefinitely on its emergency power system. The workers were demanding that the military government review both their salaries and fringe benefits as part of its plan to run the electricity authority on a commercial basis. In the past the authority has charged rates well below cost and failed to collect a large share of accounts. Many businesses and government agencies were able to operate at least marginally using emergency power systems set up to deal with frequent power failures. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, with 100 million people, is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous nation.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says he's digging in for a long battle to reclaim the television ministry and that he's not deterred by a Canadian businessman who has signed a contract to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, whose own proposal to buy back the television ministry fell through, said many obstacles remain for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, who wants to purchase the ministry's assets for $ 115 million. `` I look towards the long haul, I'm not in this for a short term. Maybe it'll be another year before we restore -LRB- PTL -RRB-, maybe it will be two years,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who left in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s court-appointed trustee, M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, announced Tuesday he had signed a contract with <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had identified other potential buyers but had not previously gone to the contract stage. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987 and must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible under an order from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> must approve any sale, and is expected to hold a hearing in about a month on <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s bid. `` There are so many obstacles that no way could I even think about all of the ramifications of all this until I hear the final gavel of the judge,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It's not over till it's over, as I've been saying,'' he said in front of the new <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tammy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> about two miles south of the Christian theme park, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems every few weeks we go through it's been sold again, and sold again,'' he said, referring to other deals that collapsed. Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> will pay $ 50 million at closing for the deal and pay the $ 65 million balance over five years. Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has not said what he plans to do with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> but that he would consider retaining its Christian theme. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> has said other bidders may still present offers directly to the bankruptcy court, but he said his recommendation gives <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s offer a strong upper hand. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had proposed a $ 172 million plan to buy the ministry's assets, but his bid lost credibility last month when he could not come up with a $ 3 million downpayment <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he was skeptical about <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s chances of making <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> profitable again. `` There's a thousand-room hotel there; I do n't know how they're going to fill it, I do n't know how anyone without national telelvison experience could fill it,'' he said

<HEAD>Wild Horses Released On Sanctuary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 40 mustangs have found a new home at a 4,300-acre wild horse sanctuary on the rugged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> range. `` We're going to do our best to make this a success for years to come,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burford </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the sanctuary and its dedication Wednesday. The horses joined about 150 others already running free on the sanctuary in an isolated southern <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> canyon. The mustangs were rounded up by the federal government from public lands across the southwestern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The wild horses in some areas were in danger of starving to death because natural food sources no longer existed. The horses also were a nuisance to private landowners. Some have been found slaughtered in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> earlier this week pledged full state support to help federal officials in their investigation of the rifle killings of nearly 300 wild horses. All the shootings occurred in remote central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> within a 40-mile stretch north of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, an isolated <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> town on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 50. Federal investigators said the horses died over a six-month period. But at the sanctuary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, state officials said they think the wild horses will be a popular tourist attraction, particularly during the state's centennial next year when attention is focused on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s frontier and western heritage. The driving force behind the sanctuary was <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, a lifelong rancher and the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> and the American Mustang. `` They're having fun,'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. `` They spend a lot of their time just running. They take off like school children.'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said he hopes to develop a wild horse museum at the sanctuary, featuring films about horses and a history of the horse in the West's development. `` I want a front porch from which you can see the horse herd along the <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is some of the most beautiful country in the West. Not enough people get to see it.''

<HEAD>Moslem Insurgents Claim Control Of Third Provincial Capital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan rebels said today they captured a third provincial capital and seized a city along the strategic Kabul-Jalalabad highway that includes a major hydroelectric plant. Spokesmen from <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance parties headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said guerrillas made significant gains against the Marxist government this week, particularly in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. A Western diplomat confirmed the fall of <LOCATION> Sharan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> province in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Three of the 29 provincial capitals now are reportedly under guerrilla control. `` Its only significance is that it's a provincial capital, nothing else,'' said <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir-Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> resistance organization. The guerrilla-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said government troops at <LOCATION> Sharan </LOCATION> were captured, but it gave no figures. Guerrillas claim to control Toloqan, the northeastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION>, and the central <LOCATION> Bamyan </LOCATION> provincial capital. <PERSON> Naser-Zia </PERSON> said Afghan guerrillas also took control of <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>, 36 miles east of the Afghan capital on the strategic Kabul-Jalalabad highway. The city has a hydroelectric plant that feeds power to the capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, he said. In other fighting, Afghan rebels said the heavily fortified military town of <LOCATION> Urgun </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> province was captured. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> group's <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> faction said the garrison town was overrun during a joint operation Wednesday involving guerrillas from the seven resistance parties, headquartered in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. A field commander with the Itihad-e-Islami resistance group said the fall of <LOCATION> Urgun </LOCATION> gives the guerrillas full control of <LOCATION> Pakitika </LOCATION> province. `` Urgun is considered the most strategic district in <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION>,'' said a guerrilla spokesman. `` It is very important, as control of <LOCATION> Urgun </LOCATION> allows control of the most strategic roads to north and central <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' The U.S.-supported Afghan guerrillas have been fighting the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government for the past 10 years. Soviet soldiers, who entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to prop up the embattled Communist government in December 1979, began leaving in May. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> provides for the complete withdrawal of about 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops by Feb. 15.

 Arab gunmen today fatally shot two <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including a village elder gunned down while driving with his children, radio reports and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Also today, the Moslem fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> called for an end to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> infighting, indicating that it has healed its rift with the PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the Uprising. `` We must be united despite the differences in our beliefs,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> said in an underground leaflet distributed in the occupied lands. `` We are ... against any kind of split.'' The rapprochement came after several meetings between the two groups in the past two weeks, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly has challenged the leadership of pro-PLO groups in orchestrating the uprising. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> staged a successful general strike in defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Two sons of the slain village leader, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old, were wounded in the attack in <LOCATION> Biddya </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, military sources and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The dead mukhtar, or traditional village leader, was ambushed by gunmen while driving his car. He was identified as 46-year-old <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON>. Witnesses said the elder's body was set on fire with his car after the attack. The army confirmed the death and clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> Biddya </LOCATION>, 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The radio said troops arrested several Palestinian suspects. Military sources said there had been past attempts on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON>'s life, including a gun attack in August The second Palestinian, 25-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahour </PERSON>, was sprayed with gunfire in a cafe in the Israeli Arab village of <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahm </LOCATION>, where he had been in hiding since being chased out of the nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Amin </LOCATION>, the radio and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. The radio said <PERSON> Sahour </PERSON> was struck by six pistol shots. The deaths raised to nine the number of suspected collaborators killed since the Arab uprising began nearly 10 months ago. Underground leaders have ordered Palestinians to attack all Arabs cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In all, 283 Palestinians have been killed since Dec. 8, the beginning of the rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Six Israelis have also been killed. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded two Palestinians during clashes in the <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials at the city's <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. The army clamped curfews on <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> refugee camps of Shati and Bureij. The clashes came during a general strike observed throughout the coastal <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in memory of four Palestinian guerrillas killed a year ago in a shootout with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The four, members of the Moslem fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, were shot to death Oct. 6, 1987 when they refused to stop at an army roadblock in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, two <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> troops were injured when a firebomb smashed into their jeep in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. One soldier suffered moderate to serious burns and the other was slightly injured. Troops shot and wounded 14 Palestinians in clashes Wednesday and a 23-year-old Palestinian from the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp died of wounds he suffered a week earlier.

 The heated vice presidential debate exchange over <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s invocation of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is drawing strong partisan reaction, with Democrats denouncing the `` audacity'' of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator and backers of the Republican ticket accusing <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of `` a cheap shot. Politicians followed party lines in their reaction to Wednesday night's confrontation between the hand-picked candidates for vice president. Backers of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a landslide winner, while supporters of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were equally effusive about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said today that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` looked like <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> playing <LOCATION> Karnac </LOCATION>; he started with the answers and looked for the questions. So when you judge the top of the ticket, judge them by the people they select.'' On the other side, Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> said that both <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> showed `` they can serve as president if necessary'' but that the focus would now return to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` As much as the Democrats are trying to suggest that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not going to serve if elected, he is,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. Both commented on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today.'' Debate coaches gave the edge to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, with one calling the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> exchange the point that turned the clash in the Texan's favor <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the director of forensics at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a member of a panel of experts who judged the debate for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said `` I thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> really held his own until we got to the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> question. It was like a father putting down a child. I thought the momentum turned then.'' The dramatic highlight of the 90-minute debate occurred at the midpoint when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his qualifications for high office were equal to those of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> when he was elected president in 1960. Like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has served eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> snapped. `` That was really uncalled for,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> retorted. Replied <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: `` You're the one that was making the comparison, senator ... and I did not think the comparison was well taken.'' `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has the audacity to compare himself to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` You saw <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> throw a right cross that dropped him to the canvas.'' `` I think it was a cheap shot,'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said of the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> jibe. `` That was very unbecoming of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state auditor and the state's highest ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> official, praised both debaters. `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is obviously mature, well informed,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came across as quite bright, alert. I think he did an excellent job of dispelling concern people had over his candidacy.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` made a terrible mistake with the jab on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I think most people thought that was unnecessary and quite rude.'' `` It threw a chill over the whole debate, a sour note,'' said Atlanta-based pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. `` It changed from then on, the way you looked at <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> also used the man-boy analogy, to describe the Kennedy exchange. `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> came through as the man and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came through as the boy,'' he said. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, whose family was subjected to intense investigation after her Democratic vice presidential nomination four years ago, laughingly disagreed with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s contention that he was the most-investigated candidate in history. `` He's young, but he's not that young; he's got to remember 1984,'' she said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' Field said he thought <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did so well people might wish he were at the top of the Democratic ticket rather than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` It may be a mixed blessing to the Democratic ticket,'' he said. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> took a similar view, saying, `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> makes <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> look weak.'' <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said `` I think <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did a better job. I think the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket ought to be helped by his performance.'' But he also praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who, he said, `` performed well enough that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign will not have to engage in extensive damage control after tonight. But I think he was out-debated by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, called the debate a draw. `` I do n't see that one outshone the other particularly,'' she said. `` I think they came off pretty well as they intended. Whether the voters won, I'm still trying to figure out.''

<HEAD>Woman Sues Ex-Husband For Filling Out Questionnaire In Her Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman has sued her ex-husband, claiming he filled out her class reunion questionnaire with defamatory information, including that one of her hobbies is `` looking for new and wealthier husbands.'' In a suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> alleges that her former husband, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> of <PERSON> Willernie </PERSON>, received the high school class reunion questionnaire and sent it back with false allegations. The responses were published in a reunion publication and seen by 100 former classmates, according to the suit. Under the heading `` Achievements Most Proud Of,'' <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> wrote, according to the suit, `` My three divorces and how each time I married into more money to the point where I am now living on the $ 400,000 settlement and interest from my third divorce.'' The suit also said <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> wrote that his ex-wife's hobbies were night clubbing, partying and looking for new and wealthier husbands. Under the heading `` Secret Ambition or Fantasy,'' the suit claims <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> wrote: `` Seeing if I ca n't get married as many times as <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and gain my riches through divorces instead of working.'' <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The reunion committee for Silver's class of 1958 sent out questionnaires last spring asking for information to be included in a publication for former classmates, the suit said. Silver, who now lives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, claims the questionnaire fell into <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON>'s hands when it was mailed to her old address in <LOCATION> Willernie </LOCATION>. She is seeking in excess of $ 50,000 in damages, claiming the false allegations have caused her a loss of reputation.

<TEXT>
 New Yorkers already accustomed to subway ads for hemorrhoid ointments, roach killers and AIDS prevention will see a graphic ad opposing aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that had been rejected here and elsewhere as inflammatory. The advertisement shows a photograph of a dead man lying in a pool of blood on a Salvadoran street. `` What are your tax dollars buying in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>?'' it asks. The company that controls subway ad contracts for the city had rejected it last spring on the grounds that it was `` inflammatory'' and `` offensive.'' The ad finally went up in every fourth subway car this week after the organization behind it threatened legal action and the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> decided the ad did not violate its standards of good taste. The ad is sponsored by Winning Democracy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based coalition of organizations that opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. All told, producing and renting the space for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ad is costing Winning Democracy about $ 20,000, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Elia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> spokesman for the group. The coalition is placing similar ads in buses and subways throughout the country. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the ads are due in a month or two. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, they will be going up this week. They are up already in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The company that arranges ad contracts for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' buses has so far refused to accept the ads, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Waymire </PERSON>, who represents the Winning Democracy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> campaign in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an April rejection letter from the private firm that handles subway ad contracts for the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> stated that the ad was `` inflammatory'' and could `` encourage vandalism'' by riders who might be tempted to tear it down. In another letter, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firm </ORGANIZATION> cited a provision in its contract with the city under which ads may be rejected if they are `` deemed offensive to good taste.'' `` But they have all sorts of offensive things advertised in the subway _ cockroach ads, ads about AIDS, about abortion, about incest,'' <PERSON> D'Elia </PERSON> said `` We think that's great that they put these other signs up. But we were totally befuddled that we could n't put our signs up.'' At no cost to Winning Democracy, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, a lawyer who specializes in civil liberties, agreed to challenge the rejection of the ad as a violation of the constitutional right to freedom of expression. `` The First Amendment applies to public forums, and the subways in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are public forums,'' he said. `` The Winning Democracy people have a right to express their viewpoints and to reach out to their fellow citizens.'' The conflict was resolved without a lawsuit after <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> contacted the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION>. `` When we reviewed it, we did n't find it to be objectionable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>. `` We have the final say on these things.'' <PERSON> Davila </PERSON> said the subway ad firm is supposed to submit any rejected advertisement to the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> for final review, but failed to do so in this case. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Apfelbaum </PERSON>, president of the firm, did not return phone calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> seeking comment. As compensation for the delay in accepting the ad, it will run for two months for the price of one, <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping the ad will get the public debating again about what's happening in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> D'Elia </PERSON>. `` We're trying to expose the policy of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government support for what we consider a brutal military dictatorship.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent nearly $ 3 billion in military and economic aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> during the last eight years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says the aid has resulted in democratic and economic reforms. But opponents say the aid has bolstered military control of the country and that human-rights abuses and killings by death squads are rampant. The ads, designed by internationally renowned artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldessari </PERSON>, supply a phone number that readers can call for more information. The ads, in English and Spanish, will reach an estimated 4.5 million New Yorkers, said <PERSON> D'Elia </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Agreement Near On U.S. Bases, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Philippine and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said today they have narrowed differences over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases here and are nearing agreement on their status through 1991. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> gave the assessment after a 45-minute meeting, which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official described as a `` very good talk.'' Filipino and American panels began talks last April on the status of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations. But the talks have stalled over compensation and other issues. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting that Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> and Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> met Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the bases talks. `` Progress is being made and the hope was there for an early agreement,'' he said. In a statement to Filipino reporters later, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she received a call from <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> today and that `` he sounded very optimistic and confident.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains the bases under a 1947 agreement that expires in 1991. The current talks are to determine compensation and other issues through the final two years of the agreement. After that, any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refuses to say whether she will support an extension. Also today, leaders of a new party backing <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> pushed through a plan to reorganize the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> but agreed to maintain an alliance with other coalition members. The move would give the party, the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino, clear control of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as the majority party and force other rival but non-opposition parties to accept their minority status, politicians said. After a closed-door meeting of pro-Aquino legislators, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> announced that a majority voted to reorganize <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees and that at least five chairmen had tendered `` courtesy resignations.'' He said party leaders would continue meeting to decide on a system of apportioning chairmanships of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 43 committees. The reorganization was expected to be completed next week, he said. Creation of the party triggered so much realignment within the coalition that the new group wound up the biggest pro-administration party with 158 of the 203 seats in the House. It has seven seats in the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Study: Abortion Rate Higher Among Catholics Than Protestants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mixed feelings about contraceptives among Catholic women could explain why a study found their abortion rate is 30 percent higher than that of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> women, said the president of a private reproductive health foundation. `` Religion appears to play some role in the abortion decision but not in the expected direction,'' wrote <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the study. The findings emerged from two separate national surveys conducted by the New York-based institute in 1987 and 1988. `` The groups which have the most ambivalence about the use of contraceptives probably do n't use contraceptives as well as other groups in the population,'' said the study, released Wednesday. Contraception, as well as abortion, is forbidden by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nearly one-third of all women who choose abortion report a fear of others discovering that they had become pregnant,'' the study said. `` Catholic women are more likely than those of other denominations to choose abortion for this reason.'' The abortion rate among Catholic women is also higher than that among Jewish women, it said. Women who describe themselves as `` born-again'' or evangelical Christians were half as likely as other women to have abortions, the study said. The study arrived at its conclusions by comparing the number of women of each religion among abortion patients to the number of women of that religion in the general public. According to the study, nearly three of every 100 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women aged 15 to 44 had an abortion last year, a figure that remained constant for a decade. The abortion rate among Hispanic women was 4.3 per 100, while the rate among non-Hispanic white women was 2.3 per 100. Non-white women, most of whom were black, had an abortion rate of 5.3 per 100. Women who said they were Roman Catholics had an abortion rate that was about the same as the American average of 3 per 100. The rates among women who described themselves as Protestant or Jewish were 30 percent below the national average. `` It is not clear how the effects of religious affiliation are influenced by other socioeconomic factors, or, for that matter, by differences in the use of contraception which affect the need to make a decision about abortion,'' <PERSON> Rosoff </PERSON> added. About half of the women having abortions became pregnant because their contraceptive method failed or because they used it incorrectly. In both surveys, the researchers noted that women increasingly must work outside the home for economic reasons, and that to do so they must have an adequate education. `` Both of these aims can be threatened by an accidental pregnancy, not only among young, unmarried women, but also among older, married women,'' the study said. One study surveyed 1,900 women nationwide who had abortions in 30 facilities. The other queried nearly 10,000 women who obtained abortions during 1987 at 103 clinics, hospitals and doctors' offices in all regions of the country <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tew </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the institute, said the margin of error was not available.

<HEAD>Rowan Says Gun-Possession Trial Hasn't Changed His Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said his inconclusive trial on weapons-possession charges, which have been dropped, did not alter his views on gun control. `` I never said I would n't use whatever was at hand to repel -LRB- an invader -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said Wednesday after <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> authorities announced they were dropping the charges. `` I did it in that case, and I would do it again.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> had been charged with using an unregistered handgun and ammunition in shooting a teen-ager who took an unauthorized dip in his pool last June. A two-day trial led to a hung jury. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has used his columns to speak out in favor of gun control, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, he still supported enacting a federal law `` that makes it extremely difficult for anyone but a law-enforcement officer to have a gun.'' He added: `` I have never said that I would not own a gun, or that I wo n't in the future.'' The teen-ager who was shot, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that he does n't understand the district's reasoning. `` I guess it's the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> coming through again,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` From the start, I thought that if anyone tried to kill somebody that they should be charged with assault,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It's all politics.'' A District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that heard the weapons charges against <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> became deadlocked in deliberations last Thursday, and a mistrial was declared. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> corporation counsel, said the city decided not to seek a new trial. `` While I continue to believe that Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, in fact and in law, committed the offenses for which he was prosecuted ... the district's ability to obtain a fair hearing in this matter has been undermined,'' <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe either Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> or the government in this case can get a unanimous verdict.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said the gun he fired was given to him by his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The son testified during the two-day trial that he had repeatedly been rebuffed in his efforts to register the .22 caliber pistol with city police officials in 1982 and 1983. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent at the time he asked about registration requirements, testified that officers in the police department's gun control unit told him he was exempt from registration requirements because he was a law enforcement officer. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also claimed that the same officers told him it would be `` no problem'' if others in his family had access to the weapon.

 Photographer <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> <PERSON> Pran </PERSON>, who barely escaped <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s killing fields, denounced the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to be seated as part of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> delegation. `` I am still shocked when I see the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> flag on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> territory. How would you feel if you were Jewish and you saw <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s flag flying at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>?'' <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> said Wednesday to a crowd of about 250 demonstrators. In 1975, when the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> toppled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s government, <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> was trapped in the country. Like most of the population, he endured famine and forced labor on a collective farm, but managed to escape to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in 1979. <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> is now a photographer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. His ordeal, and that of his people, received worldwide attention in the movie `` The Killing Fields.'' About 2 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to impose agrarian communism from 1975 to 1979. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ousted <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime Wednesday's protest coincided with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s speech to the 43rd General Assembly, with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> sharing a seat in the delegation. The vigil was organized by the <LOCATION> Oxfam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> relief agency. <ORGANIZATION> Oxfam </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammock </PERSON> and several of its officers began a three-day fast Wednesday to protest the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> membership in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no justice yet,'' said <PERSON> Dith </PERSON>, his voice strained with anger. `` Justice and peace have n't come to my country. ... I want to see the Cambodians happy. I want to see Cambodians smiling again.'' In an effort to root all Western influence out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> renamed 1975 `` Year Zero,'' and sent city-dwellers to work on collective farms. <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> was among the forced laborers until he escaped across the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border to a refugee camp. <ORGANIZATION> Oxfam </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dith </PERSON>, and many Cambodians fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the best armed of the three groups fighting the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, will seize power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw 50,000 of its 120,000 occupation troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> this year and that all are to be out by late 1989 or early 1990. Many people fear the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will fill the military and political void left by the retreating Vietnamese. The resistance coalition also includes the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Samm </PERSON> and forces loyal to former Cambodian head of state Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter and international law, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says it can not recognize a government imposed on a country by outside force, such as the current Cambodian government installed by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>.

 Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON>, an American who served as doctor for <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and became the first non-Chinese citizen of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has died of cancer. He was 78. <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiuju </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> died Monday morning. Family members said there would be a public viewing of the body on Monday. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON>, who was born in 1910 to poor <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> immigrants in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is largely credited with organizing programs to eradicate venereal disease in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and reduce cases of leprosy by 80 percent. He was a senior adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> since 1979 and sat on the government's top advisory body, the Chinese Peoples' Political Consultative Conference. Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sample, president of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, said in a statement that `` over the past half-century, he led the fight against dreadful diseases like cholera, venereal disease and leprosy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and in the process saved the lives of many millions of Chinese.'' After graduating from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> studied medicine at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and received his medical degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION>. In 1933, he and two other doctors went to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to study tropical medicine. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the rest of his life. `` All around me were poverty, malnutrition and exploitation,'' <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> said in a 1983 interview. `` I found the social evils of old <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were more fatal to the poor than illness. The problem was not only medical but political.'' <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> said in 1984 that he first read <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>'s Communist Manifesto in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>: `` Its impact on me was immediate. I thought then, and think now, that the poorer you are, the more easily you understand the Manifesto. In 1936, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, the journalist-author of the classic `` Red Star over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' answered <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s call for a `` Western-trained doctor and an honest journalist.'' They made their way through Nationalist lines to join the Communists in their northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stronghold. For the next 13 years, until the Communist triumph, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> served as medical adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In 1950, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> became the first non-Chinese citizen of the new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He took on the Chinese name of <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Haide </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haide </PERSON> means `` virtue from across the seas.'' In 1953, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> helped organize the Dermatology and <ORGANIZATION> Venereology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and by the end of the decade, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claimed that once-pandemic syphilis and gonorrhea had been eliminated. Venereal disease has again become a minor problem in recent years as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s open-door policy increases contacts with the outside world In the 1960s, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> turned to a new program to control leprosy, with a goal of eradicating the disease, which still afflicts about 70,000 Chinese, by the year 2000. His death had not yet been reported in the tightly controlled official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> press, possibly because it occurred during Chinese National Day holidays. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> is survived by his wife of 50 years, <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> Sufei </PERSON>; a son; a daughter; a sister; and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>New Law Bans Smoking by Police, Firefighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state law banning new police officers and firefighters from smoking at home or at work goes into effect today, and union officials predicted that it would be challenged in court the first time it is enforced. `` Someone is going to question the constitutionality of putting restrictions on people at home,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>. The penalty for lighting up is dismissal. The union says it is strongly opposed to the law. Several public safety unions agreed to the law after current police officers and firefighters were exempted from the no-smoking regulation. The exemption also applies to people who took a qualifying exam or were already on a civil service hiring list before the measure was adopted. The regulation was passed as part of a pension reform bill and its justification is economic. State law holds that any heart or lung disease contracted by firefighters or police officers is a job-related disability. The state could save large sums of money by reducing smoke-related heart-lung ailments by keeping smokers off the forces.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new ideology chief said socialism must learn from the West and try the kind of bold economic experiments President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proposed. In his first major speech since being catapulted onto the ruling Politburo, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said some of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have fostered abuses, but in general he showed himself a closer ally of the Soviet leader than his predecessor as ideology chief, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. Some Western diplomatic analysists had predicted <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, seen as a reform economist, would be charged with redefining socialism to incorporate <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pragmatic approach to rebuilding the Soviet economy. His remarks, published Wednesday in the newspapers Pravda and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to begin that process. But he took a cautious first step. `` Unfortunately, there have been some irresponsible attempts to cast a shadow over <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s inheritance, over the basic values of socialism,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` And how else can those statements appearing in the press be interpreted that claim that the command-administrative system resulted from <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, those attempts to deny the socialist nature of our system, that even doubt the rightness of our choice for socialism?'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, 59, a political economist by training, was named to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> on Friday by the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and was named to head a newly created commission on ideology He spoke Tuesday to an international conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the problems of contemporary socialism. In his reported remarks, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> showed himself more open to following the Western example to help solve Soviet problems than was <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the Politburo member reputed to be a conservative opponent of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But some Soviets who read <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s speech in the national press said it was impossible to conclude that the newest Politburo member had completely embraced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform agenda. The party's new ideology chief spoke of the need for `` deep qualitative rejuvenation'' in socialism, and said the solution to some Soviet problems could come from other socialist countries, and even from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` While the socialist perspective is being worked out, the experience of humanity as a whole can not be ignored, including the non-socialist part of the world,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` I'm referring not only to the scientific and technical achievements of the system that is opposed to us, but to many forms of organization of public life, of the economic process.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> also urged a rethinking of the role of central planning and the market, and voiced support for two pillars of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for `` perestroika,'' or nationwide restructuring: leasing farmland to individual farmers and spreading economic cooperatives to provide consumer goods that are lacking in the state sector <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, in an Aug. 5 speech, said the class struggle determines international relations. But <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> hewed more closely to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s line, which maintains that in the nuclear age, East and West must cooperate to solve common problems. `` The conception is outdated that socialism and capitalism can develop in a parallel way,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` On the contrary, their ways will inevitably intersect, both systems will inevitably interact within the framework of the same human civilization.''

 Italian politicians rose to their feet in Parliament today and applauded the news that <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> rejected Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bid to extend his presidency until 1997. The reaction was similar in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where lawmakers hailed the decision by voters to reject <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in Wednesday's national referendum. Open elections are to be held next year for the first time since 1970. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s Socialist government was `` pleased about the advance of the democratic opposition ... and will salute with complete satisfaction their final predominance.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the government was encouraged. `` We hope that the plebiscite result, which appears to reflect the will of the Chilean people, will represent an important first step on the path back towards full democracy,'' a statement said. The West German government called on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military leaders to abide by terms for the nation's democratization. `` We hope that the government will now hold to its own promised timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free elections,'' said government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON>. Italian Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, said: `` The government over which I am presiding pledges to be near the Chilean people in the difficult struggle for the conquest of democracy.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, also a Christian Democrat, said in a statement that `` the victory of the opposition is very important. The historic tradition of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is democratic.'' <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was the scene of numerous demonstrations when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a 1973 coup that ousted President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. Through the years, many Chileans have taken exile in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON>, a foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was among 500 foreigners called to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> by opposition groups there to act as election observers. `` It's a tremendous triumph for democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, a totally unique situation where a dictator has been voted out in a plebiscite,'' <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON> said. `` It is absolutely crucial now to ensure that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> fully accepts the decision of the Chilean people,'' he said. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, a lawmaker in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was not without support. `` The most important thing is that despite all the cards against him, particularly on human rights, this old man of 72 achieved a considerable vote,'' he said. All Spanish political parties represented in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> hailed the referendum's outcome. `` The triumph of the ` no' -LRB- vote -RRB- represents the rejection by the majority of a dictatorial regime and the process that the regime designed to perpetuate its hold on power,'' a statement from the governing Spanish Socialist party said. Spanish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said `` the people of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> have given a great lesson of political maturity.'' <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a former premier, called the vote `` an immense victory, after 15 years of dictatorship and suffering.'' <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said on French radio the result was `` a great day'' for <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. `` It's a country which suffered terribly for 15 years ... and now, all of a sudden, there is light and hope again,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the referendum result showed that in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and elsewhere `` man triumphs as he fights for liberty and the respect of his fundamental rights.'' <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheysson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s commissioner for North-South matter, also urged Chilean authorities to restore democracy as quickly as possible.

<HEAD>Approval Near on Plan To Close Unneeded Military Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is nearing approval of a proposal that finally may overcome strong political opposition and save millions of dollars by closing unneeded military bases. `` There's no question the issue of closing bases is very difficult politically,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Closed bases mean lost jobs, and nobody in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likes to lose jobs.'' `` This is a one-shot proposition,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` You've got an opportunity to do this because we're changing administrations and there's a sense this could be done fairly now.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> spoke late Wednesday, shortly after <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators agreed on the complicated details of a bill that could mean the first major base closings since 1977. Final floor approval by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is likely later this week, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> agreed. The bill could mean that up to 25 of the nation's 550 largest bases could be shut down starting in 1990, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> declined to estimate a number, saying, `` I do n't know what they'll come up with. The measure creates a 12-member commission which would have until Dec. 31 to send <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> a recommended list of bases. He would have to either accept or reject the entire list by Jan. 15, only five days before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office. A 10-member commission has been at work for five months, preparing its findings. The two new members would be added to that panel. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> objects to the list, it could only block the closings by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval next spring of a bill killing the plan, but that bill could be vetoed by the new president. `` It's much better for an outgoing administration, an outgoing secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, to take that responsibility,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` He's going to make a lot of enemies, politically. We have a person now who is willig to take that heat.'' Pentagon officials have estimated that between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion a year could be saved if they are allowed to close outdated bases. But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> disputed that figure. The $ 5 billion estimate is `` financial hyperbole,'' he said, predicting savings of several hundred million dollars a year. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> declined to estimate. `` I think the savings may be very significant, but I do n't know yet what the figures will be.'' Military bases mean jobs, and since 1977, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has enacted a stiff, complex series of laws which effectively have blocked the Pentagon from closing any of the 3,800 military installations in the contintental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the 550 larger bases. Those laws would be waived by the current proposal. Until 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> generally had been allowed to have its way on base closings, particularly in the years after World War II when the nation's large military machine was being mothballed. Between 1961 and 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> closed 3,600 installations. The change came after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposed closing Loring Air Force Base in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. That state's congressional delegation blocked the plan by by winning approval of legislation requiring long and costly environmental studies, an action followed later by other legislators. The current commission is headed by former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., and former Sen. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. `` Politically, they have a very difficult job, and they have to be astute,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> `` The list they come up with has to be politically balanced. It ca n't have too many from one area of the country, like the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and too few from another area. And it has to be perceived as being equally divided in terms of hurting Democratic and Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

 A student who failed an economics test twice has filed a lawsuit seeking to force the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> to award her a master's degree in business administration or refund her $ 5,000 tuition. <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 48, claims she earned her master's degree with good grades in her classwork, although she could n't pass a final test. `` After paying all my dues and having a good -LRB- grade point -RRB- average I just feel abused,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` I really do n't want their money. I just want what I earned, which is a master's degree. The economics test is a required review of all four elements of the material: finance, management, marketing and economics. Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> passed the three other parts of the test but failed the economics section. She hired a tutor, crammed for another semester and took the test again. She failed again. She filed the lawsuit last week with the help of her husband <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, who is a lawyer. She claims the test is unfair because the school's economics professors hold different economic theories and place emphasis on different areas of the subject. Her test was prepared by a professor she did not study under and included material she had never studied, Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> contends. Dean <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> of the university's College of Business defended the test, which he said is common at colleges across the country. <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> said Tuesday it was not uncommon for students to fail the test several times and added that Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> can take it again.

<HEAD>Lawyer To Fight Genetic Test Of Child</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawyer says he will try to prevent a genetic test that could determine whether his client's 9-year-old daughter was switched at birth and is actually the child of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple. A hearing is scheduled for Friday at which the couple, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, plan to ask a judge to order that the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl produce a blood sample. `` You ca n't just allow people to come in with suspicions and demand blood tests,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, a lawyer for the father, said Wednesday. The Twiggs contend their healthy newborn daughter was swapped nearly 10 years ago for a sickly one at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION>. The child they raised, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died of heart problems Aug. 23, shortly after a genetic test determined she was not biologically related to the couple, the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> said. The Twiggs filed a $ 100 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>, three doctors and a nurse, alleging fraud and negligence. They also have said they want to find and regain custody of their biological daughter. That search has focused on another blue-eyed blonde who, according to state records, was born at <LOCATION> Hardee </LOCATION> three days before Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> gave birth. The couple believe their real daughter now lives in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ginbsurg </PERSON> said his client is certain he is the biological father and intends to keep the girl he has raised and loved for 10 years regardless of what a test would show. A genetic test `` ca n't make him feel any more the father,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said, `` and I ca n't see how it will do us any good.'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said the couple has not presented convincing evidence that the Twiggs are the true parents and deserve a blood test. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, an attorney for the couple, said no firm evidence is required to bring a court action to determine paternity.

Aides to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> described the confrontation in this town, a traditional stronghold of the rival right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, as the worst of the campaign for the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. Security guards subdued one man who tried to throw a tomato at <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, while scores of youths in blue and white <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> shirts shoved their way toward <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>.

Aides said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was upset by the pushing and shoving today in the <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> market, although he showed no signs of it as he walked stony-faced in shirt sleeves through the town of 46,000, several miles from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` It demonstrates a certain style that a better part of the Israeli people do not like to see,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the 40-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected a bid by right-wing parties to disqualify a leftist Jewish-Arab party, claiming its support for dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would undermine the Jewish state. On Wednesday, the board disqualified U.S.-born right-wing extremist <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> from running in the elections, saying his calls to expel <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> were racist and illegal. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> is appealing the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' colleague, Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>, proposed Wednesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> remove troops from certain Arab towns to cool tensions until a land-for-peace compromise could be worked out with the Palestinians. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes yielding any of the Arab lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in 1967 on the grounds that territorial concessions would endanger security. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also rejects a Labor-backed proposal to convene an international peace conference including the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be isolated in a hostile forum and forced to give up the occupied territories. Since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8, more than 280 Palestinians have been killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Six Israelis also have died.

 Officials see no sign that other American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> may be freed in the wake of a captive's release earlier this week, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. The official, who came to this city with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team to debrief the freed hostage, also said Wednesday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration assumes the kidnappers are financed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Doctors here said freed hostage <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 60-year-old Indian citizen and resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was in good spirits. But they said he faces tremendous stress as a result of his 20-month ordeal. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Master Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fick </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was resting at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> hospital had decided not hold a press conference. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has not spoken to reporters since his arrival in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The spokesman later said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> `` feels much better today'' and would be examined by a stress mananagement team, dentists, eye doctors and physical therapists. He had no further details. The debriefing team arrived in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, shortly after <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was flown from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> early Wednesday. Debriefing began that day and continued today. The group hopes to gain new information from him on the status of nine Americans missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. After arriving in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educators abducted with him and remaining in captivity were `` OK.'' Armed men dressed as policemen took <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> hostage Jan. 24, 1987, on the <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> campus in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, along with Americans <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> All four taught at the school. A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility and said it freed <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as a goodwill gesture. He arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> two days after his release in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. His freedom sparked hopes for release of the 16 foreign hostages still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. However, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official painted a gloomy picture at a news conference at the hospital Wednesday. `` One wants to be encouraged that they will be released, but we really do n't know,'' said the official. `` There are no indications that others are coming out,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expert when asked about the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The official, an expert on hostage issues, requested anonymity, although he was speaking at a news conference before several dozen journalists. Television crews were ordered not to film the comments. Characterizing the kidnappers, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said: `` It is our opinion that they are under the influence of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and are part of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella organization for several pro-Iranian groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Later, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official elaborated: `` There are indications that they -LRB- the hostage-takers -RRB- are backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, we assume financed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was being examined at the <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> hospital. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, the hospital chief, told Wednesday's news conference that said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has told officials he wants to return to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> after his medical tests. He once taught at the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 A spokesman for the commission now sponsoring the second presidential debate says it is seeking a new location because the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> held the original debate site in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` hostage.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, director of media arrangements for the Commission on Presidential Debates, said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> was demanding $ 90,000 in payments before releasing the Shrine Auditorium in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said the commission still wants the second and final debate between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be held in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But the League on Wednesday moved to secure the hall by placing a $ 40,000 deposit on it _ two days after the group announced it was backing out as sponsor of the debate in a dispute over control of format and staging details, he said. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said the League was demanding repayment of the deposit plus $ 50,000 reimbursement for expenses before releasing the hall to the bipartisan commission for the debate, to be held Oct. 13 or Oct. 14, depending on the length of the Major League Baseball playoffs. `` What they're telling us is they're willing to spend $ 40,000 to keep the hall empty,'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> for the vice presidential debate, said. `` We consider that holding the hall hostage,'' he said. `` We're not going to deal with them. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Drea </PERSON> said <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>'s allegations were `` absurd'' and `` an unfortunate ploy to try to embarrass the League. She said the non-profit League was not holding the Shrine Auditorium hostage but was merely seeking reimbursement for the $ 40,000 deposit and costs of preparing the hall for the debate, including broadcast equipment and fire safety precautions. She said the commitment for the deposit was made long before the League decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the event. `` We got the ball rolling,'' she said. `` Now they can pick it up and run with it. We should be reimbursed for our very real costs that have gone into planning for that debate, and no more.'' The nationally broadcast debate was to have been sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday or Friday of next week. However, league officials, angered by refusal of the two presidential campaigns to give up control of the format and staging details, withdrew. Commission Executive Director <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> to direct commission handling of the vice presidential debate, said the commission was looking for local donors to pay for putting on the second presidential debate. She said the first debate in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, cost $ 500,000 to stage, and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> one would cost at least that much. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said he remained optimistic the debate would be held, despite the dispute over the hall.

 A team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese investigators found two sets of human remains and debris from a wrecked aircraft during an unprecedented search for the airmen missing in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, officials say. Four Americans, meanwhile, floated dollar bills down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> today to spread news of a $ 2.4 million reward for prisoners of war they say still may be alive. The group also said it would direct a remote control toy boat to the Laotian shore to carry offers of the reward. Two other Americans were arrested on a similar mission and were believed still being held Wednesday by authorities in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. One set of remains located by the U.S.-Vietnamese search team was found at the <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the remains of Vietnamese, and probably is not American, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team leader, said searchers found areas where other remains might be buried and recovered pieces of aircraft wreckage. They finished their eight-day search through five provinces near <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> specialists left Wednesday for <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, but planned to return to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss their findings and the possibility of more joint work, including excavations of crash sites. The teams trekked through steep mountains in pouring monsoon rains to reach sites where six airmen were shot down during the war, which ended in 1975. Villagers led investigators to two sets of remains, in <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> and Ha Nam Ninh provinces, said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Office For Seeking Missing Personnel Can said the remains will be given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after preliminary analysis by Vietnamese forensic experts. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> does not have equipment for identifying the teeth, the key part of both sets of remains. It was the first time <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts to probe the countryside and because it may resolve some cases <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> considers top priority among the 1,757 missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, a private group of searchers believes missing servicemen are alive in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The four Americans threw $ 25 to $ 30 into the river, which flows on to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as a `` test'' and planned to drop more than $ 2,000 in American and other currencies Friday from the Thai shore. The boat, donated by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> toy manufacturer named <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON>, is to be remote steered to the Laotian shore and left there. The speedy, 2.5-foot boat is festooned with a flag reading `` You -LRB- missing in action -RRB- are not forgotten.'' `` We are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will work,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, whose brother was listed as MIA in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> 22 years ago. The other members of the group are <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> veteran of the Vietnam War; and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, of Winter Haven, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a nurse during the war. The group is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>. Laotian authorities Sunday arrested two other members of the group, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, 43, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran from <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, after they crossed the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and landed in a Laotian village. Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> carried about $ 3,000 as well as other currency. Each bill was stamped with the reward offer. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> were being held at Ban Sing <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> in the southern <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Champasak </LOCATION>. He could not confirm whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the capital, <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today he was not worried about a poll showing that many television viewers thought he had lost Wednesday night's debate with Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to win the election. He's still way ahead in the polls,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said as he left a morning rally at his hotel. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated that many TV viewers believed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had trounced the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, asked if he was concerned about the poll, said, `` Not at all. We're still ahead.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told supporters at the rally that `` we now have a little more than four weeks left in this campaign.'' `` This election is going to be decided by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and it's going to be decided on the issues,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He headed for rallies in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and a lunch with former President Ford. After the debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator had `` absolutely no response to the fact that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is simply out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Leaving the debate Wednesday night, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator beamed at reporters and pronounced his own performance `` great.'' He insisted that he was pleased at having been grilled repeatedly by the panelists about his qualifications for national office. `` We were delighted that they brought it up three different times because it gave us three different times to talk to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people about what I'll do for the country,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The Republican vice presidential nominee received congratulatory calls after the debate from Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his running mate, `` You did great,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. At a post-debate outdoor rally Wednesday night, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told 2,000 flag-waving supporters that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` had a difficult time defending the liberal governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' `` There was absolutely no response to the fact that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is simply out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Referring to Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> playoff game in which the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> 2-1, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` This afternoon, the team from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lost, and tonight, the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lost.'' `` I feel great,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. But despite strong statements of victory by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his advisers, early indications were that many people had doubts his performance. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll of 637 viewers gave the round to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> by 51 percent to 27 percent, with a 4.5 percent margin of error. In particular, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seemed to suffer during an exchange with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s oft-stated defense of his youth and qualifications. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, said he had just as much experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did when, at 43, he ran for president. `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters outside the rally Wednesday night that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s comments were `` uncalled for,'' a charge he had made during the debate. Aides went further, calling it a `` cheap shot.'' Late Wednesday, the campaign released a statement of `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> distortions and errors.'' On the Kennedy question, the statement said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` never said he was JFK; he simply compared his age and level of experience in response to a question.'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the senator would be able to put the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> question and those about his qualifications `` behind him.'' `` We'll focus the attention on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and on the fact that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could n't defend his running mate,'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said. Despite the heated exchange between the two nominees, <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> noted that it had been <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who went over to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and initiated the closing handshake `` before <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> even left the podium.'' `` It just shows he's a bigger man than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today his running mate's debate performance was `` a real plus for us'' and he laid claim to momentum in the final weeks of the presidential race The Democratic nominee said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was `` knowledgeable and relaxed'' during the Wednesday night encounter while Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` programmed beyond belief.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> characterized <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` extremely insecure'' and lacking in `` strength, confidence or anything.'' `` This will be a real plus for us,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters as he flew to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to join <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at a rally. Before he left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign distributed a blistering analysis of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance, saying, `` Whenever Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> deviated from his well-memorized script, his answers were shallow, revealing his lack of substantive knowledge. He appeared uninformed and a stranger to basic facts on almost every issue.'' The statement noted that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked several times what he would do if suddenly thrust into the presidency, and it said that in every response, `` he failed.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took time after the Wednesday night debate between <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to join supporters and deliver his assessment of the vice presidential showdown, which he watched at home. `` The most important qualification for a vice president is that he's ready at a moment's notice to assume the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told supporters waving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flags. `` Tonight, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> demonstrated that he was the only one on that stage who's ready.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he spoke to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator after the debate. `` I could n't be prouder of him as my running mate,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` He's going to be a great vice president.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joined aides in claiming their man trounced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, particularly in demonstrating a grasp of the issues and showing presidential confidence and leadership. `` What you saw was his strength, his maturity, his vision, his toughness, his leadership _ all of the qualities that are so important in a vice president and so important in a president, so important to someone who is a heartbeat away from the presidency,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He's a great asset to our ticket.'' The Democratic nominee also said the debate offered the voters a chance to learn `` about how I make presidential decisions and the way <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes presidential decisions. My friends, tonight that was no contest.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Bentsen-Quayle debate, and his recent debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, had helped focus the campaign on the `` real concerns of mainstream Americans.'' That boded well for Democrats, he said. `` What is now beginning to happen is that with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people focused in on these two tickets, and on their concerns about the future, they understand that this is a nation that is never satisfied with the status quo and never will be. The reason we are the greatest nation in the world is that we are always moving forward, always trying to do better, always trying to build a better future.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then prompted a thunderous ovation by declaring: `` And that's why we're going to win.'' Later, he got the flags waving again by saying, `` On the 20th of January 1989, the new era of greatness arrives.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was back on the stump today after spending most of Wednesday catching up on gubernatorial business. He took a break in the early afternoon to meet with reporters, denouncing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program while dodging a question likely to come up during a Friday visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ whether he would have, like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, vetoed legislation to protect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textile industry from foreign competition. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made his criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program a staple of his campaign and has a new television ad accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of running a `` revolving door'' prison system. At the center of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks is a case in which an inmate on furlough raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman and assaulted her fiance. `` The vice president's record on crime and the fight against drugs is pathetic,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's been a failure and in my judgment this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic occurrence for political reasons. The vice president knows that the federal government has a very extensive furlough program, knows that Governor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the'70s had a very extensive furlough program and tragedies as a result of that.'' As for the textile bill, which would have placed strict new limits on imports of textiles, apparel and shoes, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he favored legislation giving five years' protection to the industry provided it agreed to modernize. There was no such provision in the bill vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said there would have been if he was president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to answer directly when asked whether he would have signed the legislation as it was presented to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also took to the airwaves with another round of ads, four 30-second spots attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his record on drug enforcement, education, the environment and Social Security.

 Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, heading to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for a reunion with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, pointed cheerfully today to polls showing he won the debate with Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and said, `` Gee, those polls were great, were n't they?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, stopping to speak with reporters as he left his hotel this morning, also said he had been angered by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s reference to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, which triggered the sharpest exchange of their debate. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee disputed any suggestion that he had appeared nasty in his response to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> over the Kennedy remark. `` What happened there was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> kept comparing himself to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and he overreached himself and I got fed up with it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. He pointed out that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was `` a war hero'' and had run a nationwide campaign before being nominated president. Asked if he was angered, he said, `` Sure, as a friend of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, I deeply resented his trying to put <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mantle over himself when he did n't have a record that compared with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> panel of veteran debate judges called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the winner by a wide margin, and an instant <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll also gave the victory to the Democratic nominee. `` Gee, those polls were great were n't they ... I was just delighted,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I knew I was scoring points and I thought I was winning, but it's difficult to be objective about yourself.'' `` I had fun,'' the nominee said after his 90-minute televised encounter with his Republican rival. `` I think we made our points.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s principle point of the evening was his stinging retort to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s assertion that he has as much experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had when he sought the presidency. `` Senator, you are no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> shot back at the 41-year-old junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> whose credentials have been challenged since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected him for the ticket. `` That was really uncalled for, senator,'' responded <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took a congratulatory phone call from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before leaving <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> after the debate, then spoke to 700 cheering supporters in a crowded hotel ballroom just down the street. He made no mention of his remark on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, which was the rhetorical and emotional high point of the contest. But he derided <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for his handling of the repeated questioning he took on his qualifications and what he would do if the presidency was thrust upon him _ and he depicted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as sticking close to his advisers' coaching. `` You know, I stood up there for 90 minutes listening to Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> say what he was going to do if he was president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I still did n't know,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` Finally I realized that all he was going to do was go back to that script again.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was making his first stop today at the <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who watched the debate back home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was flying down to join him for the one appearance. They were going their separate ways from there. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, added to the Democratic ticket amid hopes of carrying giant <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was campaigning later in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and planned to stump the state again Friday and Saturday as polls showed the Democratic ticket trailing the Republicans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by as many as 10 percentage points. As he left the debate site, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> declined reporters' shouted invitations to declare himself the winner. `` I think I did fine, and I enjoyed it,'' he said. At the rally he stood before a banner that read `` and the winner is <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' He appealed to Democrats in the farm states of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and, just across the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, saying that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` does n't even know what they're talking about'' when farm target prices are discussed. After days of intensive debate preparation, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> tried to relax Wednesday afternoon before the debate. The 67-year-old senator displayed exhuberance in a pre-debate check of the auditorium stage, lifting his wife, B.A., and carrying her off the stage. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s debate jab at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> over his Kennedy comparison was the object of much of the post-debate analysis or `` spinning,'' as the partisan commentaries from both parties are called. His Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues chortled over the tense exchange. `` I thought that was the knockout blow of the evening,'' said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranson </PERSON>. `` It was a devastating reply,'' said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. But Republcan Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> sounded wounded, saying: `` I think it was a cheap shot ... That was not the <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> know.''

<TEXT>
 The government proclaimed a state of emergency today as police fought demonstrators who have rioted in the streets for three days to protest rising prices. President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> said all civil administrative and security services were placed under military command, but the measures did not bring an immediate halt to the rioting. Arsonists set fire to several government buildings. The decision was required by `` grave developments in the situation in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>,'' Bendjedid said in a statement. He said the state of emergency was invoked under the constitution. On Wednesday evening, fire destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and Sports, the government-sponsored soccer betting agency, the town hall and numerous shops. Protesters set several more fires today, including one at a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> building. Looters were seen leaving the building, and official files were blowing around in the wind outside. Police anti-riot squads used force against groups of youths that rioted in the streets of the capital this morning to protest the 15 percent annual inflation rate. One police unit armed with shields and riot sticks launched tear gas grenades at a group of youngsters gathered near <ORGANIZATION> Algiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Previously, the anti-riot squads remained in the background during two days of unprecedented rioting in the city. It was not known today whether anyone was hurt during the rioting. An unknown number of youths were arrested on charges of looting. First estimates of the damage to the city exceeded $ 100 million. Under the government's econcomic reform program, prices for basic food staples have risen dramatically. A pound of beef sells for about $ 11.40 or more, and in some places drinking water is sold for about $ 4 a gallon. Proclamation of the state of emergency came after Bendjedid and the top members of his government met Wednesday night with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the only political party; and the leaders of the state-sponsored labor union. Rifle-toting soldiers in riot gear and steel helmets were deployed today at the harbor, the bus station, the seafront <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building, the headquarters of the ruling party, and the courtyard of the national radio and television service. The streets were almost deserted with the exception of a few cars and buses that made their way between vehicles wrecked in Wednesday's rioting. Firemen worked throughout the night to extinguish fires left by the rioters. At Bab-El-Oued, where the riots began Tuesday night, and at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Biar </LOCATION>, police squads equipped with water cannon, armored cars and police dogs stood ready, particularly near the big public schools. Witnesses said different groups of rioters seemed to aim at different targets. Groups of youngsters began the rioting with calls against the high cost of living. They were followed by older rioters who chanted Islamic slogans and seemed to aim at foreign and private businesses. Both groups were swept away by vandals dissembling and burning furniture, equipment, computers and files, and looting shops. Bendjedid, facing the most serious challenge since he came to power 10 years ago, warned Wednesday that he would `` intervene with all vigor'' against any further rioting.

<DATELINE>NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist leadership of the northern province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> said today it will resign. The announcement came after 50,000 people rallied to demand the ouster of the politicians in a deepening economic crisis. <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sogorov </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vojvodina </ORGANIZATION>, made the announcement in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> at an emergency session of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serbia </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the autonomous northern province, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was to implement the resignations at an emergency meeting this evening in this provincial capital, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, state television reported. The resignation could pave the way for wholesale changes in the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership and in the parties of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six constituent republics. Angry crowds in Novi Sad chanted `` We want resignations!'' as they gathered in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> estimated the crowds at 100,000, but an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter at the scene estimated about 50,000 people were on the streets at midafternoon. The protesters tried to force their way into the party headquarters, but cordons of police, including a riot unit, blocked their way. The crowds then moved to a larger square. Loudspeakers broadcast shouted slogans about <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s growing problems, which includes 217 percent inflation, a 15 percent unemployment rate and a $ 21 billion foreign debt. The flag-waving demonstrators chanted `` Police go away!'' `` We are going to smash windows!'' and `` We want freedom!'' and demanded the immediate resignation of the provincial Communist leadership, according to the witnesses. Communist officials who spoke were booed and jeered by the crowd, and television showed one hit with a bottle. Most factories and businesses in the city remained closed. The Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement after its emergency meeting saying the political situation in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> was deteriorating rapidly, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership has been deaf to the demands of the working class and other citizens,'' the statement said, adding, `` a serious split has occurred between the <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership and the people.'' The demonstrations in Novi Sad began about noon Wednesday and continued into the night. Protesters also chanted in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who is demanding that the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> be given stronger central authority over <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a second autonomous region under <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Serbs claim ethnic Albanians, who form a majority of the population of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, are forcing them out of the southern province. The protests in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> began just after about 5,000 workers marched on the federal Parliament in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Wednesday to voice their anger over the economic situation. In central <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, about 140,000 Serbs participated in two other rallies Wednesday to press demands for greater Serbian control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. The Novi Sad protesters, who support <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s position, were spurred by a decision taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> to reprimand two members who supported his views at an earlier rally, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. The head of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, said Tuesday that the party's 162-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> probably will vote Oct. 17 for a shake-up in the leadership of the ruling Politburo. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is facing its worst economic and political crisis since World War II, and criticism of the communist leaders is mounting for their failures to resolve the economic problems and to defuse tension between the <LOCATION> Serbs </LOCATION> and ethnic Albanians.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today proposed doubling the national budget for prison construction and developing a Cabinet-level program to combat street gangs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stuck to the text of his tough-on-crime speech before <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> supporters and made no mention of running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate Wednesday night with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> But later, while jogging at a quarter-mile track with students at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the vice president said he felt `` as good as I did last night, which is very, very good.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` answered the questions, he was knowledgeable, he did an outstanding job and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know it, and nobody's going to be able to _ even our spin merchants or the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spin merchants _ ca n't change the facts.'' Immediately after the nationally broadcast, 90-minute debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee congratulated <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for `` a superb job.'' Speaking to a gathering of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law enforcement officials sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas-Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would seek $ 250 million annually for the next four years `` to incarcerate the hardened felons and rising number of drug offenders.'' He also said he would use assets seized from drug traffickers to help finance new prison construction. Expanding on a proposal that he unveiled Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that as president he would create a unit within the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division that would be devoted solely to mobilizing government resources in a battle against violence-prone street gangs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Debrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the proposal would cost about $ 50 million and would involve `` administrative efforts to coordinate and fully utilize existing resources at the federal, state and local levels.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believes in rehabilitation to some extent, especially for first-time offenders. `` But let's face it, some criminals are just plain bad. They're not going to be rehabilitated They're not going to reform,'' he said. `` You're not going to solve the crime problem as some would by talking tough while pursuing the same failed policies of liberal leniency,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He accused Democratic opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of having a `` liberal sense'' that counters the `` common sense'' that the death penalty is a deterrent. `` I say that our society simply can not afford any more liberal experimentation with crime,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called again for converting obsolete military bases into prisons and for 100 new special agents to expand the government's repeat-offender program for handling those who commit repeated crimes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that white-collar criminals should not be given special treatment. `` We should throw the book at them,'' he said. After the Quayle-Bentsen debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned reporters and camera crews to his hotel to say that his running mate `` came through with flying colors'' under tremendous pressure. `` Now people can see what I've seen all along,'' he said. `` This guy did a superb job,'' he added. `` I could n't be happier.'' From <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, the vice president headed to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Little Rock, Ark. Prior to the debate, the vice president invited reporters to watch the first question with him, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared his running mate's response a `` home run.'' `` He's doing good, good opening, strong opening, right out of the ball park, the <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON> of American politics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>'s baseball player <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON>. `` He hit it the first answer, home run.,'' Asked if the question to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ on criticisms of his qualifications was a fair one, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` Everything's fair in this business ... I'd like to get a slow ball like that in the first one. It's easy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said that while viewing the debate in his hotel suite the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee cheered on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with such comments as `` he's doing a fantastic job.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and told him it was `` a 10-strike,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also called President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to express his delight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then told reporters that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people saw <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` in form, in control, answering substantive questions in a substantive way and strong.'' Asked about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s performance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to criticize the other guy.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled a $ 3.9 billion `` Invest in Our Children'' package that encompassed educational, health, anti-gang and anti-toxic proposals that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said would combine to improve educational opportunity for children. The 32-page plan included some previously announced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals, including a tax credit for child care, and a provision aimed at the poor calling for Medicaid coverage for pregnant women and infants at up to 185 percent of the poverty level. Such individuals who do not have private sector insurance could `` ` buy in'' to the Medicaid system at an amount that does not exceed 4 or 5 percent of their income, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A woman suffering from tuberculosis who repeatedly refused treatment was arrested by authorities, who suspect she spread the disease to family members and acquaintances. The woman, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 29, was taken Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Montabello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for treatment. <PERSON> Elin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON>, director of epidemiology and disease control for the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was arrested by sheriff's deputies under a little-used provision of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> law that requires public health officials to control the spread of contagious diseases. Tuberculosis, which causes coughing, night sweats and profound weight loss, can be cured but can cause death if not treated, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. Health officials can not force <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> to receive treatment for the disease, but they can incarcerate her to prevent its spread, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was described as being in a highly infectious stage of the disease, and if she leaves the hospital, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said, she can be jailed. Health officials repeatedly tried to persuade <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> to be treated for the disease and then obtained a court order in a civil proceeding before seeking a criminal warrant for her arrest, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. Several members of her family have tested positive for tuberculosis, and are expected to receive treatment. `` I do n't want people to think we go around arresting people who have communicable diseases because we do n't,'' <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. `` This was an extreme case.'' Tuberculosis is caused by an airborne strain of bacteria that can be transmitted by sharing a close space with an infected person, she said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> exuberantly pointed today to polls suggesting he'd won his debate with Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> focused on running mate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declaring him `` still way ahead'' in the presidential race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the debate as he gave an anti-crime speech today in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Afterward, when asked about Wednesday night's encounter, he said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` did an outstanding job and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know it.''

He said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` Sure, as friend of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> I deeply resented his trying to put <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mantle over himself when he did n't have a record that compared with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' Democrats hoped the debate had dramatized their contention that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was too inexperienced to step into the presidency on a moment's notice. In a 90-minute meeting where neither candidate made any big mistakes, the most electric moment came when the boyish-looking, 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was defending his qualifications and said he had as much experience as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had had when he sought the presidency. It was a comparison he has made often. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> shot back, `` Senator, I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, I knew <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' With an icy stare, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> interrupted to say, `` That was really uncalled for, senator.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> replied, `` You are the one that was making the comparison, senator ... and I'm the one who knew him well.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seized on the question of competence, telling a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> rally, `` The most important qualification for the vice president is that he's ready at a moment's notice to assume the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Tonight <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> demonstrated that he was the only one on that stage who's ready.'' In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> hit a `` home run'' right from the start of the debate and was n't fazed by the questions about his fitness. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` under tremendous pressure ... came through with flying colors. Now people can see what I've seen all along.'' With just 33 days remaining before the election, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was teaming up with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today at a rally in <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was heading for stops in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tenneesse </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned separately in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. The third and final debate of the campaign will be held late next week in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> square off for the second, and last, time. In a presidential race that is virtually a tossup at this point, polls indicate that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is costing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> support, with many voters uneasy about his readiness for high office. It was the first question put to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Wednesday night, and he replied, `` I have more experience than others that have sought the office of vice president.'' He said that on national security and arms control, education and jobs and the deficit, `` I have more experience than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' The 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was never challenged on his qualifications, but he pointed out that he had served in combat, was a businessman and a farmer as well as a senator. `` What we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accused the Republicans of attempting to slash Social Security and said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted eight times to cut benefits. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> accused him of distorting the record and said the Democrats were trying `` to scare the older people of this country.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had appointed environmental officials who were the equivalent of <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had allowed a major environmental problem to fester in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> assailed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on his record on veterans' issues. He said his rival had sponsored legislation to tax the combat pay and disability pay for `` people who are lying in the hospital.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not reply to the charge. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, for setting up a breakfast club for lobbyists willing to pay $ 10,000 in campaign contributions. `` I'm sure they were n't paying to have cornflakes,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said there was nothing illegal in what he did, but said the breakfast club was a `` doozy'' of a mistake. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has collected `` over a quarter of a million dollars'' in honoraria, much of it from special interest groups, and that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could spend the money on golf club dues if he wants. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted immediately after the debate found <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the winner over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 51 percent to 27 percent. The 637 voters polled favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a margin of 50 percent to 45 percent before the debate, and by a margin of 50 percent to 48 afterward. The margin of error was 4.5 percent. All six debate judges who scored the contest for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> picked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as the winner by an overall margin of 148-125. A perfect score was 180.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today accused Democrat <PERSON> LLoyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of `` a cheap shot ... unbecoming a senator of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' for criticizing Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for comparing himself with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, posing for pictures with President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, was asked by a reporter whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be damaged by being compared with the late president. `` No, I think that remark was a cheap shot and unbecoming a senator of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the president said. Another reporter asked if <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had n't `` led with his chin'' in comparing himself with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> during his vice presidential debate with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. `` No, the only comparison he was making was that he is being attacked, I think unfairly, on the basis of his age and his experience in government, and he was pointing out that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who sought the highest office and won it, had actually less experience in government than he has, and they were the same age,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied. As White House aides ushered reporters out of the Oval Office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called them back and said he did not believe that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` trying in any way to downgrade Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, sparked one of the sharpest exchanges of the debate when he said he had as much government experience as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, then a senator from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ran for president in 1960. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, replied, `` I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> police officer testified today that a man accused of taking 110 people hostage at a private school was armed with a rifle every time he saw him through the front door of the building. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, the defendant who is representing himself at his trial on kidnapping charges, asked Capt. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> whether he saw <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> ever point the weapon at children inside <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. `` Not directly at them, but you had it ready,'' Fields said. The defendant then asked him whether he thought <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s life might have been in danger and whether that could have been the reason he had the weapon. Fields said that could have been the case. In his opening statement to the jury Wednesday, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 43, defended his takeover of the school on Feb. 2 by saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution gives him the right to bear arms. `` I did n't kidnap anybody,'' the unemployed <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> resident told jurors. `` I went there to exercise my constitutional rights. The government is doing things to destroy the future of our country.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> has said he took over the school to call attention to the homeless and hungry in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. His trial was moved to <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> because of publicity in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. He began his defense after District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> told the jury that `` children and teachers were in stark, cold terror for endless hours'' during the incident. The 110 counts involve 104 students, five teachers and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a man <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is accused of duping into helping seize the school. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> was initially charged in the takeover, but authorities later said he was an unwilling participant. All the students, teachers and <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, plus officers and the school's headmaster, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carden </PERSON>, are among the 137 people subpoenaed to testify at the trial, which Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> said probably will last from five to seven days. Also summoned was Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who is to testify Friday about a bogus pardon he videotaped that led <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> to surrender 12 hours after he entered the elementary school, armed with a high-caliber rifle, two loaded automatic pistols and 2,000 rounds of ammunition, plus two unloaded guns he handed to <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> as they entered the school. `` I have a constitutional right to bear arms,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` I went there to prove my right to bear arms. ... I did n't mean to hurt anyone.'' In a rambling discourse, he told the jury that politicians do n't tell the truth, that people are poisoning water and air, that `` we're selling our children's futures'' with the national debt During the siege, he said, he told officers who tried to dissuade him that `` this is not a criminal act. It is a political act.'' In fact, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said, because the school was surrounded by officers, `` I felt like a hostage. It could have ended in five hours. They put me through psychological warfare.'' Assistant prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told jurors that a first-grade class went from 8:30 a.m., when <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> entered the school, until 1:46 p.m. `` with no food, no restroom, no water, no nothing.'' During the siege, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> `` always had children around him so he would n't get shot. He was using them as shields as well as hostages. ... He is certainly guilty of all counts of kidnapping.'' If convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> could be sentenced to more than 10,000 years in prison.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has formally changed its plans for the first phase of a Star Wars anti-missile defensive system, slashing the cost estimate for a rudimentary system from $ 115 billion to $ 69 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced today. `` This is a startling change,'' top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials told a joint hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>. But the lowered cost is the result of changes in the program, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> program; and Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Herres </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had completed an annual review of the program on Tuesday and approved a series of restructuring moves, they told the panels. The changes are designed to keep the research moving forward while addressing concerns that it would cost too much to begin deploying a system on the ground and in space, the Pentagon said. The restructuring `` absolutely does not'' mean the administration is pulling back from its original goal of developing a high-tech defensive system that could shield the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from nuclear missiles, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added. The program, as now modified, will still `` continue to emphasize research on space defense; to provide for early deployment of space-based sensor systems; to maintain the option to develop a limited protection system, given a future national decision and the funding to do so, and to provide for a balance between near - and longer-term weapons technology programs,'' the statement said The lowered projections surprised some legislators. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, said he viewed the numbers with `` some skepticism. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said costs on other weapons have dropped while the weapons were on the drawing boards, but then rose once the programs entered the construction phase. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> denied that the program's goals have changed and a defense of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population centers is still the aim. `` The goals have not changed,'' he told Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., in answer to a question The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative, is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons that could be deployed in space and on the ground to automatically shoot down <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly refused in recent years to fund the program at the pace sought by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but nonetheless has allowed the research to continue. Last June, when it became clear <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was going to slash more than $ 700 million from the president's fiscal 1989 request of $ 4.9 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered the entire program restructured. It was those modifications, in turn, which were reviewed Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s highest level weapons review panel. According to Tuesday's announcement, the huge reduction in the estimated cost of a first-phase system was achieved primarily by scaling back plans for space-based interceptor rockets _ known as SBI's. The Pentagon now believes it can develop a more capable `` seeker'' guidance unit for the rocket, improving its chances of hitting a target and thus reducing the number that would have to be fired in a war. `` This, together with shifting more of the burden to the lower-cost ... -LRB- ground-based rocket interceptors -RRB- _ which was increased in inventory by about 70 percent _ enabled us to cut the size of the SBI constellation in half,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The department declined to say specifically how many SBI interceptors it planned to put in space for the modified phase one system, saying the number was classified. `` But there would be fewer than 200 carrier vehicles, with several <ORGANIZATION> SBI </ORGANIZATION>'s aboard each carrier,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The department said it also had achieved the cost savings by reducing the sophistication of a planned surveillance and tracking satellite system. The various modifications will not have any effect on estimates that it will take several years yet for researchers to determine even that a phase one system is workable, the Pentagon said. `` The decision to deploy a strategic defense system will be made by future national leaders in the early to mid 1990's, contingent upon adequate funding levels,'' the Pentagon said.

<TEXT>
 If you thought the Quayle-Bentsen debate was heated, you should have seen the MacLaine-Letterman one the night before. One day before the vice presidential candidates sparred on network television Wednesday, actress <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> appeared on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' ostensibly to plug her new film, `` Madame Sousatzka.'' But the host, to her annoyance, preferred to discuss <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>'s tales of exotic past lives, which she has written about in two books `` I already said I do n't think we can get into it and you keep harping on it. Maybe <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> was right, maybe you are an -LRB- expletive -RRB-,'' <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> said. Network censors bleeped the remark. `` Why did you call me that?'' asked <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>. `` I thought it was a funny remark,'' answered <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>. `` Calling me an -LRB- expletive -RRB-?'' wondered <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>. The comedian asked later: `` Are you really upset or are you pretending?'' `` You ca n't tell?'' responded <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>. `` I've never met you,'' said <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>. `` You've met me. You were running around these dressing rooms at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> trying to get me to go on your show,'' <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> said. And: `` Is there anything you want to talk about?'' asked he. `` You're the interviewer, you tell me, you've wanted me here for three years,'' answered she. `` And I think we'll probably wait another three,'' said the host. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said he did n't think anyone went away mad. `` It was good TV, and we would consider her as a possible guest on the show in the future,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. And in the blue corner? `` Maybe we were irascible lovers in a past life,'' suggested <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> through a spokesman.

 More than 100 people were reported killed Thursday in flooding that has ravaged thousands of Pakistani villages, and another 59 people were feared drowned after four rescue boats sank. Police said 19 people were believed killed Wednesday when three army boats shuttling people from their flooded homes sank. On Tuesday, another rescue boat sank and 40 people were believed to have drowned, officials said. In addition, another 104 people are known to have drowned in the flooding, which began two weeks ago. Police said more than 100 people are missing. According to government figures, the flooding has affected more than 3 million people and 4,000 villages, mainly in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The flooding began after heavy rains sent the Sutlej, <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chenab </LOCATION> rivers over their banks. Medical officials near the ancient <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> have warned of an epidemic of skin diseases in the affected areas because of the lack of sanitation.

 A 25-year-old woman was charged with infanticide after admitting she placed each of her four children in plastic bags when they were babies and threw them in the garbage. <PERSON> Sylvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulon </PERSON>, charged Wednesday by Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmentier </PERSON>, said she committed the crimes because she was `` alone and broke.'' She said she gave birth in 1984, 1985, 1986 and early in 1988. She explained her weight changes to colleagues and neighbors by simply saying that she was eating too much. Authorities described Ms. <PERSON> Coulon </PERSON> as a child-care worker. An anonymous phone call in June tipped police, who began questioning neighbors. On Monday, Miss <PERSON> Coulon </PERSON> was called in for questioning, police said. She said she gave birth four times and disposed of each infant, police said. According to police, she said she was once again pregnant but this time wanted to keep the child.

<HEAD>7-Year-Old Siamese Twins Doing Well After Separation</HEAD>

 Vietnamese Siamese twins were reported doing well Thursday after being separated in a 14-hour operation. A 72-member medical team operated on the 7-year-old twins, <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> Tu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were `` in very good condition,'' said <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which provided most of the medical equipment for the operation. The twins' vital readings were stable, <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted a Vietnamese doctor in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as saying that the twins were given tranquilizers and pain killers and were asleep most of time. But he said it would take about a week to judge the success of the operation, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. The twins were joined at the pelvis and shared genitals and a single pair of legs, one bowel, an anus, a bladder, and a pair of kidneys. Each twin received one leg, while the organs went to <PERSON> Duc </PERSON>, the more healthy of the two, Japanese news media reported. Viet has been comatose since May 1986. Vietnamese officials have said the number of Siamese twins in their country rose after American use of defoliants known to produce birth defects during the Vietnam War, including in the central highlands where Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were born in February 1981.

<HEAD>Radicals Stage Violent Protest In Government Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot police arrested a group of radical students who stormed a government office with iron pipes and firebombs and shouted anti-American and anti-government slogans. At least two students were reported seriously injured when police broke into the office to stop the two-hour protest. Police said 23 students from eight universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> overpowered security guards and charged into Parliamentary Hall, a legislative office building near the National Assembly building. All were arrested. The students demanded immediate punishment of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who has been under investigation for alleged corruption and brutality. The students broke windows and unfolded a giant placard that read `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` <PERSON> Arrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and his wife.'' The radicals locked themselves inside the fourth-floor office of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho-yong </PERSON>, a senior member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and tossed out papers, chairs and a portrait of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was not in the office. Dissidents charge that <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, a former army general, played a role in supressing a 1980 uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which nearly 200 people were killed. Hundreds of riot police backed by firetrucks surrounded the building and spread mattresses on the ground to prevent suicide attempts by students who threatened to burn the office or jump from windows if police intervened. One student cut his stomach with a razor when about 100 police officers broke through the office door to end the seizure, according to witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another protester jumped from the window and was taken to the hospital, where he was reported in stable condition. One of <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s aides and several policemen were also hurt, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said Leaflets scattered by the students criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which the dissidents say supports the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The students are demanding the withdrawal of about 42,000 American troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. Also Thursday, about 500 students at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dongkuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> battled riot police with firebombs and rocks after an anti-government rally.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Thursday continued its verbal attacks on the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, calling them `` dictatorial'' and an excuse for suppression of popular protest. The government in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> also accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of using the Olympics to keep the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> divided. The Games, which began Sept. 17, ended Sunday. `` Facts vividly show how strongly the divisive Olympics, the dictatorial Olympics, induced by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists and their stooges into <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, was rejected by the people,'' the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded to be a co-host at the Games. The International Olympic Committee said the Games are given to a single city and can not be shared. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been charging for months that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were scheming to use the Olympics to permanently divide the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, split into capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and communist North since 1945. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists' ` two Koreas' plot has become more pronounced nowadays,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Minju </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION>, a state-run newspaper, said last week. `` It is proved by the fact that they ... are employing despicable means to take this opportunity to create an atmosphere for creating ` two Koreas.''' South Korean officials had said they believed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would stage terrorist attacks on the South to disrupt the Games and set up tight security, but no incidents occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> conducted exercises near the peninsula to prevent terrorist attacks. The North Korean news agency branded the tight security as `` suppression.'' `` The fascist clique are intensifying suppression, calling people's protests against the dictatorial Olympics a ` dangerous act,' `` the agency said. `` Subsequently, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is now in a more horrible atmosphere.'' The newspaper <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinmun </PERSON>, the official organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION>, said the same day that `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists, on the plea of ` Olympic safety,' sent carrier flotillas and many other aggression forces to and around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to resort to a nuclear blackmail.'' Radical students in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, opposed to what they see as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for an unpopular government, had threatened to disrupt the Games' last event, the men's marathon, and there was visible security in place. `` The marathon, which is usually held amid enthusiastic cheers of crowds, was held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in a horrifying atmosphere, the police lining the route instead of cheering crowds,'' the news agency said. `` It was not a race but a torturous experience for the marathoners who had to run through the narrow corridor of police walls.''

 A spokesman for a drug company said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s personal physician purchased the same anabolic steroid that was found in the sprinter's urine after he won the 100-meter dash at the Olympics The physician, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaphan </PERSON>, has told some media organizations that he has never given stanozolol to any of his patients. He said that includes <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was stripped of his gold medal after he tested positive for the drug at the Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, last month. But in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON> Astaphan </PERSON> said he has prescribed some anabolic steroids to some patients.

 Chileans rejected President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bid to extend his 15-year rule in a referendum that cleared the way for democratic elections. The military government conceded defeat today. The entire 16-member Cabinet submitted their resignations early today, Labor Minister <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Plata </PERSON> told reporters. He also said the assistant ministry officials resigned. He gave no further details. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, gave no statement on the results of Wednesday's balloting, and it was not known whether he would accept the resignations or shuffle his Cabinet. Thousands of celebrating students marched through <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> today, and people in downtown buildings showered streets with confetti. With 99.6 percent of the vote counted, 54.7 percent rejected <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and 43 percent voted for him in the `` yes'' or `` no'' referendum, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said at midday. More than 7.2 million of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 7.4 million registered voters cast the first presidential ballots in 18 years, the ministry said. Some waited in lines up to a mile long. `` The country delivered its mandate ... -LRB- and is -RRB- on the way to a transition to an authentic democracy,'' <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, leader of a 16-party opposition coalition, told cheering supporters today. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, remains in power until 1990. If he had won the referendum, he would have served until 1997. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> pledged to respect the results of Wednesday's balloting but also to enforce the 1980 constitution, which the political opposition wants changed. Police reported few incidents of violence, and traffic was normal later in the morning. Leaders of a 16-party opposition coalition promised to pursue national unity as they seek a speedy return to democratic government. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>; <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> hailed the peaceful reaction a sign of Chileans' maturity and civic responsibility. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the party took measures to keep people quiet `` and prevent disorders that could have been used by the government as a pretext for repression.'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> formally conceded defeat early today after an emergency meeting with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the four-man military junta that serves as a legislature, and the 15-member Cabinet. `` We abide by the results already known to the people,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said, reading from a text. His expression grave, he added that the government `` reiterates its unbreakable resolve to comply with, and have others comply with, the constitution and laws.'' The opposition has said it will pursue negotiations with the armed forces on changing the constitution, pushed through by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in 1980. The document lays out a schedule for a return to democracy, including a special provision for Wednesday's referendum. In case of a `` no'' majority, it called for competitive presidential elections to be held in December 1989, with the winner assuming power in March 1990. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remains leader until then. The constitution also calls for elections in 1990 for a congress, disbanded when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a September 1973 coup that ousted President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist who won the last presidential election in 1970. Opposition leaders want the presidential ballot moved up. They also want to eliminate provisions in the constitution that make congress virtually powerless to amend it and that give the armed forces both autonomy and supervisory role in national policy-making. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said in a victory speech: `` We reiterate our proposal to reach agreement with the armed forces on the terms of an institutional political change that would result in free elections quickly, and in a congress totally and freely elected.'' The military made no immediate comment on the proposal but has rejected such calls before. There were no significant reports of fraud during the voting, but after polls closed scattered violence was reported by authorities, including the burning of a public bus by anti-government protesters. In the often combative southern slum of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, hundreds sat outside, following the returns by radio, waving flags and setting off firecrackers. Soldiers did not intervene.

<TEXT>
 The grand jury in the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case concluded in a report issued today that the black teen-ager apparently concocted her story of abduction and rape by a gang of white men. The 170-page report said there was `` no evidence that any sexual assault occurred,'' and it suggested that the girl herself was responsible for the feces-smeared condition in which she was found after a four-day disappearance. The seven-month investigation went on without the cooperation of the 16-year-old Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> or her family, who with their advisers accused authorities of engaging in a racially motivated cover-up. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said he has filed ethics complaints against Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, for making `` every effort to prevent the criminal justice system from uncovering the truth of what happened.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> accused the advisers of `` opportunism and hucksterism in presenting their personal agenda'' and added: `` Perhaps the greatest disservice done by the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers is the reckless manner in which they jeopardized the rights of future victims of racial assaults.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers bitterly attacked the report. `` What should we expect from 21 whites from <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION>, referring to 21 whites on the panel of 23. `` It is clear they never intended to arrest and prosecute those people who did this to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' Another adviser, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is `` not after people who rape black girls. ... They want to stop anybody who will stand up for the rights of black people in this country.'' The grand jury heard testimony from more than 180 witnesses and received more than 250 exhibits of evidence on the racially charged case. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found Nov. 28, seemingly dazed, outside an apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Her body was smeared with feces and scrawled with racial slurs in charcoal. She claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by the white men, and she implicated law enforcement officials in the attack. `` There is nothing in regard to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s appearance on Nov. 28 that is inconsistent with this condition having been self-inflicted,'' the grand jury said. It said she had spent some of the four-day period at her old apartment. `` Although we have not found any evidence to substantiate her allegations, we remain concerned about the welfare of this young woman,'' the panel said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> would not speculate on why Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> may have concocted the story. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which disclosed the grand jury's findings last month, reported at the time that the panel had evidence suggesting that she made up the story to avoid punishment from her mother's boyfriend for late nights out The newspaper said the grand jury also heard allegations that Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> may have been involved with drugs or questionable characters. It said the grand jury found the teen-ager misled doctors, social workers, reporters and public officials with false and fragmentary accounts of the alleged abduction. No charges were brought against Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. The grand jury said it found `` no legally sufficient evidence to charge any person with a crime or to establish that a crime occurred.'' A grand jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is not permitted to criticize ordinary citizens it does not indict. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the false allegations by <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> led to `` an enormous expenditure of money and time.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s lawyers `` seriously impeded the investigation by making false public statements, including accusing innocent persons of assault, rape and murder. They told their clients to engage in illegal conduct,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who went on to detail 19 instances of alleged false statements. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has agreed to have the state shoulder the cost of the investigation, which has probably topped $ 500,000, because he feels `` the people of <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have already been hurt enough, said spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>. The panel also found there was no evidence of a cover-up by law enforcement officials. It specifically cleared <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a police officer who committed suicide shortly after Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers had accused both of involvement The grand jury issued recommendations to the Legislature for legal reforms, including a proposal that would allow the relative of a dead person to bring a defamation case when the individual is falsely accused of a felony. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> released the findings at the request of <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who was named special prosecutor in the case by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> praised the thoroughness of the grand jury and said the panel reached its conclusions properly. `` Really, it was beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, was sentenced to 30 days in jail in June for defying a subpoena to testify, but she defied arrest by living in a church. The grand jury subpoenaed Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, but later rescinded its vote when it was clear she would not cooperate, according to published reports. The family recently moved to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, but has since left. Their whereabouts were not immediately known.

<TEXT>
 Four nuns critical of recent modernizations such as television and videotaped movies in their monastery have barricaded themselves in a wing because they fear they will be ejected. The Roman Catholic nuns sealed themselves Tuesday morning in the infirmary of the Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of Mt. <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> and remained there today. The nuns, members of the Order of the Discalced Carmelites, said monastery officials told them four months ago they would have to move because of sharp differences in the way the cloister should be run. The order is a cloistered group devoted to daily prayer and contemplation in solitude. However, <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON> said today the women would not be ejected. `` The sisters are not being evicted. The diocese will continue to help these four sisters do what they agreed to do, to find a monastery where they can live prayerfully and contemplatively,'' he said. The nuns, ages 28 to 45, moved food and their belongings into the infirmary, tied the door shut, and have vowed to stay there until they receive word from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON> said the diocese has received <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> approval for its actions. Calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for comment were not immediately returned. `` We entered the monastery for a particular life style, and what these other, liberal nuns did is change these rules,'' Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON>, one of the nuns, told The Record of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>. None of the nuns could be reached for comment today; a reporter left a note at the convent gate to be carried up to them. The nuns told the newspaper that <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the monastery's prioress, began to modernize life at the monastery after her arrival last year They said she introduced television, videotaped movies, music and socializing. This created a backlash among the more orthodox members of the order, they said. `` It's unnecessary noise, constant interruptions, too much hustle and bustle,'' Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` This is an all-around change, a change in the spirit of the monastery.'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> refused to comment today.

 About 100 people protested outside a clinic today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s third day of anti-abortion demonstrations, and police dragged away at least seven people for climbing barricades outside the building. The protesters were arrested near the Feminist Women's Health Center. Police asked them to walk to the vans, and when they refused, they were dragged about 200 feet to the vehicles and taken to jail. The rest of the protesters stood outside the barricades, singing hymns. Meanwhile, protest leaders are claiming continued success in their promised `` Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' despite dwindling numbers at nightly rallies and fewer demonstrations at daytime protests. On Tuesday, helmeted police officers stood guard at the Feminist Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as patients inside huddled and employees went about their business and protesters outside shouted Bible verses. The clinic is one of seven targeted by Operation Rescue, the New York-based group staging demonstrations here this week. The number of demonstrators has dwindled since Tuesday, when 343 were arrested on misdemeanor charges. Fourteen were arrested Wednesday, said City Solicitor <PERSON> Raines </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Three of them were charged with simple assault when a patient they tried to bar from <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> stumbled and fell. Protest leaders who dubbed this week's protests the `` Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' said they have prevented abortions with their demonstrations, which include attempting to blockade entrances. Clinic officials disputed that, and said aside from some rescheduling of appointments, business has not been affected. But a 21-year-old patient from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said she was horrified by the severity of the protests as she arrived at the clinic Wednesday. `` You've got people throwing themselves on the ground trying to trip you up and make you fall, peeking under the umbrella and all that,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` I was in a lot of pain. I could have been hemorrhaging or bleeding to death, and here they are,'' she said. `` Nobody should have to go through that kind of terrorism.'' On Wednesday, the center, which serves 10 to 50 patients a day in a building near downtown, braced for a morning protest. Two police officers were stationed at the clinic's entrances. Other police officers, several on horseback, deployed at metal curbside barricades. Employees and pro-choice volunteers gripped black umbrellas labeled `` Choice'' as they waited to escort patients into the facility. The demonstrators arrived in midafternoon with drastically reduced ranks. Most demonstrators said they limited their activities to praying and singing hymns. As a patient approached the building surrounded by escorts, one male demonstrator shouted `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said, ` Suffer little children that come unto me!' Do n't you hear your baby begging for his life?''' Patients inside shied away from the clinic's windows and whispered among themselves. Employees occasionally stepped away from their duties to check on the demonstrators and talk with the policemen. Center director <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> spent most of the day outside meeting with police officials and volunteers. `` It's just really been frantic, with all of this going on,'' she said. `` It's had a big impact on the staff and the patients.'' Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who was wearing a large button that read `` I Survived Operation Rescue,'' said the demonstrators were `` acting like thugs.'' `` We just want to make sure everything is going well,'' she said. Protesters began the demonstrations here July 19, during the Democratic National Convention. Protest leaders frequently have likened their efforts to civil rights demonstrations and say they are following the non-violent teachings of such leaders as the late <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Protesters on Tuesday complained that police treated them with unnecessary harshness, twisting arms and fingers and using pressure-point holds just under the ears to force them into buses. `` I think what is happening in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> right now is just terribly anti-American,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a colleague of King's. `` It hurts me so bad that we who were the leaders of the movement in the'50s,'60s and'70s, are now the political leaders, and we are doing the same things to demonstrators that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> and those did to us.'' However, another King colleague, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, said that while there are similarities to methods he employed 20 years ago, the aims are different. `` Very rarely did we deliberately try to close down a business,'' the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` We did n't want to interfere with the free flow of commerce.''

<HEAD>New Yorkers Face Record $3 Billion Bond Issue for Roads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With memories still fresh of a bridge collapsing into a rushing creek and killing 10 people, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is asking voters to approve the biggest bond issue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> history to repair roads. The $ 3 billion bond issue on the ballot Nov. 8 comes five years after voters agreed to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s proposal to borrow $ 1.25 billion to `` rebuild <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' With the money from the earlier bond issue due to run out in March, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has 1,600 miles of highway deemed to be in poor condition by its inspectors, 660 miles of roads too small to handle the traffic and 7,400 bridges rated unacceptable. `` Everybody concedes the need,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` I hear no one arguing -LRB- against -RRB- the absolute necessity of investing billions and billions of dollars in our roads and bridges.'' A coalition of construction and labor officials supporting the bond issue is reminding voters of the April 1987 collapse of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thruway </LOCATION> bridge over the rushing <LOCATION> Schoharie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. `` Where will you be the next time the worst case happens?'' asks one TV commercial. Conservative rural upstate politicians, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> are among the opponents of the bond issue. They agree roads are in disrepair but are pressing for a pay-as-you-go system with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dedicating all highway, gasoline and automobile-related taxes and fees to road construction and repair. `` Borrowing begets borrowing,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, vice president of the 1.8 million-member state <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The'83 bond issue begat the'88 bond issue. Then where do we go? The next logical step is for a $ 7.5 billion bond issue in 1992 and then maybe a $ 15 billion bond issue in 1995. That's the way we're going.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has told New Yorkers that if enough of them do n't vote `` yes'' in November, they may face an increase of as much as 20 cents on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 8-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to pay for needed highway work. <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> officials contend taxes will have to be raised anyway. `` The enormous costs of the debt service from the bonds are going to have be borne by somebody,'' said <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Slashes Cost Estimate for First Phase of SDI Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what one official acknowledged was `` a startling change,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has slashed the cost of the first phase of a Star Wars defensive shield from $ 115 billion to $ 69 billion, and the system could be available within a decade. But Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the figures should be viewed with `` some skepticism'' because the cost of weapons programs often goes down while they are in the planning stages and then rises when production starts The new figures arise from a restructuring of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, the formal name of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 5-year-old program to develop a high-tech shield against attack by Soviet nuclear missiles Those changes were approved after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered a review when it became apparent the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would cut <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars budget request for the fiscal year that began last Saturday. The president sought $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 4.1 billion, up from last year's $ 3.9 billion budget. The current debate over Star Wars centers around plans to develop a first-stage program that could form the basis of a wide-ranging system. The initial phase is based chiefly on space-based interceptor rockets, known as SBIs, that would be housed in flying `` garages'' circling the globe, ready to be fired at launched Soviet missiles. The large cost reduction is chiefly achieved by scaling back plans for the number of interceptor rockets, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials told a joint hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees. `` This is a startling change,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, undersecretary of defense for acquisition. Wwhile the exact figure is classified, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said `` there would be fewer than 200 carrier vehicles -LRB- garages -RRB- with several SBIs aboard each carrier.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said it can develop a better guidance unit for the rockets, meaning the chances of success for each rocket would be increased and thus the number that would have to be fired would be reduced. In addition, the sophistication of a planned surveillance and tracking satellite system is being reduced, leading to another savings. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, director of the SDI program, said the decision whether to build a first-stage system could be made early in the next decade, with deployment to begin in the late 1990s. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> also disputed critics who say that the program's original goal of protecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population centers has changed to protection of nuclear weapons sites `` The goals have not changed,'' <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said, and the program is still aimed at building protection for people. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Herres </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, was more cautious about the program, saying `` one should not expect a militarily useful system'' until after the first phase is constructed. The lowered cost does n't mean a reduction in the system, <PERSON> Herres </PERSON> said. `` There's no reason to believe there's going to be a reduction in capability.'' Both <PERSON> Herres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said development of a first-phase SDI would mean that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, the 1972 pact that limits the defenses each superpower can build. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration have been arguing over how to interpret the treaty, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seeking a `` broad'' view that would permit expanded SDI testing and congressional Democrats backing a `` narrow'' view that they say would n't damage the pact. In answer to questions, <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> said the administration, shortly before it leaves office next January, plans to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about future SDI testing plans and how those projects would affect the ABM treaty. `` At some point, we have to have a broad interpretation or break out'' of the treaty, <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> said. He said the decision is `` way down the road,'' but Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said, `` ` way down the road' is too vague. At that point, <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> said future testing plans are now under development. The changes announced Thursday were approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acqusition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s highest weapons review panel. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> complained about congressional budget cuts, saying they had hurt the program. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has annually reduced the proposed SDI budget, although granting increases from previous years. Because of uncertainty last summer about spending for the first-phase SDI project, Star Wars contractors laid off 1,600 employees, <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Exempt Some Savings Bonds from Income Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today voted 94-0 to exempt from federal income tax <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds that are bought to finance a college or vocational education. `` This is a simple, sensible way to help families save for college expenses,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., sponsor of the proposal `` It sends a loud, clear message about our priorities.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s provision was attached to a bill that corrects errors in the 1986 tax overhaul, grants special tax relief to various groups of taxpayers, and includes tax increases to pay for the benefits. The bill is one of the few major pieces of legislation standing in the way of adjournment of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s college-expenses amendment is similar to one that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed in the budget that he submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last January. Under the provision, a family could avoid tax on any savings bonds that are redeemed to pay for post-secondary education of any family member. The full tax exemption would be available to families with adjusted gross incomes of up to $ 60,000 a year. Those with incomes between $ 60,000 and $ 80,000 would get a reduced benefit; no exemption would be allowed those with incomes over $ 80,000 a year. The change would cost the government an estimated $ 285 million a year by 1984. Under <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s amendment, that cost would be paid by eliminating the tax exemption now allowed parents for any dependent child over the age of 24 who is a full-time student. Buyers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds pay no tax on the interest they earn until the bonds are redeemed. They already are exempt from state and local income taxes.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said investigations into the alleged slayings of 10 peasants by soldiers were inconclusive, and he ordered that the matter be studied further. As <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> spoke with journalists Wednesday, forensic specialists exhumed the bodies of seven of 10 people killed Sept. 21 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Forensic physician <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> told reporters after the first three bodies were pulled from the mass grave that powder burns indicated they were shot from six inches away. The bodies of three other people killed Sept. 21 were buried in nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> and were to be exhumed later. Relatives and neighbors of the seven men and three women slain said they were killed by soldiers of the Jiboa Battalion after most of the town's residents were detained on suspicion of collaborating with leftist guerrillas. The army said eight villagers were detained but that they were killed when guerrillas ambushed the army unit taking them to a base for interrogation. No soldier was killed in the alleged ambush, the army said. It said two attacking guerrillas were killed. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said he had received four reports on the killings _ from a human rights commission, the attorney general's office, the armed forces and the office of the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` I am still studying the case, but until now none of the documents provides sufficient criteria. I have asked the attorney general's office and the armed forces to deepen their investigations,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. Leftist rebels have fought a 9-year-old civil war against the U.S.-backed government. The army has not been accused of civilian killings on the scale of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> killings in four years. Also Wednesday, about 300 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students marched through downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with a coffin containing the body of a university security guard slain Monday. The state university, in a statement, said guard <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Escamilla </PERSON>, 34, was shot by two men in a university cafeteria. `` This criminal act is part of the government and military campaign against the university's just struggles,'' the communique said. The military considers the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> a stronghold of guerrilla supporters. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> had been detained for three days last year by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> on suspicion of guerrilla collaboration. He was released for lack of evidence.

<TEXT>
 Teen-age mothers enrolled in a comprehensive program to train them for jobs and help them become better parents went on to earn higher salaries than women who did not receive the help, it was reported Thursday. Children of women aided by Project Redirection also did better than the children of the comparison group, said researchers who followed up on those who participated in the program five years ago. `` The program led to more people working _ and people earning more when they were working,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gueron </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demonstration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which managed the project. Project Redirection, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, operated from 1980 to 1982 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and later extended to seven other places, the foundation said. More than 800 teen-age mothers participated for about a year each. Five years after the program, 34 percent of the women who had participated in Project Redirection were employed, earning an average of $ 200 a week, said Ms. <PERSON> Gueron </PERSON>. Among a comparison group that was not enrolled in the program, 28 perwent of the women were employed five years later, and they earned an average of $ 161 a week. Researchers said the project's most dramatic impact was on teen-agers who were receiving welfare when they enrolled in the program. Five years later, 34 percent had gotten jobs. They earned an average of $ 224 a week. Among the comparison group initially on welfare, 24 percent were employed five years later. They earned an average of $ 154 a week. `` We've known for some time that teen mothers are at great risk of long-term welfare dependency,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gueron </PERSON>. `` It is particularly helpful to have positive results now that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the states have shown interest in making teen mothers a priority for services.'' The program targeted low-income women, 17 years old or younger, who had a child or were pregnant and who had not completed high school. They received health care, education and help preparing for jobs, and also learned nutrition, family planning, parenting skills and household budgeting. Women from the community served as mentors for the teens. The researchers found that the program enhanced the teen-agers' parenting skills Their children scored better in vocabulary and behavior than did the children of women not enrolled in the program. To build on the findings of Project Redirection, Ms. <PERSON> Gueron </PERSON>'s company, a nonprofit research organization that designs and evaluates programs for the disadvantaged, is developing another program called New Chance That project is expected to provide education and employment services for up to 2,000 mothers, all high school dropouts on welfare, in 20 communities.

 Moslem fundamentalists announced a truce Thursday in their power struggle with pro-PLO leaders. Assailants killed two Palestinians suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The truce ended a rift that threatened to undermine the nearly 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` We must be united despite the differences in our beliefs,'' the Moslem fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> said in leaflets distributed Thursday. `` We are against any kind of split.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his group and the PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the Uprising agreed to coordinate general strikes, stop street fighting between the two groups and end the `` graffiti war'' of defamatory slogans aimed at each other. `` When we fight each other we are only helping the enemy -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said the bearded 25-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leader in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> advocates destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and is politically at odds with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, which is considering recognition of the Jewish state. A <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, confirmed that meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> took place but would not elaborate. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Since the start of the uprising, <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly challenged the Unified Leadership, which is made up of various <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions. Last month, a successful general strike called by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> in defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sparked fistfights between rival activists. Also Thursday, assailants killed <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON>, 46, a mukhtar, or traditional leader, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Biddya </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hospital Care for AIDS Children Tops $90,000, Much Unnecessary:
Studies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Children infected with the virus that causes AIDS are running up hospital bills of more than $ 90,000 each, often because they simply have nowhere else to go, studies indicate. `` Many of these children are in the hospital not because they're sick with AIDS or with anything else,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>, who examined cases of children testing positive for evidence of AIDS infection at <LOCATION> Yale-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> `` But because they test positive, nobody wants to take care of them at home or in foster care, and so there's no place else for them to go,'' she said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` Basically, they're in the hospital like a day-care center.'' Home lives of such babies tend to be chaotic because the mothers who transmitted the virus to them usually are intravenous drug abusers, often sick themselves and possibly in jail, researchers said. A significant number of babies who test positive are n't even infected _ they simply are carrying AIDS antibodies they inherited from their mothers, said Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>, now with <ORGANIZATION> Harborview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. AIDS antibodies _ natural disease-fighting agents produced by a person's system in the face of AIDS infection _ fade from uninfected babies' bloodstreams by age 6 months to 15 months, she said All AIDS tests in current use detect antibodies to the virus, rather than the virus itself. Even youngsters who really are sick often are put in the hospital or kept there unnecessarily, Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> said. `` Some of them easily could be getting treatment on an outpatient basis.'' Yet potential foster families often fear they might catch AIDS _ a remote possibility _ and insurance and Medicaid policies are set up to reimburse for hospital care more efficiently than for outpatient or home care, she said. By Sept. 26, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> had recorded 1,185 cases of AIDS among children under age 13, of whom 672 had died. Medical researchers have estimated that 10,000 children could be infected by 1991. The study by Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> and colleague <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, looked at children who had tested positive for AIDS antibodies at <LOCATION> Yale-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> through Oct. 31, 1987. `` Among children eligible for the study, 54 percent of their hospital days were judged medically unnecessary,'' the study said. The most common non-medical reason for hospitalization was lack of any other place to send the child, it said. A related study in Friday's Journal found that hospital stays for children infected with the AIDS virus ranged from $ 466 per day for `` boarder babies'' _ those who simply had nowhere else to go _ to $ 705 per day for the sickest youngsters. That study, led by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegarty </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, looked at 37 children diagnosed with AIDS or an AIDS-related condition in that hospital from 1981 through 1986. `` Average lifetime costs were $ 90,347 per child,'' the study said. `` One third of the total inpatient days and over 20 percent of the cost resulted from social rather than medical factors.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> called for better education and better reimbursement for potential foster parents and modified policies under the Medicaid program and private insurance plans. She noted that <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> waged a foster-parent education campaign and boosted reimbursement to $ 1,000 a month for foster families, helping reduce the rate of unnecessary hospital days from 64 percent in 1983 and 1984 to 30 percent in 1987 for the children studied.

<HEAD>Judge Raps Prosecutors for Seeking Indictment in Wrong

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge sharply criticized Iran-Contra prosecutors on Thursday for charging a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in the nation's capital with committing crimes across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> questioned a proposal by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to dismiss all the charges against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> so prosecutors could seek a new indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think it's a simple matter of I'll dismiss it and let you go to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and re-indict it,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON>, an associate independent counsel. The judge did not indicate how he would rule on <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request, which was made in a response to a defense motion to dismiss four of the indictment's five counts on the ground those alleged offenses occurred at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> instead of in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who used the pseudonym <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> when he was the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, is accused of conspiring with former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to illegally ship arms to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he found no basis for dismissing that count, since the alleged conspiracy took place both in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and elsewhere. But the judge sharply questioned the prosecution decision to indict <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 51, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on four counts of making false statements in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> superiors and to a presidential commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also lectured the prosecutors about fairness saying: `` There has to be a sense of justice in the process as well as the outcome, otherwise public confidence in the system is destroyed.'' <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON>, an associate independent counsel, said prosecutors had not misled the grand jury about the venue _ or location _ of the four alleged crimes, and had advised the panel that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> could waive his right to be tried in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The grand jury included the four <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> charges because they were related to the conspiracy, <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> said. `` That does n't give it any right to indict when the venue of the case is not here,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` It's the government's responsibility to advise the grand jury what it can or can not do under the law. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> should be barred from bringing the charges anew in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, saying prosecutors `` were trifling with the process.'' `` They intentionally pursued an indictment where they knew there was not even a colorable basis of venue on four of five counts,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` The prosecutors in this case are not beleaguered, overworked assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` assembled the prosecutorial equivalent of a Roman legion: 29 lawyers, 33 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, 11 <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents, four Customs agents.'' `` They are trifling with the process _ they ought to be stuck with the consequences,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he `` did n't know any basis for dismissing'' the conspiracy charge against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` The nub of the case is the conspiracy indictment, any way you look at it, everything else is superfluous really,'' the judge told <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON>. But he said allowing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to try <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the conspiracy count and obtain another indictment in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> `` places an intolerable burden on a single defendant.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staffer, in hot water over some politically oriented letters he sent out, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday that he was just doing what he thought was expected. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clews </PERSON>, who was fired from the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> and then reinstated pending a formal investigation of his activities, admitted sending letters to the news media critical of statements made by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I had simply tried to do my job as I understood it,'' <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> said. He told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the letters he sent out had been seen by his superiors at the agency's press office before they were dispatched <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, denied that, saying that the problem was in a postscript <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> added to one letter without her knowledge, and that other letters he sent out were not authorized at all. The letters were sent to broadcasters and newspapers in an effort to counter a statement by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust efforts had been a joke. In the letters, <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> challenged that statement and offered the services of commission members for interviews to discuss the agency's activities and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remarks. That drew a challenge from two commissioners, Democrat <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON> and independent <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON>, who questioned whether the letters violated the Hatch Act, which bans political activities by federal workers. <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> then left the commission after being given a choice of resigning or being fired, he testified. But he later complained that his resignation had come under duress, so he was returned to the payroll pending an investigation. He is currently on administrative leave. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> testified that one letter, sent to 800 talk show hosts across the nation, had been approved by agency officials, but that <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> subsequently added a postscript on his own and got a commission intern to sign Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' name. <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> told the subcommittee on oversignt and investigation that the intern signed the letter because Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had approved it but was out of town at the time it had to be printed. As for the postscript, he said he assumed Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was aware of it because she was present when the letter was placed in envelopes for mailing. A second letter questioning <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statements was sent to several columnists, carrying <PERSON> Clews </PERSON>' signature. He contended that Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had seen that letter in advance, but she denied that and testified that <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> had sent that out on his own, avoiding normal clearance procedures. A third letter offering to respond to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news bureau chiefs under Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' signature. <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> testified that he had written that letter also and sent it to Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who he said signed it. In her statement, however, Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` While the signature is very similar to mine, I did not sign it, nor do I know who signed it.''

 Is a student of Savage Elementary a wild child? Parents seeking to a different name for the town's only elementary school say the current one gives students an undeservedly raucous reputation.

Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, made the disclosure in releasing letters from <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, have been seeking posthumous Medals of Honor for two black servicemen: Army Sgt. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who served during World War I; and <PERSON> Navy </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who died in World War II. The congressmen introduced legislation last October that would have waived the five-year statute of limitations governing the awarding of Medals of Honor, opening the way for consideration of the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> cases. But because of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> objections, the bills stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, along with 102 colleagues, wrote to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in June, and the letter released Thursday was the secretary's reply. `` It is clear that unjust discrimination existed during World Wars I and II that could well have extended to individual decisions leading to the awarding of medals in recognition of heroic actions,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> wrote. `` As you know, while there were a number of instances where black World War I and World War II service members were recognized by individual awards for heroism, none was awarded the Medal of Honor.'' Some 1.5 million blacks served in the world wars. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> emphasized that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` does not support a symbolic award'' of the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military honor He also reiterated the department's objections to bills singling out <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> `` when many other individuals might have been equally deserving. `` Nevertheless, I am willing as a result of your expressed concern to conduct further research to examine the conditions existing in the past concerning award of decorations and medals and the extent to which racial discrimination might have been part of those conditions,'' the secretary wrote. <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> also released a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will review the war records of blacks who served in World War I and received French military honors or the <ORGANIZATION> Distinguished </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s second-highest honor `` Research will be difficult because of the passage of time and the destruction of so many records in the fire at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1973,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wrote. He estimated that the review, which has already begun, would take `` in excess of six months.'' The Army research will cover servicemen from the all-black 92nd and 93rd Divisions during World War I and will attempt `` to ascertain why Sgt. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a member of the 93rd Division, was not recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for his actions in combat and for wounds received in action,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wrote. The Army will also try to identify any black World War I soldiers who were recommended for the Medal of Honor but were disapproved or received lesser awards, he said. In a handwritten footnote, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` to report back to us on the magnitude of doing something similar for WWII.'' Blacks were denied naval combat duty during World War I, making such research unnecessary, <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> said. But he said he is trying to get the Army to do similar research into black soldiers who served in World War II. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was on sentry duty one night when he killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured a stockpile of weapons, despite being severely wounded himself. He received the <PERSON> Croix </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s highest military honor. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was serving as a mess steward aboard the USS Virginia when the ship was attacked at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. After the captain was mortally wounded, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> dragged him off deck. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> then manned a machine gun and shot down two enemy aircraft. He was awarded the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the service's second highest honor, and was killed when his ship was torpedoed in 1943.

<HEAD>U.S. Grants Consular Status to Israeli Military, Trade Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced Thursday it has agreed to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> demands that officials in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arms-buying office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> receive limited diplomatic immunity after the office was investigated for illegal exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military technology. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said extension of `` consular privileges'' to about 50 of the 250 employees in the procurement mission and a trade office would probably not be retroactive. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said last month that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had been seeking in months of talks the privileges for 47 staff members of its military procurement office. They said the office has been investigated for involvement in two cases of illegal export of American military technology. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said she was unsure of the differences between consular privileges and full diplomatic immunity but that `` diplomatic immunity is more extensive than the consular status.'' Other officials said the status provides protection only for activities directly connected to a person's official functions, not for all crimes. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> defense procurement mission and the trade mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will be considered as annexes to the Israeli consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We estimate that approximately 50 Israeli officials will require consular privileges.'' `` Most other countries that conduct defense procurement activities from offices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do so from within their embassies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and are therefore covered by diplomatic immunities and privileges,'' the spokeswoman said. Members of an Egyptian military procurement office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have been given diplomatic immunity, officials said. An Egyptian military officer who worked at the office was arrested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities earlier this year in an alleged plot to smuggle missile components to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, but he was freed after claiming diplomatic immunity. He has returned to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986 reportedly sought to investigate eight Israelis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suspected of the illegal export of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs. Spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said last May that the department decided against any criminal prosecution. Another case last November involved a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company that paid fines of $ 750,000 for violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export laws by smuggling equipment and technology to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the manufacture of chrome-plated cannon barrels.

 The sister of the longest-held <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> hostage is asking <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and other country music stars to sign a birthday card to cheer her brother during captivity. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> is asking performers to sign the 1 -LCB- - by 2-foot card during rehearsals for Monday's 22nd annual Country Music Association awards show. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted March 16, 1985. He will be 41 on Oct. 27. The card will read: `` Happy birthday <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> from Music City, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. We love you and are praying for your freedom.'' `` I've asked particularly to have <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sign it because he is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s favorite,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said from her home in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. She said the card would be displayed at a ceremony on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday, and details would be released to newspapers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in hopes of reaching her `` Hopefully <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> will see it and know that he's truly not forgotten,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the government does not foresee immediate freedom for other hostages following a captive's release earlier this week. <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 60-year-old Indian citizen and resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was in good spirits following his release Monday after 20 months of captivity. A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s kidnapping and said it freed him as a goodwill gesture. His release raised hopes for the freedom of the 16 foreign hostages still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said she expected her brother to be released by the end of the year. She did not indicate, however, that she had any specific information about an impending release. The latest word on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s condition came from <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, a French hostage released in May, according to Mrs. Say. `` He said that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was strong and determined to survive, that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> felt it would be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election before he would get out and that he was gearing for that,'' she said.

<HEAD>Government Preaches Reconciliation as Guerrillas Step Up Attacks
on Capital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet-supported government on Thursday strongly advocated reconciliation with <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas after a recent escalation of rocket attacks on the capital. `` A concerted effort of all mentalities and from all walks of life is urgently needed,'' Vice President <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON> said in an interview during the two-hour flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Government press center staffers said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> would meet Monday to discuss `` important matters,'' including efforts to bring the guerrillas into a dialogue with the government. <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON>, who said he was not a party member, is one of four vice presidents named by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> four months ago in a show of broadening the base of his government. However, key positions in the government _ including the presidency _ are held by the party or by politicians closely associated with it. The guerrillas, who call themselves <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> or Islamic Holy Warriors, have steadfastly refused to deal with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. Although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has withdrawn about half the 115,000 troops deployed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the past five months, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> presence is still heavy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital. But the Soviet armor and aircraft have not deterred rocket attacks on the city. On Wednesday morning, 42 rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in less than three hours, killing 13 people and wounding 34, according to <PERSON> Qurban </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayrzad </PERSON>, the city's deputy police chief On Sept. 28, at least 33 people were killed and more than 130 wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in recent memory. Most of the casualties were caused in a single attack at a crowded bus stop. In an interview with Western reporters, <PERSON> Shayrzad </PERSON> blamed all the attacks on the guerrillas. The opinion in the streets, however, seems less certain. Several <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> civilians, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed belief that some of the rockets were fired by Soviet or Afghan troops who blamed the guerrillas in an effort to alienate support for them. Vice President <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON> said he thought a variety of political views, including those of the guerrillas, should be represented in the government. But he said he could not envision an interim government without the People's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy for <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> affairs, last month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> proposed creation of an interim government composed of impartial Afghans, including those both in the country and abroad. <PERSON> Hatif </PERSON>, a 63-year-old businessman, said any government should have both public support and the means to defend itself. Referring to <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>'s proposal, he asked: `` How would it be possible for those people who have no public support to implement their decisions? How would it be possible -LRB- for them -RRB- to come between two warring parties?'' He called the guerrillas `` irresponsible people with complicated weapons,'' and he accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of continuing to arm the guerrillas even though the Soviet withdrawal was half completed. Under terms of an April 14 agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> pledged to stop interfering in each other's domestic affairs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed as guarantors of the accord, which calls for all Soviet troops to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> police escorted three Western reporters to homes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day. The first house was occupied by a soldier, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who said four women and one boy in his family were killed when a rocket hit the wall around their home on the north edge of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. At another house in the nearby <LOCATION> Wazirabad </LOCATION> neighborhood, four girls between the ages of 2 and 9 were killed by a rocket, according to their uncle, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> said he was a political officer of the <LOCATION> Sarandoy </LOCATION>, a paramilitary police force.

 At 41, veteran hard rocker <ORGANIZATION> Iggy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pop </ORGANIZATION> is on the comeback trail with what he feels is a clearer head and more control of his music. Pop left the music scene in 1982, disillusioned after a 14-year career. He resurfaced briefly with the 1986 album, `` Blah Blah Blah.'' `` I realized the way I was approaching my life and work had become untenable,'' he said in a recent interview. `` I could n't go on saying, ` Let's get a couple of grams of blow and write a song. Let's get stoned before the gig. Let's get stoned after the gig. I'm in town, where are the girls?''' he said. `` I was living the classic wild style, and that was no longer working for me.'' Pop said that lifestyle `` crept up on me slowly for years, and it was a lot of work to change my way of thinking. I'm not AA or anything. My ethic is that I work hard, do what I do under my own power, and at the end of the day, like everybody else in the world, I do what I can get away with.'' Pop, who performs Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, has just released the album `` Instinct.'' Admitting it may be `` too steaming, too overdrive,'' he nonetheless says he's proud that `` it's me, it's honest.''

We're a live band, and that's more important to me than the records.'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said `` U2 Rattle and Hum'' will show a side of him unknown to those who've never seen the band live. `` Being on a stage is a special place, a place apart.

 A parochial school teacher was shot and seriously wounded Thursday when her sister entered the classroom, told about 10 children to move back, then opened fire, police and witnesses said. No children in the sixth-grade classroom at Most Pure Heart of <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> were hit. Police said the wounded teacher, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 35, was hit at least once in the midsection as several shots were fired from a pistol. She was taken to Mobile Infirmary, where she was listed in serious but stable condition. Less than an hour after the shooting, the teacher's sister, <PERSON> Arilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lelande </PERSON>, 29, was charged with first-degree assault, Sgt. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The shooting stemmed from `` an ongoing domestic problem between the two sisters,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` It was n't anything like somebody walking off the street.'' The pupils said the woman with the gun told them to `` get back'' before turning to Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was seated at her desk. `` I want my money,'' the children quoted the woman as saying before firing. `` I saw the children running and crying,'' said <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDell </PERSON>, a traffic officer at the school. `` I went to them and they told me the teacher had been shot.'' `` I saw the car speed out of the road with a woman driving. She almost hit two kids,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McDell </PERSON> said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> spotted Miss Lelande driving a few blocks away from the school. `` I stopped her,'' he said. `` She got out of the car, handed me the gun, which was still cocked and loaded, and said, ` Here it is.''' `` She asked me not to leave her car in the street, to have it towed in because people in the neighborhood would tear it up,'' <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> said. The first officer to arrive at the scene of the shooting, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Henebry </PERSON>, said the teacher was conscious and told him, `` My sister shot me.'' Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school, which has an enrollment of 180 in grades one through eight, said most children were returned to the school later in the morning, but classes were called off for some.

<TEXT>
 The Grand Federal Edifice, the centerpiece of last year's Constitution Day parade in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was dismantled Thursday amid its creators' anger at the city's failure to find it a permanent home. The $ 100,000 recreation of a float that first rolled through <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s streets on July 4, 1788, has stood in orphaned grandeur among prison buses and police cars on a city parking lot for much of the past year. Members of the Carpenters' Company and the <ORGANIZATION> Architectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodwork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> built the float with the intention that it could be displayed as a lasting memorial of the bicentennial of the Constitution. But the city, which was given the float after the Sept. 17, 1987, parade, has n't received a proposal for its display by someone who could care properly for it, officials said. `` We really had everyone's interest in mind,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` We did n't have any intention of letting -LRB- the float -RRB- be destroyed.'' For example, he said, `` There's no point in placing it in a park. No one would maintain it, and it would be destroyed in two years.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobler </PERSON> of the woodwork institute said some proposals rejected by city officials would have been suitable. `` They could n't make up their minds what to do with it,'' he said. A city crane helped workers take apart the 36-foot-tall temple bearing the motto `` In union the fabric stands firm.'' It will be stored at a suburban warehouse, repaired and eventually _ its creators hope _ turned over to someone who will display it. `` We silly people would like to keep it in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemmer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carpenters </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a social organization rooted in a powerful 18th-century craft guild that built the original edifice. Topped by a plaster statue of <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION>, the Roman goddess of agriculture, the float was pulled through rainy streets by eight gray draft horses during the 1987 parade. Its troubles, however, began hours after the parade when <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION> was toppled by some overhead wires. Crippled, it was parked across from the southeast corner of City Hall. Merchants complained, so it was moved to a construction site a block away and then to the city parking lot where it stood until Thursday. Finally, with the float's seams splitting and molding rotting, <PERSON> Clemmer </PERSON> asked the city to give it back.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday passed legislation designed to end the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' trusteeship over <ORGANIZATION> Palau </ORGANIZATION>, the last western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island nation still covered by the trusteeships set up by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1947. The bill, sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a 406-11 vote, would authorize the president to enter into a compact of free association with <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> once the <LOCATION> Micronesian </LOCATION> nation of 14,000 people approves the plan. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> is a strategically important area that could host <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and naval bases if a new defense basing agreement can not be worked out with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Under the proposed compact, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would gain basing rights in <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> and would be responsible for defending the islands. The future of the legislation was uncertain as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> worked toward adjournment next week. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said key members of the panel are opposed to the plan drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s insular and territorial affairs subcommittee The aide said the main problem involves about $ 40 million in assistance to <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in addition to the $ 460 million in aid over 15 years that was contained in 1986 legislation approving the proposed compact. Senators are taking the position that the 1986 agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on the compact-approval bill still stands and that if <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> wants more money, it can return later to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, according to the aide. House committee leaders, including Chairman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON>, the delegate from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, have quoted <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> officials as saying the extra $ 40 million is needed to ensure compact approval by <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> voters Palauans have held six plebiscites since 1982, but each has fallen short of approving the free association arrangement that is similar to ones the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has with two other former trust territories, the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and the Federated States of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. The problem in <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> is that nation's constitutional prohibition against nuclear weapons on its territory. Each plebiscite has won a majority but came up short of the 75 percent support needed to overrule the no-nukes provision. The compact process has seen the killing of one <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> president, the recent suicide of another, deep political divisions, reports of intimidation and harassment of compact opponents and allegations of governmental corruption. The extra money proposed by <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON> would pay for anti-drug programs and special auditors to monitor the Palau government. Their bill also would authorize <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> to use $ 28 million in compact funds to help pay off a controversial power plant that figured prominently in corruption allegations.

 This news story can tell your age. You're 50 or older if these words move you to memories of staring at a mahogany box and hearing: _ `` Tai n't funny, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>.'' _ `` Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and all the ships at sea. Let's go to press!'' _ `` The house lights are being dimmed. In a moment, the great gold curtain will go up.'' _ `` Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!'' That, of course, was radio _ radio in its primest time, the 1940s and 1950s, when cities would fall silent and a visitor strolling the tree-lined streets of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, on a summer's evening, could catch, without missing a beat, the 15-minute drama of <ORGANIZATION> Amos </ORGANIZATION>' n' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> pouring out of living room windows In the Depression years, one-third of a nation tuned in. A nostalgia-bathed exhibit opening Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portrait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> recalls the pioneers of radio and television and the programs that generations of Americans tuned in on and grew up with. The show's curator is <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a historian of the 19th century who got her doctorate in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> studies. She is a baby boomer, and, although she thinks she remembers `` The Shadow'' -LRB- `` Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?'' -RRB-, her earliest firm memories are of television's Kuklapolitans and of the men in gas station attendants' uniforms who used to bring on <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>. `` It is nostalgia to you,'' she told a visitor 10 years her senior. `` But it's history to me.'' Off and on for five years, Ms. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> scoured the closets of broadcasters for artifacts. She put the show together with help from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. It will run through Jan. 2. The exhibit's museological purpose is not to wallow but `` to trace the impact of radio and television personalities on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture'' from the turn of the century to the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy-Nixon </ORGANIZATION> debate. The museum says the inventions of radio and television are about as important as <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' landing in the New World. Visitors will watch televisions giving snippets of early broadcasts, such as <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntley </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>, paired up for the first time to cover the 1956 political conventions. They stayed together to serve up the news for many years. Their signoff _ `` Good night, <PERSON> Chet </PERSON>.'' `` Good night, <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' _ became a national coda, recited in schoolyards. There's familiar stuff here. A boyish <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> drily comments, in a 1956 snippet, that the delegates did not clear the aisles when the chair asked them to clear the aisles. No doubt, he made the same observation this summer, eight pairs of conventions later. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Garroway </PERSON> is there, too, at the first `` Today'' show, with <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Muggs </PERSON>, a chimpanzee who bit everyone. His palm upraised, <PERSON> Garroway </PERSON> signs off again saying `` Peace.'' In 1952, television at 7 a.m. was a radical idea. The exhibit offers artifacts of broadcasting: a <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> gown, a <LOCATION> Howdy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doody </LOCATION> puppet, <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallee </PERSON>'s megaphone, <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s German Professor costume, a bejeweled Liberace outfit, <PERSON> Garroway </PERSON>'s bowtie. It's a clip-on. Radio buffs get to see what they did not need to see _ photographs of those who widened their world. They get to see the device that created an awful racket when <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> reached for the door to the hall closet at 79 <ORGANIZATION> Wistful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION>, and millions of Americans, at their radios, tensed. What made that noise of a closetful of possessions falling atop <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> was a chicken-wire covered barrel, churned by a sound effects man. <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>, would respond, `` Tai n't funny, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>,'' and people everywhere chuckled because it was funny. As for those other catchlines of radio: _ `` Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and all the ships at sea.'' That was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON>, the inventor of the gossip column, signing on for 15 minutes of frenzied chatter, his finger clattering a telegraph key between items, and hot news introduced with a barked `` Flash!'' Twenty million people tuned in. _ `` The house lights are being dimmed.'' That would be <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, introducing the Metropolitan Opera to a nationwide audience, most members of whom probably never would see the inside of an opera house. His virtuoso performance, every Saturday afternoon for 45 seasons, demonstrated the democratization of culture that radio made possible. _ `` Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!'' With that fading call, the Lone Ranger, who fought evil in the old West with silver bullets, galloped off. He and his ever-faithful Indian companion, <LOCATION> Tonto </LOCATION>, played on radio for 2,956 episodes, from Jan. 30, 1933, to Sept. 3, 1954. They lasted on television from 1949 until 1957. Many entertainers could n't make the move to the new medium. Funnyman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was one who flopped on television. `` On a radio broadcast, anything goes,'' he told Life magazine. `` You can have a man walking up the side of a building like a spider. You merely plant a suggestion in the listener's mind and his imagination supplies all the details, all the scenery, props, extras and costumes.'' But, as for television, said the acerbic <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>: `` They call television a medium because nothing on it is ever well done.''

 <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said Thursday that a weight was lifted from his heart when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to give him back pay and benefits denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> because he lied about his age and enlisted during World War II when he was only 12. But <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who was injured aboard the USS South Dakota during the battle of <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION>, says he's still crossing his fingers that the legislation will clear the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before it adjourns for the year _ possibly as soon as next week. `` It's not that much money,'' he said from his home in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's the pride of the thing to me _ that would be worth a lot to me.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was discharged from the military 45 years ago when he returned from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and was thrown into the brig because of his age. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was denied his mustering out benefits and was granted disability status for one tooth, although he claims he lost all of his teeth after shrapnel ripped through his mouth at <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION>. The legislation, approved on a unanimous voice vote Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would compensate <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> with $ 18,000 for his mouth injury and give him mustering out benefits of $ 4,917. The military in 1980 offered to give <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> back pay and mustering out benefits of $ 337 _ what he would have received upon his discharge in 1943. But Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, worked to get <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> compensated in 1988 dollars, with interest. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, meanwhile, is attempting to get the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to act quickly on <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s behalf and has asked Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., to help move the bill out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that he chairs The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 granted <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> an honorable discharge, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s story was the subject of a CBS television movie, `` Too Young the Hero,'' earlier this year, and <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said he believes the publicity finally stirred <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into acting. The bill had been introduced four or five times previously. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> rejoined the service when he reached the proper age and served with the Marines during the Korean War. He is now confined to a wheelchair from injuries suffered during a fall from a pier in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> years ago.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will probably meet with Chinese leaders early next year and also plans to visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister in charge of contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was asked whether a Soviet-Chinese summit would follow a meeting this year between the two foreign ministers, and whether the summit would occur in the first half of 1989 as Chinese reports have indicated. `` My sense is that one might be in a position to suggest that both would be the case,'' <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> replied at a news conference. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been at odds since the 1960s. <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> held the last summit in 1959. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has taken several actions that opened the way to better relations, including withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, reducing troop strength on the Chinese border and agreeing in August to the first direct talks with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Quichen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> met with the Soviet foreign minister, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, last month and plans to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> later this year, but no date has been set. <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation, will be high on the agenda <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> has represented the Kremlin in the talks with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He did not say whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> or Chinese leaders would visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> broached the idea of a summit in a speech Sept. 16 in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> told reporters the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hopes relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can be based on `` friendship and good-neighborliness.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will fulfill a commitment made by <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Genital Warts Are Epidemic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A virus is causing an epidemic of genital warts and appears to underlie the rise in cervical cancer, a doctor said at a science writers' meeting. `` It is now clear that transmission of these viral agents has reached epidemic proportions,'' Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoolnik </PERSON>, an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday at the meeting held by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The infection, known as papilloma virus, is a group of 46 viruses that cause warts. Of the dozen or more of the viruses that cause genital warts, five have been firmly linked to pre-cancerous changes in cervical cells. The cervix is the opening of the uterus. The five viruses are often missed by traditional pap smear examinations. But, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve a test within weeks that detects the virus with far greater accuracy and can determine when a very dangerous form of the virus is present, <PERSON> Schoolnik </PERSON> said. Genital papilloma virus infections are the most common sexually transmitted disease in many communities, more frequent than syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes, he said. <PERSON> Schoolnik </PERSON> called the infection `` the sexually transmitted disease of the'90s,'' following herpes in the'70s and deadly AIDS in the'80s. The rate of genital warts has increased six fold in the past 10 years, he said. A survey of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area adolescent clinics found that 20 percent of sexually active girls between 14 and 18 years old were infected by the virus, said <PERSON> Schoolnik </PERSON>, who conducted the survey. Last year, 14,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women were diagnosed with cervical cancer, which can be cured if detected early but is fatal if left untreated.

 A woman who claimed her $ 10 million <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lotto </LOCATION> jackpot on Thursday said the money will give her a sense of security but she has no plans to quit her job. <PERSON> Elynor </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, 67, said she went to work Sunday, the day after the jackpot drawing, at the turnstiles at the <ORGANIZATION> Calder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Race </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Course </ORGANIZATION> clubhouse and waited until Monday to tell her neighbor. `` I woke my friend <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> up and told her. I guess it was about 10 after eight so it was a little early for her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said during a news conference. `` She said, ` If you came up here at this hour of the morning there must be something wrong,' and I said ` Yeah, I'm rich.' I think I started to tear up a little bit.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, 67, moved to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from near <LOCATION> Pottsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in 1959. She has lived in <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> for about 12 years. She said she has stepchildren living in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> but did n't say how many or where they lived. When she correctly picked the six winning numbers last week, the jackpot had been advertised at $ 9 million, but it was boosted to $ 10.04 million by vigorous sales, which means she will collect $ 502,000 a year for 20 years. She also has won the daily numbers game, called CASH 3, three times since it started in January, said lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also announced that this week's Lotto jackpot has been boosted from $ 8 million to $ 10 million because sales of the $ 1 tickets were even with last week's. Mrs. <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said she did n't have any system for picking her winning numbers, which were 16, 20, 27, 31, 40 and 41. She has no specific plans for spending the money. `` It's a little early to decide that now,'' she said. `` It will probably give me a sense of security since I will be able to collect this for 20 years.''

 An exultant <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> flew home to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Thursday, taking new jibes at <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s need for `` job training'' while accepting fellow Democrats' accolades for his performance against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the vice presidential debate. `` Last night, the eyes of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the whole nation were on you, and they liked what they saw,'' Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> before a cheering crowd in this rural East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> community. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who usually campaign separately, united for the joint post-debate rally. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> normally introduces <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when they do appear together, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> followed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the microphones this time. `` After listening to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> last night, I can understand why he kept talking about job training,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, getting a roar from the 2,500 people in a lakeside park. Across the lake was a steel factory that he said has lost thousands of jobs to foreign competition. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Republicans do n't want to talk about that. `` My friends, if you do n't speak of these concerns, you're endangering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator appeared elated by poll figures suggesting most television viewers thought he won the debate. `` Gee, those polls were great, were n't they?'' he told reporters traveling with his campaign. `` Well, I knew I scored some points, and I thought I was winning, but it's difficult to be objective about yourself.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign planned to take advantage of what they felt was a clear <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> debate victory by airing new television spots questioning <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications for the presidency, said <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' press secretary. The flash point of Wednesday night's debatge came when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> he was `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> acknowledged that the topic had been raised during his preparations, but denied his answer was a `` canned'' response. `` What happened there was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> kept comparing himself with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, just overreaching himself, and I got fed up with it,'' he said. `` I deeply resented him trying to put <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mantle over himself when he did n't have a record that compared with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' Democratic party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who traveled to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, said he was surprised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> compared himself with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, even though the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator had done so on the campaign trail before. `` It was so transparent I did n't think he had the gall to bring it up,'' he said. But once that happened, `` he was fair game,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said, dismissing Republican complaints that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was mean. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> together in 1948. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> served three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before dropping out of politics for 16 years to pursue a business career. The debate reinforced the doubts many people had about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> contended. `` The polls show that those that were concerned about his qualifications for the presidency had that buttressed by the debates last night,'' he said. He disputed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s contention that the debate showed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> running away from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` No, I came to his defense many, many times. I talked about how proud I was to be on the ticket with him,'' he said. After days of tension, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was relaxed and chatted with reporters at length on the campaign jet. Among other things, he listed what he would do if he suddenly had to take the reins of power _ including quick action to make sure the Soviets did n't try to take advantage of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crisis. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been criticized by Democrats for failing to give a detailed answer when asked that question several times during the debate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said one of the last things he did before heading to the hall on Wednesday night was to gather his wife and children in his hotel suite and pray. He would n't say what he did afterward to celebrate, except to say there were `` a lot of hugs.'' After the Lone Star rally, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where he planned private meetings, a fund-raiser, and rest. He then planned to campaign through Saturday almost entirely in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the Democrats still trail despite his presence on the ticket.

 Members of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s inner circle enthusiastically agreed Thursday with <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' But they gave less support to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's own claim of friendship with the late president. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in the 1960 presidential campaign and later in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said he found <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s effort to compare himself to the late president `` both laughable and pathetic.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can cite age, family wealth, years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and political ambition to support his claim that his experience is similar to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s when the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator ran for president 28 years ago. But when he drew the comparison during the vice presidential debate Wednesday night, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> quickly retorted: `` I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I knew <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' Republicans, jumping to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s defense, branded <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s remark `` a cheap shot,'' while Democrats denounced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s `` audacity'' for comparing himself to the late `` I agree with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' said former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> speechwriter <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>. `` I have a feeling it was a pretty widespread sentiment.'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said, `` I do n't suppose the number of years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> makes an awful lot of difference. It's a question ofwhat you've done with them and what kind of human being you are ... <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> happened to be a much more intelligent, better-informed human being.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, when asked if he recalled any close relationship between <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, said the Texan `` was considered by us a friend.'' However, <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said, `` I do n't recall them being quite that friendly. ... I'm sure he knew him and they worked together.'' The research section at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said files of White House correspondence between <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was in private business in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was president, turned up only routine requests for autographed pictures. Much of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s correspondence from the period when he and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> served together in the House was missing, a researcher said. Historian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` has come to be a kind of landmark president'' still revered by Americans even though he served less than three years before he was assassinated. `` His image was always so sharp and compelling that it lingers in the national memory,'' he said. That may explain why Republicans cite <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> about as often as Democrats do. Turning to the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> comparison with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said, `` Literally, their careers are comparable. But the big difference was that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, probably because of his father and good luck and so on, had been involved in national and international politics for years. `` For example, he had been speaking up against colonialism, much to the annoyance of the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> administrations.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s father had been <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> also cited what he called the `` extraordinary'' way that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s memory has been `` resilient and enduring.'' `` It's partly a mystery, but somehow <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> became symbolic of the American's last idealized picture of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as young, adventurous, headed towards greatness, great purpose, all the rest of it,'' he said. When he spoke to a sixth grade class recently in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, `` all they wanted to ask about was <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was jostled, booed and called a traitor Thursday as he campaigned for undecided voters in this traditional stronghold of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> go home!'' chanted scores of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters dressed in blue-and-white party hats and waving <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> banners at the 65-year-old <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as he entered an open-air vegetable market. They taunted <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> for conciliatory policies toward the <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, especially his proposal to trade parts of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for peace. The crowd of about 400 surged toward <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who was knocked off balance several times but unharmed. Police linked arms to protect <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, and security guards grabbed a man who tried to hurl a tomato. The Labor leader told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` It demonstrates a certain style that a better part of the Israeli people do not like to see.'' The crowd was made up mostly of young Sephardim, or Jews whose familes immigrated from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries and who now account for a slight majority of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 3.4 million Jews. They voted heavily for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> in the 1977 elections and ended 29 years of rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was dominated by Askenazi Jews originating from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a meeting with party workers, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> acknowledged that the working-class town of 37,000 residents, including 5,300 Arabs, had been a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> stronghold but said `` we hope to change that.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> then set out on a 90-minute walk down <ORGANIZATION> Herzl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, the main commercial throughfare. He sought out voters who said they had not made up their minds or who had voted for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> in the past. Independent pollsters estimate the undecided account for more than 20 percent of the electorate and could determine the outcome of the Nov. 1 balloting. To retirees, housewives, shopowners and the unemployed his message was the same: keeping the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would mean annexing a large Palestinian balance that would threaten the Jewish nature of the state. `` We must n't lose the Jewish majority in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> wins, there will be an Arab majority. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> does n't want a Palestinian state, but he will bring one about,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> argued. He noted 3.5 million Jews and 2.4 million Arabs already lived in Israeli-held territory and the populations would be nearly equal early next century. At one point, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> stopped a housewife in her 20s and persuaded her to put out a cigarette she was smoking. `` I smoked for 40 years, but I quit and now I feel much better,'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, a reformed three-pack-a-day puffer. But he had more difficulty in getting her vote. The woman said she had been forced to leave her home in the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> when the land was returned to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` Because of the territories, it's difficult for me to vote for Labor,'' she said.

<HEAD>Senators Seek Independent Probe of Savannah River Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Four senators on Thursday asked an independent committee to review safety and operations at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> facility that produces nuclear weapons material. The plant, run by E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> under contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, has come under increasing scrutiny since disclosures last week that as many as 30 major mishaps there over three decades had not been reported to department headquarters or disclosed to the public. The alleged questionable safety and operating procedures, detailed in internal documents from <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> and the department, continued until this August, when the latest incident caused engineers to shut down the P-Reactor at the plant. The facility's other two reactors also have been shut down `` We are very concerned about both the August 1988 incident at P-Reactor and earlier incidents discussed in a recently disclosed 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> memorandum,'' said the letter, signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore They called for an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> and was established by Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear facilities. <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> expressed concern over the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to notify him during the August incident, according to detailed report on the mishap released Thursday by the department. The report concluded that despite a power pulse, `` there was no accident, no near-miss, and the reactor was not out of control.'' `` The decision was made to shut down P-Reactor, a strategic defense facility, even though no imminent safety hazard was present,'' said the report, prepared by a committee headed by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamric </PERSON>, assistant manager for projects at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The report found that engineers starting P-Reactor on Aug. 7 miscalculated the amount of xenon and tritium in the reactor and used an unorthodox method of adjusting two of the rods used to control the nuclear reaction. The reactor experienced a small power pulse, or `` blip,'' the next day. The reactor was shut down on Aug. 17 under orders from officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A detailed analysis disclosed that `` two full weak control rods -LRB- 35A and 53F -RRB- were found to be at their full up position when they should have been fully inserted,'' the <PERSON> Hamric </PERSON> report said. `` No reason nor accurate time for the occurrence was annotated in the operating logs.'' As a fix, operators `` drove rods 35A and 53F back to their original positions by using ... a device for positioning single rods by bypassing their normal control signal path,'' the report said. ` A concise and clear log entry was not made,'' it said. `` Such joint movement of control rods had never previously been seen by this operating shift, but restart continued normally.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said company officials had not yet seen the <PERSON> Hamric </PERSON> report but have moved to correct some of the deficiencies. `` Some of these problems have been identified,'' spokesman <PERSON> Clif </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` We have been thinking about making these changes for some time.'' <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, head of the independent committee, was informed of the unusual procedures not by Du Pont or <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, but by a newspaper reporter who called him on Aug. 16, the report said, and he `` was surprised to learn of the situation at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' The following morning, <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> sent a request by telecopier asking du Pont and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for full information, the report said. <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON> was out his office Thursday and did not respond to inquiries from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration responded quickly and with jubilation Thursday to the vote in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to reject President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bid to extend his 15-year rule. But the head of a private research group said the margin of victory for the general ` s opponents _ 54.7 percent to 43 percent _ was too narrow to finish him off politically. `` The old fox is in good shape,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Birns </PERSON>, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and Socialist opposition is divided, and that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> could run in next year's election and defeat separate candidates. `` The opposition did not crush <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Birns </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Those on the extreme left and the extreme right probably will resume violent activities, which were suspended for the period of the election This could produce a situation where <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> can say the chaos I predicted is returning to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and the state of emergency has to be reimposed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, voiced pleasure with the way the referendum was conducted and appeared to bless the results, as well. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the voting was `` an important step toward democracy.'' She also praised the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government for accepting the results. `` We congratulate the people of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> for having given the world such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` They turned out in exceptionally high numbers and took part in an exemplary voting process which they helped administer.'' Her statement also credited the Chilean armed forces with protecting the polling places and said they had guaranteed order `` in an admirable manner.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s supporters and opponents to work together to build `` a new national consensus.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration was `` pleased with the process ... of the plebiscite and we congratulate the Chilean people on carrying this forth.'' The spokesman refused to comment on the results directly, saying, `` We wo n't comment on individual Chileans and who won or lost _ but we think they are on the right track.'' `` We welcome the democratic process and we hope that it will be carried out peacefully and effectively in the next year,'' he added. Asked if the administration believed that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would move toward democratic elections, the spokesman said of the Chilean president, `` He's indicated he will accept it and work toward elections a year from now, and we hope that's the case.'' The elections would be held in December 1989. Had <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> won the referendum he could have remained in office until 1997. Before the balloting, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, did not disguise their distaste for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and underscored that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> favored a free and fair election. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> registered concern that the government would interfere with the balloting. On Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the department had received and welcomed assurances from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> that the outcome of the plebiscite would be respected. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, who will end his assignment in November, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Monday that he would leave happier if <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> were defeated in the plebiscite. `` I look forward to coming back in March 1990, when the first democratically elected president would be inaugurated, if the ` No' wins, rather than having to wait until 1997,'' the 62-year-old ambassador was quoted as saying

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> celebrated German-American Day Thursday with a call for the removal of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, which he called `` a horrendous scar,'' dividing East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in remarks to a gathering of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German officials in the Roosevelt Room of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the `` shared principles of democracy and liberty'' that have sustained the two allies for 40 years. `` Unfortunately, for Germans as well as Americans, a horrendous scar continues to mar the hopes and prospects of a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, free of totalitarian shackles,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president called the post-World War II division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, symbolized by the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, a `` cruel and unnatural division.'' `` The wall ... stands as a gash dividing those who hope, and those who despair, and those who are free to do as they may, and those who do only what the state will allow,'' the president said. `` Once again, I implore those in the East to remove this stain on human decency,'' he said. `` Release those bonds and some day there will be one united and free <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be even further enriched by the great <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people.''

<HEAD>Israel Will Vaccinate All Residents Under 40 Against Polio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health officials will vaccinate every Israeli up to the age of 40 against polio following an outbreak of the disease that affected at least nine people, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. About 3.2 million residents will be innoculated, and the program should be completed in a month, ministry spokesman <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said. It will cost about $ 3.1 million. `` We hope this will help to calm people down,'' <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said. `` We are calling on the public not to panic and not to try to be innoculated privately. There is enough vaccine in the country for everyone.'' The government undertook the campaign after hearing recommendations from a team of international health experts called to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for consultations after nine patients were diagnosed with polio, <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said. There are another three unconfirmed cases of the disease, he said. The outbreak of polio, thought to be wiped out in the country, was a surprise to Israelis, who are innoculated rountinely as infants. The new vaccination is an additional booster. Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord. It is accompanied by paralysis of various muscle groups. Just weeks before the Israeli polio cases were reported last month, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, to which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> belongs, was considering declaring the disease eradicated in the region. No cases were reported in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year and only one case was reported in 1986. The recent cases have been blamed on overflowing sewage. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s health officials are now considering changing the method of routine childhood vaccination from the live-virus <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> to a combined innoculation of <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> and the dead-virus <LOCATION> Salk </LOCATION> vaccine. No final decision has been made, <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said. Since the polio was first identified last month, about 500,000 Israelis have already received a booster vaccination, <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said They include residents of affected areas and all soldiers in the army. The next stage of the innoculations will start Friday in the northern towns of Acre and in the <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION> area, where the polio virus was found in sewage. A separate series of tests will determine whether the boosters should be administered in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Algrabli </PERSON> said. He said tourists planning to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> do not need to be innoculated.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on the organization and the issues it supports show the vice president has aligned himself with the `` darkest forces'' in the nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> demonstrates he is `` willing to toy'' with Americans' civil liberties that are protected by the Bill of Rights, said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s national chapter While the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is used to criticism, the group `` does n't expect that kind of nonsense from a major candidate,'' <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said at a luncheon. `` He has aligned himself with the darkest forces,'' <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments reflect his ignorance of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s mission. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in trying to paint his Democratic opponent, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as a far-out liberal, has cited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' long-time membership in the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. In his first debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I do n't agree with a lot of, most of the positions of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>.'' Though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has prompted an outpouring of spontaneous support for the group, <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said he feared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expressions could create a climate of fear in which it was acceptable to attack civil liberties While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has expressed his support for civil liberties, <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said he was disappointed that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor failed to vigorously defend the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in the televised debate between the two presidential candidates. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried to hide,'' <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said, is a non-partisan group with 250,000.

 A judge in a freedom-of-the-press case has barred any mention of a lawyer's <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> membership in front of the jury because of the criticism the organization has received during the presidential campaign. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> issued the ruling Monday at the request of lawyers for <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, who contends he was punished by his high school in 1987 for attacking the school's drug policy in the student newspaper.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> man attacked by a convicted murderer on furlough from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison said Thursday he will recount his experience in advertisements for a pro-George <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> group in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he has agreed to tape radio ads this weekend for the Committee for the Presidency. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he is n't sure whether his wife, <PERSON> Angi </PERSON>, who was raped by the attacker, would accompany him. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and his then-fiance, of <LOCATION> Oxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were attacked in April 1987 by <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who had fled <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> while out of prison under that state's furlough program. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> broke into <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' house, tied him up and slashed his stomach 22 times, then beat up his fiance and raped her twice. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his Republican presidential campaign, has repeatedly cited the incident to underscore his argument that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, is soft on crime. `` I'm not doing this for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> auto dealership where he is service manager. `` I'm going for an independent committee. I volunteered. This is not a case of someone exploiting victims. I want to get my piece said.'' While acknowledging that his agreement to tape the advertisements was tantamount to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsement, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said, `` I'm not telling anyone who I'm voting for. `` This is not political. I would have the same problem with this man -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- if he was running for plumber of the year,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` It's unconscionable to me that this man -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- has n't even apologized to my wife That's what's mobilizing me. He did n't even drop me a line. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> emphasized that he is not opposed to prison furlough programs in general _ only those that release first-degree murderers sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he understood the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> group was composed of conservatives from both major parties. However, the committee is an independent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign started by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, the former star first baseman for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION>, to help the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said he planned to leave Thursday for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, a trip that will be paid for by the Committee for the Presidency. He said he is n't sure whether his wife will travel with him, adding that she is still haunted by the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stitzenberger </PERSON> said he expects the radio ads will be used in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who in March suspended the furlough program for murderers serving life without parole, has attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for politicizing the tragedy. `` This is an effort to use the one case with a tragic occurrence for political reasons,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- knows that the federal government has a very extensive furlough program, knows that Governor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the'70s had a very extensive furlough program and tragedies as a result of that.''

<HEAD>Congresswomen Push For Medicare Mammography Screenings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government should provide Medicare reimbursement for the full costs of elderly women's mammography screenings, the X-ray tests that can detect breast cancer early and sharply reduce death rates, two congresswomen said Thursday. `` We need to promote preventive medicine, not just pay for care once an illness has set in,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> said the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, enacted into law earlier this year, included a $ 50 reimbursement provision for the X-ray technique used to detect lesions within the breast. `` A $ 50 mammogram is not readily available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the congresswoman said. `` The average cost for a mammogram ranges from $ 80 to $ 200.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> said the only place women can receive mammograms for $ 50 is mobile van clinics. `` Most women, especially older women, simply will not submit to being examined by a stranger in a van in the parking lot of a shopping mall,'' she said. `` Not only is a woman more likely to undergo the test when under the care of someone she knows and with whom she is comfortable, but doctors are more able to identify changes over time, and are able to provide the analysis, counseling and follow-up that are necessary to effectively care for patients,'' she said. A bill introduced by Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON> would remove the $ 50 cap, making Medicare coverage for mammogram screenings the same as for mammograms for women already diagnosed with breast cancer. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., said introducing the legislation now, near the end of the year's legislative session, will help `` put it first in line so they ca n't shove it aside'' next year The Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that screening women over 65 could reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by 50 percent after five years, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>. `` Breast cancer took the lives of 45,000 women in 1987, of which 28,000 were over age 65. Many of those lives could have been saved if mammograms were readily available and affordable to those women,'' she said at a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> recommends that women over 40 undergo mammography screenings annually.

 Four Americans threw dollar bills in the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Thursday and planned to direct a remote control toy boat across to the Laotian side in efforts to free Americans they believe are held in communist <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. The dollars, sealed in plastic envelopes, and the boat carry offers of a $ 2.4 million reward for any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoner of war brought out of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Two members of the American group were captured by <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> authorities last Sunday when they hired a fishing boat at this river town, dropped the bills into the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> and then went to a Laotian village. Thai police said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hamstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, have been moved from the Laotian village to the city of <LOCATION> Pakse </LOCATION> and possibly the Laotian capital of <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. The remaining four members of the group on Thursday threw $ 25 to $ 30 into the river, which flows on to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as a `` test'' and planned to drop more than $ 2,000 in American and other currencies Friday from the Thai shore. The boat, donated by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> toy manufacturer named <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON>, is to be steered by remote control to the Laotian shore and left there. The speedy 2.5-foot boat is festooned with a flag reading `` You MIAs -LRB- missing in action -RRB- are not forgotten.'' `` We are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will work,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, whose brother was listed as MIA in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> 22 years ago. The reward money has been pledged by 21 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen and others in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the information about it is being disseminated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, one of a number of private American MIA-POW groups. `` We do not condone private forays.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> worried that leaks from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his military chiefs' testimony would scuttle the historic nuclear test ban treaty, according to secret Oval Office tapes released Thursday. The conversations involving <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, his top advisers and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders in the summer of 1963 show a president personally engaged in the strategy, nose-counting and public relations required to push a major treaty through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s chief worry was that a hostile <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee would get the military brass to testify first in private, then selectively leak portions of the testimony to suggest that the military leaders had doubts. In the end, however, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> steered the limited nuclear treaty to an 80-19 vote and signed it in his office on Oct. 7, 1963, exactly 25 years ago Friday. The anniversary prompted the Kennedy Library to make public the material on the treaty, which was a portion of tapes whose existence was disclosed in 1973. On Aug. 12, 1963, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spoke with a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ally, Democrat <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and shared his anxiety over the positions of Sens. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> `` Scoop'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` In my opinion, the chiefs -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are the key, and what they will say in public would be more pro-treaty than what they will say under interrogation by Scoop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with leading questions and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>. The president wanted the chiefs to testfy first, in public, before the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by the more sympathetic <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wanted to head off closed testimony by the chiefs before the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Preparedness Investigation, chaired by conservative Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` What I am concerned about is that these chiefs will write in private a record which they will then feel obliged to sustain in public. Well, if we could get them on public record and publicize that to the nation, then whatever was leaked out of the committee would have much less impact.'' <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> remained worried, warning against getting <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>' back up `` Yeah, well, this is bigger than, than <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was initialed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Aug. 5, 1963, between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The three nations agreed to ban nuclear explosions in the air, underwater and on land but allowed continued testing underground. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had proposed a comprehensive ban, but Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> vetoed the idea, said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a historian at the Kennedy Library. Since 1963, the issue of a total ban has arisen several times, but the superpowers have never agreed. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said the Oval Office tapes included no dramatic revelations but supplied a close-up look at the treaty process. `` It's a mixture of so many different levels of concern: constitutional, diplomatic, political, personal,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. The tapes reveal that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was well aware of the sales job he faced to win a two-thirds ratification vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and he made sure to enlist former Presidents <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. In July, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spoke with Secretary of State Dean <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> and proposed giving a presidential speech in favor of the treaty. `` We got to hit the country while the country's hot. That's the only thing that makes any impression to these goddamned senators,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who had left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> himself just 2 -LCB- years earlier.

<HEAD>Dukakis Ads Focus On Quayle; Bush Attacks Furlough Program</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign moved quickly Thursday to exploit the vice presidential debate, releasing two television advertisements meant to cast doubt on both <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications. The ads, on the heels of Wednesday night's debate, are aimed at undecided voters concerned about whether the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator has the experience and maturity needed in a vice presidential candidate. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign hopes to lure them into the Democratic column by reinforcing those concerns. One spot, called `` Oval Office,'' depicts vice presidents <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> taking the presidential oath of office as a narrator says one out of five vice presidents has had to rise to `` the most powerful office in the world.'' `` For this job, after five months of reflection, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his personal choice _ <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' the narrator says. `` Hopefully, we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.'' The other anti-Quayle ad is part of a series called `` the packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' which features a group of actors portraying cynical <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers trying to package their product for the voters. In the latest rendition, called `` Crazy,'' the handlers complain that despite their best efforts at debate coaching, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> blew it anyway. `` We've got a disaster on our hands,'' one of the handlers says. `` Suddenly the words ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' even make me nervous,'' says another. `` Is it too late to drop him? Bring in <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>?'' asks a third. `` It's too crazy,'' says a fourth. `` It's not that crazy,'' the first one says. The ad ends with the same tagline as the four others in the `` packaging'' series: `` They'd like to sell you a package. Would n't you rather choose a president? <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> survived the debate with no noteworthy gaffes. But the consensus was that his vice presidential rival _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ was the clear victor. The two Quayle ads are part of a major <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> TV offensive that includes the `` packaging'' series and four direct hits on Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s records on the environment, drugs, Social Security and education. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also plans to introduce an ad called `` Failure,'' based on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contention that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed every mission given him in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The assignments have included leading fights against drugs and terrorism; reforming federal regulations; and bettering trade relations. Two of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s newest ads attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, for raising taxes and for letting criminals out of prison on a `` revolving door'' furlough program. Another new spot, called `` His Mistakes,'' features <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents complaining about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and concludes with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> woman saying she's going to vote Republican this year

 In the name of the almighty, The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, watching events in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, declares that the destiny of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has become within the priorities of our struggle in view of the new imperialist onslaught aimed at the revolutionary strugglers and turning it into a new <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> base. The chain of events which preceded and followed the presidential election poses the gravest stage of the conspiracy against <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, because it is not a circumstantial outcome of a domestic crisis, but part of a conspiracy by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> carried out by the mercenaries of the interior to partition <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a first step to turning it into an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> satellite and a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> base for intrigues against the people of the region and to attack steadfast <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and other revolutionary regimes. The organization calls attention that those who made <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> reach this stage and put its destiny at stake will not be satisfied with what they have accomplished. They have graver and more adventurous plans that will push the whole region to the brink and widen the scope of the conflict, especially with the rude call for imperialist intervention under the slogan of internationalization by a colonial power whose black history is mothering our present tragedies. From its revolutionary and combative stand, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declares a state of utmost alert and will not stand handcuffed. It specifies the following priorities: 1. We call the attention of all free revolutionary strugglers to the seriousness of what is happening and urge them to be vigilant and close ranks against an imperialist front plotting a black future. We urge them to forget ideological differences, because the destiny of all is imperiled. 2. We warn the conspirators and their tools that we shall mete out the just punishment to the conspirators. We shall hit the heads and nests of intrigues in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> wherever they hide, be it in the <LOCATION> Karantina </LOCATION> -LRB- headquarters of the main Christian militia, Lebanese Forces -RRB-, or Hazmieh -LRB- army command -RRB- or <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> -LRB- seat of the Maronite patriarchate -RRB-. We shall not be tolerant with the grandsons of the crusaders. We assure them that domination of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and its destiny shall remain illusive dreams from which they will be jolted by our nearing showdown. 3. We emphasize to the international conspirators that we shall use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies, including the card of the safety of the hostages, which we shall make the backbone of our confrontation. Glory is for the oppressed and immortality for the martyrs. The Revolutionary Justice Organization

 A woman who called to chat long-distance with her boyfriend listened in horror as an intruder entered and shot him to death, but police say her quick action helped them track down the suspect. During a telephone call from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 25, heard a man enter the apartment of her boyfriend, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinch </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> asked who it was and <PERSON> Tinch </PERSON> responded `` <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>,'' and continued their conversation as if he were not concerned, Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> told police. As the couple continued to talk, Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> heard <PERSON> Tinch </PERSON>, 30, tell <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> to `` put the gun down and stop playing with it.'' Tinch, a security guard, owned a .38 - caliber A short time later, Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said she heard <PERSON> Tinch </PERSON> again ask <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> to `` put it down. Do n't point it at me.'' Suddenly, there was the sound of a gunshot, she told police. `` Oh, do n't shoot me again,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> heard Tinch say. She then heard two more shots. After a long moment of silence on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> end of the line, Ms. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> hung up and dialed the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to report what she heard. Police say her actions aided them in quickly locating the assailant. When they arrived at Tinch's apartment, they found him dead, shot in the neck, abdomen and right hand. Police said they questioned neighbors about any acquaintances of Tinch named `` Rick'' and were directed to <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, who lived a short distance from <LOCATION> Tinch </LOCATION>'s apartment. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, 29, was charged with first-degree murder early Wednesday, police said. Detectives said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> told them, `` I shot him, but it was accidental. I put the gun down on the dresser and it went off.'' Asked if they knew of any motive <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> might have had to murder Tinch, police said Thursday they could not say anything more about the case.

<HEAD>Swimming Pool Supply Company Fined $100,000 in Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says it has levied the first penalty of its kind in fining a pool supply company more than $ 100,000 for failing to notify agencies of a June chlorine fire that routed 25,000 people from homes and businesses. The fines are increasing at $ 500 a day, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> attorney handling the case, said Thursday. The fines totaled $ 101,500 by the end of the day Wednesday, he said, and would continue until a report is filed. The Northeast administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON>, said Wednesday that the penalty was the first in the nation assessed for violations of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s community right-to-know law, enacted in 1986. <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> vowed to press the pool supply company until the city recovered $ 620,000 spent in fighting and cleaning up the fire. `` I'm determined to get that money,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. `` We'll obviously seek damages from their insurance company, and if they do n't have insurance, we'll seek it from them. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which does business as <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, was fined $ 25,000 plus $ 500 a day for failing to notify <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials of the June 17 accident and provide a written report. He said the company was also fined $ 25,000 for failing to notify the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's clearinghouse and response center for hazardous material emergencies, when the troubles began at the plant. A minor fire at the plant was controlled on the morning of June 17, but firefighters were called back to the scene that night when a police officer spotted flames inside the building. The subsequent blaze, fed by thousands of exploding barrels of chloride tablets, took four days to get under control. At its height it sent up a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas three miles long, 100 feet high and four blocks wide. More than 200 people were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries from the fumes. Officials estimate that 180,000 gallons of chlorine leaked. `` In light of the magnitude of the release and its impact on the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> community, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> considers the violations particularly egregious,'' <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, attorney for the company, said it will probably contest the fine and he questioned its severity, maintaining the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` in reality knew about this leak from the start.'' He also said the city must prove the company was negligent before it can collect damages. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> fine is based only on the company's failure to provide a written report to date on what chemicals spilled, how much was released and other information. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> attorney maintained the agency was summoned to the scene by state officials, not company executives, 15 hours after the incident began. The state's private cleanup contractor is also trying to recoup the cost of the cleanup, estimated at a minimum of $ 500,000. Residents and local business firms in the evacuated areas also have filed class-action suits against the company, which lawyers said could reach into the millions of dollars.

 Several hundred leftist guerrillas tossed grenades at a southern civil defense post Thursday, and a rocket grenade struck this capital's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building, damaging a stone wall. Also Thursday, a leftist political coalition announced its presidential and vice presidential candidates for next year's election One soldier was killed and three were wounded in the pre-dawn attack on <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said an army sergeant at the civil defense post. A rocket-propelled grenade also struck the wall of a stairway leading to the main assembly chamber, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cpl </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. Spectators were going up the stairs to view the morning session when the projectile struck, but no one was hurt, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which knocked a couple of stones loose and left a small hole in the wall. Up to 400 guerrillas attacked the civil defense post in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION> at 1:10 a.m., the sergeant said. His face was bandaged and his clothes still covered with blood from a shrapnel wound. `` They hit us hard, but they also have dead,'' the sergeant said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They attacked us on all sides but we managed to fight them off.'' He said 12 men were on duty at the time of the attack, which lasted three hours. He did not elaborate on the guerrilla dead and there were was no guerrilla body at the scene, as there usually is in such cases. Rebels also destroyed the local office of <LOCATION> ANTEL </LOCATION>, the state-owned telecommunications enterprise, and blew up two utility poles with transformers, causing a blackout of the surrounding area, he said. The attack was the first on <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION>, a town of 6,000, in the 9-year war pitting Marxist-led rebels against forces of the U.S.-backed government. Armed forces officers for two years have contended the guerrillas had been virtually cleared out of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libertad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION> is located. `` Until today I had only seen the war on television,'' said <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>, a 40-year-old woman who lives next to the defense post. She said spent the siege under the bed. The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three small leftist parties said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, a lawyer, would run for president and <PERSON> Reni </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON>, a physician, would be its vice presidential candidate. Ungo is also president of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella organization of four guerrilla groups. The Convergence represents the left's first participation in elections since 1977. The left until now has labeled such elections a farce, contending the civil war makes free and fair elections impossible.

 An AIDS victim who claims she contracted the disease from a transfusion at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> hospital has filed suit against the blood bank used by the hospital. The state <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suit for unspecified damages was filed late Tuesday by <PERSON> Kandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> <PERSON> Sicuranza </PERSON>, 18, against the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. She also filed an administrative complaint against the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sicuranza </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said she plans to ask $ 10 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` No amount of money is going to change the facts,'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` My daughter is going to die. But this will do what it can.'' The suit alleges the blood center negligently allowed blood from an AIDS carrier be delivered to the hospital at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, where she gave birth to a son in January 1987. She was a military dependent at the time. After the baby was delivered, Ms. <PERSON> Sicuranza </PERSON> received four units of whole blood that hospital records indicated had been screened and declared safe by the blood center, the suit alleges. Three months ago, Ms. <PERSON> Sicuranza </PERSON> learned that one of the donors who gave the blood she received had tested positive for the AIDS virus when he later tried to give blood. On her 18th birthday, Aug. 12, she was told she, too, had contracted the disease. Her son, however, is free of the disease. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, director of the blood center, declined comment on the suit, but said the facility does not pay donors and complies with all local and federal testing standards. Ms. <PERSON> Sicuranza </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, said an administrative complaint has been filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> as a prelude to a suit against that service. `` That's what federal law says you have to do, so that's what we did,'' Day said. `` They have six months to answer, which they never do. What it really is, is a six-month delay that gives them time to sort themselves out.''

<HEAD>Environmental Lobby `Scorecard' Flunks Both Vice Presidential

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite their professed support for environmental cleanup and conservation, neither vice presidential candidate fared particularly well on an `` environmental scorecard'' released Thursday by a lobbying group. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., scored 20 percent while Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, rated 40 percent, according to the League of Conservation Voters <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON>, executive director of the league, which lobbies on behalf of a number of environmental organizations, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s 20 percent score `` means he ges it wrong four times out of five.'' `` I heard him say last night that he deserved a good grade for his performance on the environment, but I guess we showed up this morning with his transcript,'' <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> said. Of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> said the Texan had rated higher in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, when the league gave him a 50 percent rating. `` We'd prefer to see it go up a lot,'' <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s score During Wednesday's debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked why he had voted `` two-thirds of the time'' against environmental protection legislation. `` I have a very strong record on the environment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, adding that he had voted for the Superfund and to override a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto of the Clean Water Act. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> derided <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s `` late conversion'' to environmentalism and charged, `` it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up ... <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' He said the Democrats were responsible for the Superfund and the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Water acts. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in turn, attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his supposedly tardy efforts to clean up the harbor, `` the most polluted waterway in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' and his plans to ship waste outside <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for disposal. The league graded <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members by tallying their votes on several issues deemed important by the league's board. The group also took into account legislators' co-sponsorship of bills, actions in committees and perception by environmentalists in their home districts. The average score in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was 47 percent, with Republicans siding with the league 37 percent of the time and Democrats, 56 percent. A new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cites the league by name, noting that it `` gave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` D'' rating and they endorsed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president.

<HEAD>Labor Reaffirms Nuclear Policy, Embarrassing Kinnock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament Thursday, rejecting party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s attempt to soften a position that has been unpopular with British voters. Labor's annual conference endorsed a resolution stipulating that a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government would scrap <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons and close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases in this country during its first five-year term. It carried by 480,000 votes in a total of nearly 6 million, much closer than previous ballots on an issue that has divided the party for decades. Union leaders cast huge block votes at annual conferences based on their memberships. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> supported a resolution that said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons could be used as a bargaining chip with the Soviets and did not set a time limit. He indicated the socialist party's leadership might ignore the vote in drawing up the nuclear weapons platform during a policy review to be completed next year. `` Today's votes ... were not conclusive,'' he told reporters Thursday night. `` It is our duty to get a defense and nuclear disarmament policy which can enjoy the support and confidence of the people of this country.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingstone </PERSON>, a leader of the Labor left, warned <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>: `` If you try and ditch this policy there will be civil war in this party.'' The defeat marked the most serious split at the conference between <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> and a left wing dismayed by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s shift to the center after three election losses to the Conservatives. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, with 1.25 million members, led opposition to what he called the `` confusion and fudge'' of the <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> resolution. It sought to keep the party's options open by calling for disarmament by `` unilateral, bilateral and multilateral means.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, party spokesman on foreign affairs, said in debate that an unconditional disarmament policy would `` mark the end of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s role in world nuclear disarmament.'' `` The question is not whether a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION> would go non-nuclear ... but how we go non-nuclear,'' he said. Labor adopted the unilateral nuclear disarmament policy in 1981, two years after losing power to <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her Conservatives. Polls indicate it was a major factor in the party's subsequent defeats <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, a lifelong campaigner against nuclear weapons, has shifted his stance in the past 18 months and now argues that the U.S.-Soviet agreement to destroy medium-range nuclear missiles has created a climate for negotiation. The superpower agreement does not affect <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons, submarine-carried <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> missiles that will be replaced in the 1990s by more potent Trident missiles Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has bought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Nuclear-capable American F-111 bombers also are deployed at two British bases and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poseidon </LOCATION> submarines, equipped with nuclear arms, operate from Holy Loch, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

 Six weeks ago, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> was so hard up he had to pedal 100 miles by bicycle to attend a world congress of fellow philosophers. Starting Thursday, <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> had a job _ as a barroom philosopher. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> is paying the 49-year-old thinker $ 8,500 to give three lectures a year at his Beehive pub in <LOCATION> Swindon </LOCATION>, 70 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> thinks the 100-year-old pub is just the sort of place where <PERSON> Socrates </PERSON>, a poor man who went barefoot, might have engaged in his philosophical dialogues in ancient <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The first talk by the bespectacled philosopher was a discourse on freedom to a good-natured, occasionally boisterous but generally reverent crowd. <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON>, a Czechoslovak dissident emigre, steered clear of Greek philosophers, dwelling instead on the meaning of freedom to a prisoner. As customers sipped their beers, <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> told of pounding on his cell door for a drink of water, being refused, and pounding again until he got it _ proof, he said, that `` wherever you are you can do something. `` You can make your freedom work, even if you're under interrogation. There's a level where you can be free, no matter what situation you're in.'' Customers applauded at the end of his talk. <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1980. He has n't been able to land an academic post, but he refused to take a job that might distract him from his beloved pursuit of ancient Greek philosophy. That led authorities to cut off his $ 114 weekly welfare check. <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON>'s plight became public at a philosophers' congress in the southern seaside town of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> in August. <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> had spent most of his money on registration fees and had cycled 100 miles from <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, where he spends his time poring over philosophical works in university libraries. His job at the Beehive pub entails giving a half-hour discourse followed by a half-hour discussion with customers. A signatory to the Czechoslovak human rights manifesto Charter 77, <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> won brief acclaim among philosophy scholars when he held `` underground'' seminars in his <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> apartment in defiance of authorities. His controversial ideas on <PERSON> Plato </PERSON>'s philosophical development, however, have been dismissed by leading British scholars as ingenious but weak. <ORGANIZATION> Swindon </ORGANIZATION> once had a poor reputation in intellectual circles. City elders banned the medieval classic `` Decameron'' in a 1954 ruling that was overturned amid nationwide uproar. One Beehive customer, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio, joked that his knowledge of philosophy amounted basically to `` I drink, therefore I am.'' But things have changed. The city of 91,000 has become the capital of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s mail-order book market, and publican <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, a red-bearded Irishman, believes <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> will further raise the tone. Opening night was by free ticket only, and all 700 tickets were snapped up. Loudspeakers were set up for crowds outside. `` Who would have thought you could get all those people to come and listen to a philosopher?'' marveled <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. He said his pub was no place for drunken displays. `` Manifestations of ignorance will never be considered a virtue in this house,'' he said. In recent interviews, <PERSON> Tomin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Plato </PERSON>, a student of <PERSON> Socrates </PERSON>, also had views on pubs. <PERSON> Plato </PERSON> complained in his Laws that they should be `` places of generosity and conviviality,'' but instead had become `` places where the publican robbed the people.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> thinks his `` visiting philosopher'' will have an important influence on his patrons. `` Rumor has it that some of them have been seen in the local bookshop buying books on philosophy recently so that at least they've got some kind of a head start,'' he said. Did he feel ancient Greek philosophy had relevance today? `` Good heavens, yes. Truth always has relevance,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> replied. `` One can not disguise it by buying flashy motor cars, one can not put tinsel over it. Truth is truth.''

 Police arrested 11 demonstrators Thursday in the third day of protests aimed at shutting down <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> abortion clinics. The demonstration was part of a week of protests dubbed `` The Siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' by the New York-based anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. This week, 368 demonstrators been jailed and protest leaders have made allegations of police brutality, denied by officials. Thirty arrested demonstrators have been released on bond, police spokesman <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. On Thursday, police dragged or carried some of the people arrested about 200 feet to a van, while sympathizers in a crowd of about 100, on the other side of a portable steel barricade erected by police, prayed or sang hymns. Seven were arrested, police said, for obstructing a car on its way to the clinic. The others were charged with failure to obey an officer. Shortly afterward, volunteers escorted a young woman up the steps to the door of the Feminist Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, while one demonstrator pleaded with her to reconsider. The woman shouted that she was going through with it, `` and I'll throw the bloody mess in your face!'' While some Operation Rescue members had pleaded with the woman to reconsider, others claimed she was `` a plant'' brought to the clinic to give the impression that it was operating normally. Clinic directors have said demonstrations have caused some women to reschedule abortions, but deny that the protests have caused a reduction in the number of appointments. Operation Rescue first appeared in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during the Democratic National Convention in July, and stayed in town for much of the summer. Since the protests began, more than 1,100 anti-abortion protesters have been jailed, mostly on trespassing charges. Police have resorted to rougher, more expedient arrest tactics this week, which has led to charges of brutality from <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> and its leader, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. Operation Rescue attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierer </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police Maj. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> of kicking a protester in the face during Tuesday's demonstration. `` There will be serious injuries if police do n't act with restraint,'' he said, and vowed to file a federal civil rights suit against <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>. A videotape of the incident, distributed to reporters by <PERSON> Fierer </PERSON>, showed <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> pushing a man with his foot or lower leg but indicated the man did not appear to get kicked and did not appear hurt. <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> on Thursday repeated the police department's resolve `` not to let the protesters close down these legal businesses.'' If protesters could close the clinics, they could close `` other businesses in your neighborhood or your church if they happen to disagree with it,'' he said. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> called the clinics `` illegitimate child-killing centers that have no right to be here. There is no negotiated settlement.''

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Chilean opposition, buoyed by its ballot-box defeat of military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, now faces the challenge of maintaining its new-found unity in advance of open elections. In addition, potentially divisive issues such as human rights trials and the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could sow dissent as opposition leaders pursue talks with the armed forces to speed the transition to full democracy. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost a plebiscite Wednesday on a proposal for him to remain in power until 1997. According to the 1980 constitution pushed through by the 72-year-old army commander's administration, open presidential elections will be held in December 1989. Furher negotiations between the military government and the opposition hinge on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s standing with his troops, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and expert on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and Latin American authoritarian governments. `` I think it depends on whether the referendum loss officially discredits him within his own service,'' <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> to observe the voting, said during a telephone interview. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> said the navy, air force and national police appear more willing to negotiate than <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s army, which has been fervently loyal to its chief. `` They are more flexible,'' <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> said of the navy, air force and national police. `` They've been predicting this'' defeat. Political maneuvering by top opposition figures for nomination to the presidency also is expected to influence relations within the 16 parties that formed a coalition to lead the anti-Pinochet campaign. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, Socialist leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION>, to run for the presidency along with someone who will represent the political right. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> helped lead the coalition, created early this year after years of bitter feuding among the opposition. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> often played on those divisions to strengthen his rule. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> insisted after the vote that unity must be maintained, and even expanded to include groups on the right and left who had been excluded in the past. `` We do n't want there to be winner and losers,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said. `` To the contrary, everyone must collaborate in the reconstruction of the country.'' `` The armed forces have an important role to play,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>' moderate leftist stance offends many conservatives, and he has hinted at a willingness to put aside presidential ambitions in the interest of a smooth transition of power. Asked if the pro-Moscow Communist Party should be included, <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said all democratic parties to the right and the left should be embraced. `` There should be no exclusions,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. Some leftist groups in the coalition favor including the Communists. However, the armed forces are fiercely anti-communist, and the 1980 constitution outlaws communist groups and the propagation of Marxist ideas. They are certain to reject the notion of sitting down at the bargaining table with anyone associated with communists. Leftist parties also are calling for justice in human rights abuse cases. More than 700 people disappeared and thousands have allegedly been tortured by security forces under <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, especially in the aftermath of the 1973 coup that brought him to power, rights groups say. Parties of the political right and center, apparently recognizing the military's fear of rights trials, have approached the issue with caution. They routinely say only that `` the truth must be known,'' implying an investigation should be conducted but not necessarily a trial involving military figures. The constitution also calls for a congress to be elected in a year but its provisions make virtually impossible any amendments. Observers believe the opposition's priority will be to ease the procedure for amending the document, leaving other, more specific changes for later. Leftist parties want it amended immediately to allow for quick elections and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rapid exit from the presidency. But <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> indicated his party was in no such hurry. `` The period could be six months, nine months, or a year,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said.

 Half the voters who watched the vice presidential debate came away still doubting Republican Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications to serve as president, if that became necessary, a national poll found Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll of 412 debate watchers also found they overwhelmingly believed the Democratic nominee, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, won the debate. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll released after the debate Wednesday reached the same finding. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> post-debate poll, up from 37 percent who rated him qualified before the debate. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did better, rated as qualified by 78 percent, up from 64 percent. Though <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s rating improved, `` I'd be worried if I was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, because he still has n't broken the 50 percent mark and this was probably his only chance to do so,'' said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. CBS found that the number of debate viewers who said they would worry about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as president was little changed _ 52 percent before the debate, 48 percent after it. Just 17 percent said after the debate they would worry about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as president, down from 22 percent before the debate. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> conducted the survey by calling back 744 likely voters it had interviewed before the debate; the results were among the 412 of them who said they had watched all or part of it. The poll had a five-point margin of error. Asked who won the debate, 50 percent in the survey chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and 27 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The result was almost precisely the same as the 51-27 percent split in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll released Tuesday put the presidential race at 48 percent for the Republicans to 46 percent for the Democrats. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said the post-debate re-survey found `` no particular change'' in that gauge.

<TEXT>
 The assembly line, which propelled <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> into automaking and industrial history, celebrates its 75th anniversary this week. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> planned a ceremony for Friday at its Wayne assembly plant. There, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s great-grandson, <PERSON> Edsel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> II, will ride off the modern-day assembly line in a Model T. In remarks prepared for Friday's events, <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, general sales manager of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln-Mercury </ORGANIZATION> division, said that as in his great-grandfather's time, the company still is striving for quality and efficiency. `` Seventy-five years ago, my great-grandfather and his associates put in place the mechanism to realize his dream of building an affordable motor car for ` the great multitude' using the best employees and materials,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Production of the famous Model T began in mid-1908, and quickly, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was determined to bring down the price of his product. Three-quarters of a century ago, and a few miles away from the sprawling <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> assembly plant, workers at a Ford plant in <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> were tinkering with an idea that would revolutionize manufacturing worldwide. On April Fools' Day, 1913, an engineer in the plant's flywheel-magneto assembly area tried out a new assembly technique that spread quickly to other component operations Then on Oct. 7, 1913, the entire process was transferred to the final assembly area. The first Model Ts to be built by the process were dragged by rope through the area as 150 workers stood in place, attaching components to the frame as it passed. Within a few years, the technique was adopted by a wide range of manufacturers. Nowadays, robots have taken the place of some workers and cars along the assembly line are raised, lowered and tilted to make access for workers easier. But amid the high technology, the car moves past the worker much in the same way it did 75 years ago.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s fever subsided Thursday after he received his daily blood transfusion.

<TEXT>
 Ethnic strife in a disputed region of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> is leading to job discrimination, segregation and an exodus from trouble spots by people of both ethnic groups, a newspaper reported Thursday. Armenians and Azerbaijanis are engaged in `` mutual dismissals'' at enterprises in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s major towns, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shusha </PERSON>, the newspaper <PERSON> Selskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhizn </PERSON> said in an article called `` Zone of Discord.'' Many of the region's 160,000 residents have become refugees, leaving jobs and homes to seek safety in areas where their nationality dominates, it said. Correspondent <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akulova </PERSON> of the daily, which appeals to a rural audience, was clearly appalled by developments in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is attached to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> but has a predominantly Armenian population. `` How many mixed marriages are there in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, how many children from parents of different nationalities? Where will they go in this ethnic conflict?'' the reporter asked. The Soviet government recently sent troops and tanks into the area to halt strikes and violence stemming from demands by the majority Armenians that it be transferred to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Violence stemming from the ethnic dispute claimed 32 lives last February in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. A delegation of lawmakers from the Soviet parliament made a fact-finding tour of the region, indicating the degree of concern in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. State radio said it ended Thursday and the group would make recommendations to the national government. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s national leadership has said sovereignty over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> will not be changed, citing <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s refusal to give up an area attached to it since 1923. According to the newspaper report, half the Armenians in <PERSON> Shusha </PERSON> fled after fires were set in several homes and Armenian refugees cram the Hotel Karabakh in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. `` Children play in the halls and soup gurgles on electric hot plates, filling the air with the aroma of a communal apartment,'' it said. Azerbaijanis also have fled, with more than 1,000 families leaving <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> for the nearby <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Agdam </LOCATION>, the paper reported. It said a 5,500-acre collective farm was split along ethnic lines, forcing residents to parcel out everything from fields to shovels and rakes.

 A little-used law allowed police to arrest a woman who refused to be treated for tuberculosis and was believed to have spread the disease to family members, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION>, was arrested Wednesday by the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and taken to <ORGANIZATION> Montebello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a state institution in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. She was in satisfactory condition Thursday and was expected to remain there for three to six months, a hospital spokesman said. Dr. <PERSON> Elin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON>, director of epidemiology and disease control for the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was arrested under a little-used provision of state law that allows public health officials to control the spread of contagious diseases. Tuberculosis, which is marked by coughing, night sweats and weight loss, can be cured, but can be fatal if left untreated, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. Health officials can not force <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> to receive treatment, but they can incarcerate her to prevent her from spreading it to others, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was described as being in a highly infectious stage of the disease, and could be jailed if she leaves the hospital, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. Several members of her family have tested positive for tuberculosis, and are expected to receive treatment, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said. The criminal warrant was issued in July, after health officials failed to find her to serve a civil injunction issued in Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Matz </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Mental Hygeine. <PERSON> Matz </PERSON> said repeated telephone calls and visits to <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s home by health officials failed to persuade her to get treatment for the disease she was diagnosed with last winter. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, said the state has the responsibility to protect the public. `` On the other hand, I do n't think state can force her to be treated. But they can keep her out of the public's way if she's going to be passing the disease frequently and easily,'' <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON> said `` If it were the cold or flu, it would be a different ballgame.'' Tuberculosis is an airborne bacteria that can be transmitted by sharing a close space with an infected person, <PERSON> Gursky </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Report More Money Needed for Satellite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may have to stop construction of a new satellite unless it can find about $ 200 million more to finish it, a newspaper reported Thursday. The satellite, designed as a communications vehicle and named for the biblical prophet <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, is being built by government-run <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and is scheduled for launch in 1993, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said. Three other papers said some army generals opposed the project because of its high cost. Official declarations have said `` Amos'' would be used primarily for civilian purposes, beaming television, radio and telephone transmissions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> is expected to decide in a few weeks whether the job can be finished. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official, speaking privately, confirmed the report but would not elaborate. The English-language Jerusalem Post Maj.-Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, the deputy chief of staff, called the project as a `` Lavi fantasy. The Lavi was a U.S.-financed jet fighter project scrapped last year because of cost overruns. Other officers objected to the new satellite because it will cost at least $ 500 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> officials were reported to have said it would cost only half that. Other reports on the army controversy appeared in the socialist newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamishmar </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials were leading the effort to obtain funds. Military and <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen refused comment. Prof. <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s space agency, said in a telephone interview: `` <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials may have objected to the expenditure, but it is a commercial, not a military problem.'' He added, however: `` Government ministries, including the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, may have been asked to purchase broadcast channels on the satellite.'' News reports said the project was conceived by the private <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> headed by former army intelligence chief <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Amit </PERSON>. The debate over `` Amos'' comes two weeks after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched its first space satellite, `` Horizon-1,'' which is said to carry surveillance equipment for possible intelligence gathering. <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON> said `` Horizon-1'' will stay in orbit through November, more than a month longer than originally scheduled. He said the flight would be extended because the craft was orbiting at a greater distance from Earth than planned.

<HEAD>Justice To Stay Out Of Suit Against Northrop Over MX Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will stay out of a private lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> which alleges the government was defrauded of more than $ 1 billion in connection with the manufacture of the MX missile-guidance system. The suit brought by eight current and former <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employees accuses the company's electronics division of intentionally delivering to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> defective inertial measurement units, which guide the MX Peacekeeper missile. The 67-page complaint unsealed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and filed in October 1987, says <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> failed to ensure that the guidance components were properly manufactured, controlled, processed and inspected. It says <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> wrongfully received $ 1 billion from the government and seeks three times that amount. In addition, four of those filing the suit seek compensatory damages. The complaint was brought under the False Claims Act, which allows private parties to bring suit on behalf of the government and gives the government the right to join a case. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has decided there is insufficient basis for it to enter the matter now. The government could enter the suit at a later time. In a related matter, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987 for $ 3 million for failing to properly test a component of the MX. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suit followed a private suit filed in 1986 by two of the eight <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employees involved in the currently pending complaint. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said `` the quality and reliability of the inertial measurement units <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> builds has been measured consistently since the MX system became operational in December 1986, and has consistently met or bettered <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> expectations.''

 Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, refining his response to what he would do if he became president, said Thursday there was `` no question'' that he would continue <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies Asked by reporters why he had not made that response during Wednesday night's debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` It was a very narrow hypothetical. ... I had n't had that question before.'' At a fund-raiser here and rally in <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his Democratic opponent, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, failed repeatedly to address `` whether he would continue the extreme liberal policies of Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he took over the presidency.'' `` He did n't answer the question. He waffled, shuffled, ducked and dived,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters he was disappointed the debate did not have more questions about foreign policy, which he said was one of his strengths. But it was the issue of his qualifications and the possibility of stepping into the Oval Office that obviously concerned the campaign Thursday, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took pains to address it in his speeches. `` When I was asked that question, I made a judgment that the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> deserved to hear me outline the level of my qualifications and the depth of my experience to assume the presidency,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I responded to that point and the core of my thinking is this: there is no question that I would maintain and build on the excellent policies of a President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' On his campaign plane, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted that he had answered Wednesday night that he would first pray and then convene a Cabinet session upon becoming president. `` By convening a Cabinet session, that certainly implies that you're going to continue the policies of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. I did not say that, but that's certainly implied,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, adding, `` I think I did just fine last night.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> criticized the `` snickering and laughing'' he said came from supporters of Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he heard them when he said during the debate that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was the `` envy of the world.'' `` I think that's going to be one of the cutting edges of this election because they look down on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in strong terms, saying that he had been unable to defend <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position and `` ran from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faster than a deer runs from a forest fire.'' `` I am proud of the man at the top of my ticket. I am happy to support his positions, and I wo n't run away from them like Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did last night,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. There were signs sprinkled at the <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> rally at <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> reading, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' a reference to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s derisive comment when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> compared his experience to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters on his plane that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s comment was `` a cheap shot.'' But asked whether he was glad the debate was over, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied, `` I'd like to have another one.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator had a long day of campaigning Thursday, with stops in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. He left <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> in an upbeat mood, saying he was not worried about an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll indicating many viewers thought he had lost the debate. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll released Thursday produced the same results. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to win the election. He's still way ahead in the polls,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, meanwhile, released two anti-Quayle television ads that struck again at his qualifications. One ad noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had chosen <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to replace him should tragedy occur and said, `` Hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was.''

 Tempers flared as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chairman accused the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday of concealing abuses in a government program designed to spur American tobacco exports. `` This is a cover-up,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, at a hearing on abuses in a credit guarantee program for farm exports. `` I resent that,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> retorted. `` I do n't care if you resent it or not,'' replied <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tobacco and peanuts subcommittee. `` You were covering up a fraudulent practice in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the program, under which <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> guarantees private companies they will be paid for American farm goods they export even if foreign buyers default. Tobacco shipments worth a total of $ 30.3 million were guaranteed under the program for 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. The controversy concerns a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general finding that 14 companies falsely told the department that all of the tobacco for which they obtained credit guarantees was American grown. Actually, some had been imported, blended with American tobacco and re-exported under the program, the report said. Initial reports of a problem emerged from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1986, bringing congressional demands for an investigation. Tobacco-state lawmakers said the program was designed to aid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers, not foreigners. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the concern. Follow-up by the inspector general, however, resulted in the allegations under investigation and which are agitating <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` It makes my blood boil,'' declared Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who said he was `` hoping that the people who have broken the law end up in the penitentiary.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> told lawmakers he was as `` infuriated'' as they were by the disclosures and said claims by exporters that their tobacco was 100 percent American may have constituted fraud. He said, however, that he had been surprised by the allegations and that he had seen no reason to question the assurances of exporters. It had always been the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to provide credit guarantees for the U.S.-produced portion of exports that blended American products and those coming from overseas, he said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said that sounded exactly the opposite of what <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> had told lawmakers at a June hearing and he instructed the administrator to produce any documents showing that such has been the policy. After finding that the department's counsel was not present, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> promised to provide the panel with whatever paperwork existed. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> then called on witnesses from the inspector general's office and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who had testified earlier and were still among the spectators They said they had turned up no documents showing that the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had ever maintained a policy of providing the guarantees for the American portion of blended exports. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials said their investigation indicated guarantees were provided only for exports that were 100 percent American. They said they were told that the only exception was for a type of baby food that contained a small amount of oil not produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> told the panel that the baby food example indicated that `` the possibility existed'' that blended exports could receive credit guarantees. That phase of the dispute is pertinent because the service issued a new policy last month under which it will guarantee credit for the U.S.-produced portion of a shipment that is at least 75 percent American. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said that was actually stricter than the old policy. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelowitz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> senior associate director, told the subcommittee that the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` took a hands-off management approach because it viewed the programs as commercial programs that are the responsibility of the private sector.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said that was not the view of the agency and demanded to know the name of service employee who had given that information to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> staffers. `` I will guarantee you that he will be reprimanded,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> told the administrator to forget about getting the names. `` I do n't think you need to berate them for doing their jobs as we paid them to do,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to rally voters around his embattled running mate Thursday, saying <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been `` unfairly pounded'' by his opponents but proved himself in his debate with Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. After barely mentioning <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during two earlier stops in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought up the debate during an evening rally before several thousand people _ even after his campaign strategists had spent the day playing down the debate's importance. Polls show that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been a drag on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential ticket, with many voters concerned about his qualifications. Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently belittles <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications, and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stunned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in Wednesday night's debate by telling the boyish-looking senator, `` you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'' _ a political hero with whom the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate had just compared himself Taking up <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s case, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` He did an outstanding job -LRB- in the debate -RRB- and he has been unfairly pounded by my opponents. And last night, last night, the country saw what I have seen all along _ a young knowledgeable experienced American and I am proud to have put my trust in a whole generation of young people.'' The crowd roared approval. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent most of the day campaigining in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, first in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and later in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. It was a day when the theme was supposed to focus on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a `` common sense'' attack against crime with emphasis on busting street gangs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke before the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of law enforcement officials and citizens involved in anti-crime efforts. Afterward, he flew to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> to make an energy address in the community where he broke into the oil business in the 1950s. In <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made only a brief reference to the debate, telling an airport rally, `` I think <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did an outstanding job.'' he did not mention <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in his speech earlier in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his strategists struck an upbeat note about the debate, polls by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS indicated that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was the clear winner. Arguing that the debate will have very little impact on the outcome of the presidential race, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said `` an event like that has very little to do with the election.'' `` This race is going to quickly get back to the two candidates for president,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while warming up for a morning jog at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, brushed aside a question about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s tart response when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was as experienced as <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> when he sought the presidency. `` I'm not going to tell you what I think about that because I'm out here to have some fun,'' he said But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters at the <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> rally made the most of the exchange. Campaign signs distributed to children to hold said: `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s no JFK. Thank God.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recently become more specific on issues, perhaps stung by Democrats' barbs that he has been running a campaign of slogans and no substance. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, he assailed the prison furlough program in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying: `` 1,905 times he gave free, unsupervised weekend passes to first-degree murderers, many sentenced to life without parole. Fifty-nine criminals convicted of violent crimes never came back from the governor's generous vacation program.'' Trying for an evening news sound-bite, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried a twist on tough-guy actor <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s warning to criminals: `` Go ahead, make my day.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has also made frequent use of that line. `` My opponent's answer is slightly different,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` His motto is: ` Go ahead, have a nice weekend.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` common sense'' anti crime program contained a variety of proposals, old and new, including use of the death penalty, doubling the federal prison budget to build new facilities with an additional $ 250 million each year, and converting unneeded military bases into state and federal prisons. Money seized from drug dealers and racketeers should be earmakred to help pay for more prison space, he said. He proposed creation of an anti-gang unit within the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division to coordinate resources of federal, state and local agencies He called for new mandatory sentences for gang activity involving interstate drug and weapons trafficking and racketeering. A fact sheet distributed with his speech said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would urge states to permit the prosecution as an adult anyone 15 years old and up who is charged with murder, rape, armed robbery, armed burglary, felony assault or drug trafficking. As part of the war against gangs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We should make sure that no one makes bail, is given probation, gets out on parole or stays out on parole unless they can pass a drug test.'' In <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had experienced `` a battlefield conversion'' on energy policy in his pursuit of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had changed his mind after once advocating a windfall profits tax on oil companies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in 1976, had said the nation must press for re-regulation of natural gas. `` These days he talks mushily of ` the question of deregulating natural gas,' of a ` delicate balancing of interests,' of protecting ` both consumers and producers,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 The day after an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> draft report sharply criticized <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> management, the nuclear facility suffered an equipment failure that led to a release of radioactive tritium gas. The escape of less than .01 millirems of the gas into the atmosphere Thursday morning posed no threat to health, said plant spokeswoman <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>. Workers at the plant, the nation's only producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were not evacuated, and the mayor said, `` The town's not upset at all.'' `` The tritium ... was released into the atmosphere from the facility's stack,'' a statement issued by the plant's management said. `` The accidental release occurred as the result of equipment failure during routine operations inside the Tritium Facility.'' A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest X-ray totals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft. The draft report criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and its prime contractor at the plant, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, for poor staff training, poor communications and sloppy operating procedures that have undermined safety. The 50-page report made a host of recommendations, including stepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they become serious. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, four senators Thursday asked an independent committee to review safety and operations at the plant in the wake of disclosures that as many as 30 major mishaps over 30 years had not been reported to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters or made public. Sens. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., called for an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, which was established by Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported that a study by a consulting firm of the plant's operations from 1971-1987 showed that chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures caused nuclear reactors to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a year for nearly two decades. That rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief safety operator, told the newspaper that civilian reactors with the same number of forced shutdowns would have had their operating licenses revoked. At the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, a dozen people held a two-hour vigil Thursday morning. `` These types of mishaps are serious. It's scary to hear that they've had fuel melts,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> of the environmental action group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just poor, poor management. They're managing not only our lives, but our tax dollars. In contrast, the longtime mayor of <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON> said, `` I'm not at all concerned about the townspeople's safety'' because of the plant. `` It's been there for 30 years and nobody's died yet,'' said <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, 80. `` The community does n't seem to be upset about it at all, at least to my knowledge,'' agreed City Manager <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Windham </PERSON>. `` The people at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>, they're our neighbors. We go to school with them. We go to church with them,'' said <PERSON> Windham </PERSON>. `` I have faith they would n't have done something that would endanger their own families. `` Even after reading about the things that have happened, I still have trust in <LOCATION> DOE </LOCATION>, that they're going to look after the best interests of everyone concerned,'' said <PERSON> Windham </PERSON>, who has been city manager for 25 years. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who owns a beauty and barber shop on the town's tidy, two-block shopping plaza, said: `` Everybody's nonchalant who comes in the shop They're more concerned about jobs than danger. `` But I'm concerned. I want to know if there's any danger to the environment, what kind of danger there'd be to our health,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> draft report was written by a nine-member committee of senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of companies that operate the department's nuclear weapons facilities, including <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said company officials had not yet seen the report, but already moved to correct some of the deficiencies it cited. `` Some of these problems have been identified,'' spokesman <PERSON> Clif </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` We have been thinking about making these changes for some time.'' While acknowledging there have been some changes, the Hamric Report, report, named for committee Chairman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamric </PERSON>, said that serious problems exist at virtually every level of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s management and reactor staff The authors concluded that reactor operators are not adequately trained to detect evolving problems and that operators' `` perception of their safety role is too limited ... Reactor personnel lack the in-depth technical background and training necessary to manage -LRB- abnormal -RRB- situations.'' They recommended that communications be streamlined at all levels, training of reactor operators be improved and oversight be strengthened. The panel was created in response to a request from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaspar </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> manager at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, after an aborted attempt to restart the P-Reactor this August. That reactor and the facility's other two reactors remain shut down.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> proclaimed a state of emergency and imposed a curfew Thursday to quell rioters devastating the capital for a third straight day in a revolt against high prices and unemployment. The military command, in a late-night statement, said rioters damaging public property would be fired on. President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, in the first serious crisis of his 10-year rule, put all administrative and security authorities under military command Thursday morning. It was the first time soldiers were in charge of public order since French rule ended 26 years ago. Submachine gun fire could be heard repeatedly in the center of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Thursday afternoon and evening. The French news agency, Agence France-Presse, reported at least two people dead. The military command issued a midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew Thursday night for <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and its suburbs as sporadic demonstrations and street fires continued. The command said those ignoring the curfew risked arrest. The command said public property would be protected `` by force, including the use of arms, after warning shots.'' Unconfirmed reports said injured people were hospitalized but hospital personnel would not answer questions. Many arrests were reported but authorities gave no figures. Damage has been estimated informally at several hundred million dollars but no official figures are available. Large sections of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> were scenes of devastation with government buildings burned, cars and buses overturned and windows broken. Smoke from tear gas hung in the air. Inflation has totaled more than 20 percent a year on some items, particularly food other than bread, which is subsidized. Unofficial estimates put unemployment in the cities above 40 percent and there is no unemployment compensation. A government economic reform program has caused dramatic increases in the prices of some staples. A pound of beef sells for about $ 11.40 or more, and in some places drinking water is sold for about $ 4 a gallon. Other parts of the country appeared calm Thursday. State-run television interrupted regular programs with this appeal: `` All the inhabitants of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and its surroundings are asked to return to their homes immediately and to remain calm to allow the normal course of life to be restored. Every citizen must contribute to this.'' It appealed to families to help calm the situation and asked the entire population to help the military restore order. The <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> military command established under the emergency issued a `` Communique No. 1'' declaring the army would ensure respect for law. It banned demonstrations or gatherings and said looters would be arrested and tried. `` Young people manipulated by the enemies of the Algerian people and its revolution have sacked public buildings, looted public and private property, violated private homes and harmed the very symbols of the national patrimony,'' the communique said. Public buildings were set afire by young rioters in several districts of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Several government buildings, including the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and a state-owned supermarket in the <LOCATION> Ruisseau </LOCATION> district, were consumed by flames. Heavy black smoke hung over the city. Papers from official files littered the street outside the Education Ministry. Soldiers and tanks surrounded the Bachjarrah housing complex in eastern <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, where several hundred demonstrators built burning barricades of cars, furniture and tires. As on previous days, the revolt did not have a single objective. It began last week with strikes at industrial plants, postal and communications facilities and the national airline Air Algerie. School children and university students went into the streets Tuesday and riots began when organized gangs of Islamic fundamentalists armed with iron bars joined the crowds, trying to turn the protests in their favor.

 A federal judge on Thursday denied a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request to force the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to accept more convicts into its crowded prisons, and ordered the federal government to temporarily house newly sentenced <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> inmates. The city closed its overcrowded penal system to new prisoners Tuesday when a court order limiting the city jail's population took effect. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday asked for a temporary restraining order to delay imposition of the inmate cap, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> refused the request. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s ruling requires the government to provide temporary housing for the approximately 20 inmates who enter the city's penal system daily. He scheduled a hearing for Oct. 17 on the larger question of whether the D.C. Code makes the federal governmen responsible for the district's prisoners. Prisoners sentenced since Tuesday's shutdown have been housed in places ranging from a cellblock basement to traffic division holding cells. Police department station houses were told to be ready to accept prisoners Thursday. The judge expressed concern about the welfare of the inmates, saying the city `` has apparently made these prisoners hostage to its crisis situation.'' `` We will not continue this for the duration, `` said also writes a nationally syndicated political column called `` Inside Report,'' and two newsletters.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge agreed Thursday to allow the chief plaintiff and three others to drop out of a lawsuit seeking $ 1.5 million in damages against the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also ordered that the verdict returned Wednesday remain sealed while he canvassed the other 53 plaintiffs. They have until Oct. 25 to reach their decision. The unusual turn of events began Wednesday while the jury was still out, triggered by an announcement by Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> that he wished to drop the complaint. The suit charged the defendants conspired to disrupt a `` brotherhood march'' and violate the marchers' civil rights in <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Jan. 17, 1987. In a rambling explanation to the court, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a longtime civil rights activist, said he had been losing sleep worrying about the blue-collar defendants `` who have nothing but their homes, their cars and their paychecks. ... I could not disrupt their families.'' State Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who joined the lawsuit in July, objected to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' decision to withdraw, and that resulted in a hectic day of legal maneuvering while jurors continued deliberating. The suit seeks $ 500,000 each in damages against the Invisible Empire Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> and the Southern White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION>; $ 200,000 against <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION>; and $ 100,000 each against <ORGANIZATION> Invisible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, an associate of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. Participants in the 1987 march were pelted with rocks, bottles and other debris thrown by people among a large group of counterdemonstrators who gathered in the virtually all-white county north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A week later, more than 20,000 people descended upon <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in a huge civil rights march that drew worldwide attention. During the hearing Thursday, <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> rejected a bid by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to have <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> dismissed from the suit, but agreed to allow <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and plaintiffs <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Omilama </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terrie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to drop out. The judge and both sides agreed that if punitive damages were awarded, the amount would be reduced to reflect the number of plaintiffs remaining in the suit.

 A millionaire businessman and foundation president has been charged with sodomizing five <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> boys after pretending to take an interest in their welfare, prosecutors said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 51, used his money to ingratiate himself with the boys' families, District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said Thursday. Hunt bought food, paid some of their families' bills and took the boys _ aged 6 to 9 _ to parks and zoos. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was arrested Aug. 10 and charged with fondling a 6-year-old boy he had lured into his car on a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> street, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. He said a neighbor had called police after she saw <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> invite the boy into his auto. Police searched the car and found a small black Scottie dog, toys, an instant camera and film. The indictment accused Hunt of using children in sexual performances after police searched his car, home and office and found four sexually explicit photographs of naked young boys. The 33-count indictment voted Wednesday charged <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> with 11 counts of sodomy, 13 counts of sexual abuse and nine counts of endangering the welfare of a child. The top count, sodomy, is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON> set <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s bail at $ 25,000 and scheduled a hearing for Oct. 19. The boys Hunt is charged with sodomizing are being tested for sexually transmitted diseases, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said none of the parents of the boys knew what <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was up to. He said they thought the defendant was a generous man offering their children a glimpse of life they would not ordinarily see. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s family put him in an undisclosed <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> psychiatric hospital after his arrest because he said he was going to kill himself, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. The district attorney said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> might have been involved with many more children. `` We realized very early on that there was probably more to this case than a single isolated instance of pedophile activity,'' he said. He asked that anyone with information about such activity call his office. Hunt, an investment banker, is president of <ORGANIZATION> Own </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a firm that offered counseling to children and teens, and president of the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said.

 Recruits who collapsed in the first week of physical training at the state police academy were unfit for the demanding work, said a lawyer representing the state troopers who led the class. `` At least half of those tested did not meet state police requirements,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. At least 16 recruits from the class of 50 were hospitalized with dehydration and exhaustion by the end of the first week of instruction. One is just coming out of a coma. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said he represents the two troopers who ran the academy's physical training program because they are union members He said no formal complaints have been filed against them, but `` I represent members in any type of situation, including allegations of misconduct.'' State probes of the academy's training by the governor's office, the state attorney general and the speaker of the house have begun in the wake of the reports of illness by cadets. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said he studied physical fitness test scores of <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> academy recruits who entered the 14-week class beginning Sept. 19. The cadets were from municipal police forces throughout western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, required by state law to attend the academy for training. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> acknowledged that state police requirements are more stringent than those for municipal forces. He declined to specify the state police physical requirements. `` I ca n't give you that in 25 words or less,'' he said. He said the cadets' test results were released to him by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the academy, in response to a freedom of information request. A spokeswoman at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> said municipal police cadets undergo the same pre-entrance tests as state police cadets, but the tests are entrance requirements only for state police cadets. Municipal cadets must pass only a doctor's examination and a body fat test to be admitted to the police academy. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopans </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had been considering changing its fitness requirements when several members of the Agawam class fell ill. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, who collapsed the first day of class at the academy, emerged from his coma Thursday and listened to the American League baseball championship series on the radio, his family said Thursday

<HEAD>Infant Dies in Hospital Flash Fire During Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An operating room flash fire fatally burned a 15-day-old premature baby undergoing emergency heart surgery Thursday, a hospital spokesman said. The 2-pound infant suffered second-degree burns over 60 percent of his body in the 8 a.m. fire. He died two hours later, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` The baby was already in congestive heart failure and the burns combined to cause death,'' Wise said. Wise said the cause of the flash fire was n't known. `` Our technicians are looking at everything. The equipment was all working properly. It is very curious. We just do n't know,'' said Wise. None of the operating room surgeons or personnel was injured. Oxygen was being used during the procedure, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said, but added, `` There was nothing unique about this. No one has ever heard of this occurring.'' The infant, born 16 weeks premature, was suffering heart failure when the emergency procedure in the hospital's neonatal unit was started by a team of three surgeons, a neonatalologist, a nurse and an anesthesiologist. `` There were flames and the baby was lifted immediately up and taken to the intensive care unit. The baby was immediately put on life support, but died two hours later,'' said Wise. It was n't known if the parents were in the hospital at the time, said Wise, who did n't release the identity of the family or the name of the infant. `` The staff and nurses up there are devastated by this,'' Wise said. The surgery was meant to correct a congenital heart defect known as patent ductus arteriosus. The defect occurs when a small duct between the aorta, the artery leaving the left side of the heart, and the pulmonary artery, which leaves the right side of the heart, fails to close as it should soon after birth. As a result, blood from both sides is pumped into the pulmonary artery and from there into the lungs. `` Normally, medication is used, but 20 percent do n't respond,'' Wise said. `` They went in surgically to try to correct it. We've done this about 50 times earlier and there were no problems Nothing like this ever happened.'' Firefighters responded to an automatic alarmed triggered by activation of the sprinkler system, but the fire was out by the time they arrived, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, spokesman for the Fire Department. <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and other exclusive communities, is sometimes known as the `` hospital to the stars'' because of the many celebrities who are treated there.

The grand jury said it found no evidence of sexual assault and said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> herself was responsible for the degraded condition in which she was found after a four-day disappearance last November. The investigation received no cooperation from Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> or her family, who with their advisers _ the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and attorneys <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> _ had accused authorities of a racially motivated cover-up. `` They have charged the atmosphere with incredible, incendiary remarks and with extraordinary tension,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said during a news conference. He asked the state judicial discipline committee to punish the lawyers. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who appointed <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> special prosecutor, was asked later about <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>. He replied: `` Is there anyone left in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who believes them?'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found Nov. 28, seemingly dazed, outside an apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Her body was smeared with feces and scrawled with racial slurs. She claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by several white men, and she implicated law enforcement officials in the attack. The grand jury provided no reason for Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> to lie but noted that she had been punished and beaten on previous occasions by her mother and her mother's boyfriend, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, for leaving home and staying out late. The report cleared Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a policeman who committed suicide shortly after Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found. Both were accused by her advisers of taking part in the alleged attack. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> charged the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> lawyers lied repeatedly about the case, urged their clients to break the law and `` made every effort to prevent the criminal justice system from uncovering the truth of what happened to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' The attorney general accused the advisers of `` opportunism and hucksterism in presenting their personal agenda'' and added: `` Perhaps the greatest disservice done by the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers is the reckless manner in which they jeopardized the rights of future victims of racial assaults.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers bitterly attacked the report. `` What should we expect from 21 whites from <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> asked on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION>, referring to 21 whites on the panel of 23. `` It is clear they never intended to arrest and prosecute those people who did this to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is `` not after people who rape black girls. ... They want to stop anybody who will stand up for the rights of black people in this country.'' `` It ai n't over till she -LRB- Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> -RRB- sings,'' he said. `` You do n't know her story.'' No charges were filed against Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. `` First of all, it's got to be recognized and reasserted that we're dealing with a young girl,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. `` But I think she also must realize the kind of turmoil she set in place as a result of her false allegations. `` I think she needs help and should get as much help as possible so her life can be salvaged.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, faces a 30-day jail term for contempt after refusing to answer a grand jury subpoena at the advisers' urging, but has so far escaped arrest, at one point seeking sanctuary in a church. Her daughter also defied a subpoena but was not cited for contempt. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> left her new home in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Thursday without comment. Thursday night, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> led about 200 people in a demonstration outside the offices of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which reported details of the grand jury's report last week. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said events showed the newspaper had illegal access to the grand jury's findings. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said he and Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would be in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Saturday to `` give our complete and official reaction.'' The grand jury heard more than 180 witnesses. The probe cost taxpayers at least $ 620,000, and the case was investigated `` perhaps in a more thorough way than any other case in the history of the state,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The report examined Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s behavior down to a microscopic level, including analyses of dog hairs found in feces, burn marks on Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s jeans, and carpet fibers found in her former apartment. The report concluded Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> spent much of her time during the four days at the apartment. The report said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> apparently burned a hole in her pants, scrawled `` nigger'' on her shoe, smeared dog feces on her body and clothing, and stepped into a plastic garbage bag in front of the apartment. The grand jury issued recommendations to the Legislature for legal reforms, including a proposal that would allow the relative of a dead person to bring a defamation case when the individual is falsely accused of a felony. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and the grand jury also recommended enactment of an obstruction of justice law. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has a law against obstruction of governmental administration, but it can not be used against <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> because it applies only when a threat of violence or a separate criminal act is employed, the attorney general said. He also called for changes in a state law that prevented him from moving against those who helped protect Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> from arrest for contempt. Under state law, people can be charged with harboring a fugitive only if the offense for which the fugitive is wanted is a felony, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The contempt charge was not a felony.

 Soviet television on Thursday celebrated the defeat of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s right-wing President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, saying voters' rejection of his bid to rule until 1997 proved `` power can be seized by bayonets, but they can not keep it. Since 1973, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` played the role of the firm but just ` father of the nation,' trying to make Chileans forget the bloody history of his ascension to the throne, his betrayal of the Constitution, the murder of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION>,'' Soviet political observer <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fesynenko </PERSON> said on the TV. But <PERSON> Fesynenko </PERSON> noted that: `` First of all, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will be in power until March 1990, and only in December 1989 will presidential elections be held in the country, if the dictatorship does not abolish them first.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the people of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> `` have spoke eloquently, convincingly and courageously After 15 years of military rule, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has said ` No' to dictatorship and ` Yes' to democracy. `` We congratulate the people of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> for having given the world such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. The West German government called on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military leaders to abide by terms for the nation's democratization. `` We hope that the government will now hold to its own promised timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free elections,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON>, a foreign affairs spokesman for the British opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of 500 foreigners who visited <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to view the balloting, said, `` It's a tremendous triumph for democracy in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, a totally unique situation where a dictator has been voted out in a plebiscite.'' <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON> added, `` It is absolutely crucial now to ensure that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> fully accepts the decision of the Chilean people.'' Some Latin leaders reacted with restrained pleasure. InArgentina, President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said, `` The people of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> have expressed their inalienable right to decide their own future. The results of plebiscite open the way toward the restoration of democracy.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Abreu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodre </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> said, `` Defeating a dictatorship is not easy, but when a government stays a long time in office it becomes a heavy burden to the people.''

The Mexican government, which broke relations with <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> after the 1973 coup, gave asylum to many Chileans, including <PERSON> Hortensia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussi </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s widow. <PERSON> Bussi </PERSON> recently returned to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> after the military government allowed exiles to return.

In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, legislators rose to their feet in Parliament to applaud the news of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat. The government immediately named a new ambassador to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, a post long vacant in a sign of protest. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We hope that the plebiscite result, which appears to reflect the will of the Chilean people, will represent an important first step on the path back toward full democracy.''

<TEXT>
 The owner of a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> resort who conducted two parties marking the birth date of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> apologized for his actions Thursday, saying the events were `` not only stupid, but insensitive.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> told a news conference that the parties and reports of a room full of Nazi memorabilia at his Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino had resulted in a `` living nightmare'' for his family, friends and employees. `` Let me say once again, for everyone to hear, I despise <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and everything he stood for,'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I ca n't tell you how much I regret my insensitivity on this point. `` It was innocent, but it was very, very bad judgment and it was in very bad taste. I now realize that and I deeply regret it and apologize for it.'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> read a seven-page statement, then left without answering questions. Reporters were then allowed to go in the room where the memorabilia was stored. Included were 20 World War II-era vehicles, including German staff cars, and murals picturing <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> with his staff, at the opening of the autobahn, and German soldiers marching through the streets of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> has one of the largest antique auto collections in the world, which has been open to the public for years. The room of Nazi memorabilia is adjacent to the antique cars, but has not been opened to the public. The resort owner said he was preparing to open new exhibits, including one featuring cars of former presidents, one on Rolls Royces made in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and one focusing on the Axis powers during the World War II era. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> has been under fire for two weeks following reports of the Nazi memorabilia room and the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday parties. The hotel owner said the reports were leaked by people who were out to get him. <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumbolz </PERSON> declined Thursday to comment on <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s admission that the parties were conducted. Gaming agents have visited the resort at least twice to check on the displays. In one visit they found a printing plate for a bumper stick which read `` Hitler Was Right.'' <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> said Thursday that someone else ordered the bumper sticker printed, and he ordered the stickers destroyed when he learned about their existence. He declined to identify the person, saying `` enough people have been pilloried by this whole mess.''

 Air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will manage the flow of planes into <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a move to help local controllers and clear congested skies, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> announced the change one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reduced the number of departures and arrivals at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. This year, controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> have made 30 errors, more than twice the mistakes recorded in 1987. Four were made since last Friday. Under the plan announced late Thursday, controllers at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will monitor air traffic at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> to enforce the limit of 155 departures and landings during daily peak hours `` It may be that they delay an airplane taking off at another facility. It may be that they slow an airplane down,'' said transportation Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>. `` I do n't see it as a reprimand,'' she said. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is an anomaly. We feel this is an appropriate action.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> controllers, Ms. <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said, will still be responsible for directing planes to runways once they enter O'Hare's air space. `` We're not managing the traffic in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' she added. `` We're not managing approaches and departures from -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB-. We just want to make sure that the amount of traffic stays within the limits.'' During peak periods _ between 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. _ the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land in good weather now has been reduced to 155 per hour from 180 at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. The plan also affects some planes at Midway Airport on the southwest side because the airports share air space. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said his department will study whether those limits are effective. `` I have ordered these actions because today's operating environment in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area may require new traffic management procedures in order to assure continued safety,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. Controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, the nation's busiest airport, made two errors Friday, one Sunday and one Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. O'Hare controllers' 30 errors this year compared to 12 in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has said. In comparison, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second busiest, has had just six errors this year, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National Airport just two, officials said. The latest incident at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> came just two months after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issued a report saying that chronic understaffing of controllers, mandatory overtime, outdated equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, the wayward humpback whale who wandered up the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> three years ago, was spotted Thursday feeding closer to shore than other migrating leviathans. `` We do n't think he's lost or sick, he could just be feeding on near shore fish,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Calambokidis </PERSON>, a research biologist for <ORGANIZATION> Cascadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collective </ORGANIZATION>, which spotted the whale Saturday morning at <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>'s Bay. Fishermen also reported seeing what they believed to be the 40-foot humpback whale on Sunday and Tuesday. Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said their spotting was about 2.5 miles off <LOCATION> Bodega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>, `` just lazying around.'' Cascadia's sighting marks the third consecutive year <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has been sighted officially off the Sonoma-Marin coast since the fall of 1985, when he blundered into the tributary waters northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. For 25 days, the 45-ton whale wandered up and down the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION>, gaining national publicity, poking into narrow sloughs and endangering his life because he was out of his salt-water habitat. The scientists, part of a private nonprofit group conducting a three-year study of humpback and blue whales, say they are sure they spotted <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. They previously spotted him in 1986 and last year. Researcher <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Falxa </PERSON> said that among other things the whale was identified by multiple scarring on his dorsal fin. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> also is easily identifiable by the black and white color pattern and a lateral scar on his 15-foot fluke. The only thing unusual about <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s behavior is that he has been feeding well inshore from the other migrating whales congregating this time of the year near the <LOCATION> Farallon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> 26 miles off the mouth of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The researchers are photographing and monitoring <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> for Cascadia and the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Whale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The Cascadia researchers are studying the populations of blue and humpback whales and their migrations, and identifying individual animals like <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. `` We have found record numbers of blue whales so far and about 100 to 200 humpbacks in the area each year,'' <PERSON> Calambokidis </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> failed to find his way to freedom in 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels eventually got the whale headed in the right direction and he cruised back into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, cheered by hundreds of people.

<TEXT>
 A stern Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told the nation Thursday he will stay president until his term runs out in 1990, as police fired water cannons and tear gas into crowds celebrating his defeat in a referendum on extending his rule to 1997. `` Every man and woman of this country can be absolutely sure we will carry out completely the itinerary foreseen in the constitution,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said in a speech broadcast nationwide on radio and television. It was his first public declaration since a resounding loss in Wednesday's referendum. `` I recognize and accept the majority verdict expressed yesterday by the citizenry,'' he declared. The authoritarian leader appeared in a white military dress uniform. Unsmiling and head slightly bowed toward a set of microphones, he spoke in a strong, steady voice. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> also warned opposition leaders not to misinterpret the vote as a mandate for them, or a rejection of an 8-year-old constitution that called for the referendum. The referendum also provides for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> if defeated _ as he was _ to remain in office until March 1990, when the winner of an open election planned for late 1989 will assume power. `` No one can feel they have the mandate of the people to twist what the people decided,'' he said. The constitution, crafted by his administration, was passed in a loosely organized 1980 referendum that opposition leaders said was rife with vote fraud. Thousands of jubilant foes of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> chanted `` He has fallen!'' and marched in confetti-strewn streets to celebrate their ballot-box victory over the military ruler. `` An authoritarian system has been overthrown,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a leader of a 16-party coalition that campaigned for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in a yes-or-no plebiscite. Some marches turned violent. While tens of thousands of Chileans demonstrated peacefully at a nearby park and plaza, hundreds of youths near the government palace hurled bottles and sticks at police, and dragged wood planks and other debris onto downtown streets. Riot police used water cannons, setting off mad scrambles engulfing passersby walking along nearby streets. Tear gas fumes made many people cover their faces with handkerchiefs and office workers closed windows 10 stories above ground. More than 20 people were arrested and two policemen were injured, authorities said. Reports also said dozens of people hurt, struck by police nightsticks or by tear gas canisters. A crowd of many thousands, mostly young men, packed all eight lanes of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s main boulevard for blocks in a standoff with riot police. With nightfall, hundreds of demonstrators lit torches made from rolled-up newspapers. The tightly packed crowd pressed against a cordon of police officers who each held out fiberglass shields. Eventually, the crowd broke through the cordon and was immediately dispersed by riot police. Several people were trampled as the crowd fled and were seen lying on the ground or doubled over in pain. No one appeared badly hurt, however. At 8:50 p.m. -LRB- 7:50 p.m. EDT -RRB-, a blackout hit downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, but power returned to the city in 15 minutes. The cause of the blackout was not known immediately. Authorities allowed union leader <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON> to address the demonstrators and to urge them to remain calm. `` We have to be careful of the women and children who are here,'' <PERSON> Troncoso </PERSON> said. The demonstrators yelled insults at police, calling them `` murderers.'' Wednesday's rejection of the army commander, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, cleared the way for elections to return <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to democracy. The opposition urged elections be held before December 1989, a plan that has been rejected by the still-powerful military. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s last presidential election was in 1970, when the president overthrown by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist, was elected. Observers expect at least two opposition candidates will run in the presidential elections: <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, Socialist leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will rule until the new elections. If the military leaves power, it will further signal an end to the military governments that have dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Elected civilian rule has replaced the military in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> in the past decade. The nearest military ruler to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who has ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since seizing power in 1954. After the government conceded defeat early Thursday, all 16 Cabinet members handed in their resignations to allow <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to appoint new ministers if he wanted. The Cabinet was formed in July 1987 in part to supervise his campaign. With 99.6 percent of votes counted, `` no'' votes against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s continued rule totaled 3,945,865, or 54.7 percent, while `` yes'' votes totaled 3,106,099, or 43 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. Voided ballots totaled 164,427. The turnout was more than 7.2 million of the 7.4 million registered voters. By midmorning, small groups of students had gathered in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s streets and enthusiastically chanted anti-Pinochet slogans. Initial police attempts to disperse the youngsters angered bystanders and only attracted more participants. By noon, thousands of demonstrators had spilled onto the city's main eight-lane boulevard, jamming traffic as they shouted, `` Go away, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>!'' and `` He has fallen!'' Drivers beeped their horns with the chants. Other demonstrators marched through the streets waving <LOCATION> Chilean </LOCATION> flags and opposition party banners. Confetti and streamers floated down from windows of downtown office buildings. In the business district, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s loss prompted a 16 percent average decline in stock values. The opposition said it would negotiate with the military to move up the date of the presidential election. They also want to strike provisions from the constitution that leave congress virtually powerless to amend it and give the armed forces both autonomy and a supervisory policy-making role. `` It is indispensible now to elect, within a short period of time, a president and congress with powers to modify the constitution,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said.

Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., announced at a caucus hearing that the code, to be issued in a few weeks, will aim to correct what he called Japanese `` economic arrogance'' and insensitivity toward <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> He said the code would be along the lines of the former <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Principles </PERSON>, a code of conduct intended to help the black majority in white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> through training and enlightened labor standards to which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were asked to adhere. The code was named for the Rev. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> civil rights leader who later announced he has decided to press for total disengagement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The forthcoming code would be aimed at Japanese corporations and their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiaries, said <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>. It would seek an end to racial stereotypes and caricatures offensive to blacks, such as the `` Black Sambo'' dolls exported by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the hiring of more blacks as executives in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories and distributorships of Japanese concerns. The efforts at persuasion would be backed by a `` Buy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' campaign during the Christmas shopping season to demonstrate the purchasing power of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> blacks who, in the 1980 census, numbered more than 26 million, he said. The Black Caucus approach was described as too weak by some speakers at the hearing and unrealistic by others. The Afrikan-American Committee Against Japanese Racism, a Washington-based militant activist group, announced plans to smash Japanese consumer products in a demonstration outside the Japanese Embassy next Monday. The `` slap on the wrist that the Japanese received in the form of a verbal protest from a handful of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not enough,'' said <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>, chairman of the committee, which describes itself as a coalition of black militant organizations. `` African-Americans will not buy any more products manufactured in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, from trinkets to transistors, from toasters to Toyotas,'' said <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>, who also advocated an end to Japanese investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Adonis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a black attorney who once worked as a registered lobbyist for the Japanese and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> governments, criticized boycotts as `` the civil rights approach'' to the problem and said it would not succeed with the Japanese and could isolate black business interests. `` Moral pressure and outrage by African-Americans will not motivate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to share the wealth,'' said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who now represents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black firms in international trade matters. `` There must be a minimal quid pro quo to motivate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to buy into black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s business objectives,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said, adding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` black business, as a whole, has yet to establish a track record or demonstrate the wherewithal to seriously penetrate international markets or attract foreign capital ...'' Two Japanese concerns _ <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ testified on their efforts to recognize aspirations of the black community and promote its interests. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has nine Hispanic or black <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> dealerships in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plus an active recruiting program to find more minority distributors, while financing live telecasts of <PERSON> black </PERSON> college football games, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, head of a public relations firm representing Toyota Motor Sales. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it has shown social responsibility that `` compares well with that of American-owned companies that have been sensitized to minority issues over the past three decades.'' Both companies said they contribute regularly to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and similar educational programs.

 A newly released hostage is providing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debriefing team with `` a lot of raw information'' that could be helpful in learning about Americans still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is close to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team that is interrogating Indian professor <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said he and three Americans held with him _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 41, a native of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ were moved frequently by their abductors to thwart efforts to locate them, the source disclosed. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian citizen and a resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was flown to <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> Wednesday for medical checks at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military hospital. He told medical officials he plans to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The educator was released on Monday after 20 months of captivity, but his three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> colleagues are still held. According to the source, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has `` given no indications he was abused'' while a captive and his comments indicated that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> `` are not in a life-threatening situation.'' The source said he could release few details about the conditions of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s captivity. Six other Americans are also missing and believed held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, as are seven other foreigners. The source said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and the three Americans `` got moved frequently.'' `` He was moved around at least half a dozen times.'' `` Wherever he was before he was released, the others would not be there now,'' said the source. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team questioned <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> for a second day Thursday. The source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has been speaking with the special team two to three times a day, for about an hour and a half in each sitting. He said the interrogators are members of a `` standard debriefing team'' used to question released hostages. Asked if they included <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials, the source said only: `` You're not out of the ballpark.'' He reiterated that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had no contact with American hostages other than <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>. All four taught at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Gunmen posing as police abducted them on Jan. 24, 1987, on the campus in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility and said it freed <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as a goodwill gesture. According to the official, the four captives apparently had little contact with the outside world. `` As far as they -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> questioners -RRB- know, he had no newspapers,'' said the official. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has not spoken with reporters since arriving in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` He's reticent to talk in public. He does n't know how those holding his friends would react,'' said the source. No sign has emerged from <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s comments that other hostages would be released soon, he added _ `` We had no indications anybody else will be released soon or at all.'' The source added: `` There are indications that they -LRB- the hostage-takers -RRB- are backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, we assume financed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Master Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was receiving medical treatment. `` Mr. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> says he feels much better today,'' <PERSON> Fick </PERSON> reported. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> medical officials said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> suffered from `` tremendous fatigue'' following his captivity.

<DATELINE>NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist Party bosses of <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> province were ousted Thursday night as a stone-throwing crowd of 30,000 people attacked their headquarters. The provincial leaders had promised to resign after a meeting with Serbian leaders earlier Thursday in the most dramatic development in three months of mass street protests over ethnic strife and an economic crisis. The development boosted a drive by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, for tighter control over its two autonomous provinces, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and ethnically troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. At least 41 people, including 14 policemen, were injured when the crowd outside the headquarters in this provincial capital of Novi Sad surged toward riot police guarding the building, hurling stones and breaking 20 windows. State-run news media said two policemen were seriously hurt and six people were hospitalized. Four people were reported arrested. The protesters, who held vigil outside the headquarters for two days, began to disperse after the leadership stepped down. Witnesses said police rebuffed an attempt by the crowds overnight Wednesday to force their way into the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> party committee voted 87-10 to dismiss the 15-member Politburo, the highest political body in the province. Two members abstained in a meeting attended by 99 of the committee's 127 members. Provincial party leader <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sogorov </PERSON> said a 10-member provisional group would be established while new leaders were chosen for <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, a flat, fertile area that produces most of the nation's grain. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the provincial leadership promised to resign after meeting with Serbian party leaders in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the nation's capital 40 miles to the south The agency quoted the Serbian party as saying: `` The <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership has been deaf to the demands of the working class and other citizens. A serious split has occurred between the <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> leadership and the people.'' Outside the party headquarters in <LOCATION> Novo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sad </LOCATION>, protesters waved <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> flags and shouted complaints about low wages and declining living standards. Strikes and worker protests have become commonplace because of 217 percent annual inflation, 15 percent unemployment and austerity plans imposed because of a $ 21 billion foreign debt. Witnesses said demonstrators sang Serbian nationalist songs and chanted `` Police Go Away!'' `` We Are Going To Smash Windows!'' `` Thieves, Thieves!'' `` We Want Freedom!'' and `` We Are With You, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON>!'' Tens of thousands of Serbs have rallied almost daily for three months in support of efforts by <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> to assert more authority in the provinces. Mass protests in Novi Sad started in response to the provincial party leadership's decision to discipline two members for supporting <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, Serbs, a largely <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> minority, claim harassment by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 2 million people and are predominantly Moslem. The southern province borders on <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Nikola </PERSON> <PERSON> Ljubicic </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s federal presidency and a former defense minister, told Serbian party leaders Thursday that `` emergency measures'' should be taken to stop the unrest but was not specific. `` I am concerned about today's rally in Novi Sad,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` Will this rally be satisfied with the decision to be taken -LRB- the resignation of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>'s leadership -RRB-? It can raise other demands. How can we control the situation?'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> rejected the proposal and said no emergency action should be taken `` since this involves a protest of workers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in campaign rhetoric and commercials on Thursday, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate appeared `` extremely insecure'' in debate. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised his running mate's performance and outlined a crime control program. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shook off a poll suggesting that Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> beat him handily in their debate Wednesday night and said the Republicans are `` still ahead'' in the race for the White House. Most pre-debate surveys gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a slight advantage over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a little over a month remaining in the campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> preferred an instant <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> pollrating him the debate winner by 51 percent to 27 percent. `` I was just delighted,'' said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. That finding was reinforced by a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll Thursday that found <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the winner by 50 to 27. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent, up from 37 percent who rated him qualified before the debate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was rated as qualified by 78 percent, up from 64 percent. In <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying: `` There are as we know, going to be major changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Do you want the man who selected <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be making those appointments?'' The highlight of the debate came as the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> compared favorably with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s record at the time of the 1960 campaign. `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> shot back. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign rushed to air two television commercials questioning <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications. One showed pictures of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, all vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency without an election, while an announcer said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pick of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as running mate marked a `` lapse of judgment.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters aboard his campaign jet en route to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> the debate was a `` real plus for us'' and called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance `` very disturbing. `` I thought he was programmed beyond belief ... extremely insecure, this fellow,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Lone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he campaigned together with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` He did n't have a sense of strength or control or anything. ... Thinking about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> being a heartbeat away from the presidency, to watch that, I think, is very, very troubling.'' Republicans from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rallied to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s cause as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> organization appeared to be practicing damage control. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides conspiculously violated their rule about publicly discussing polls. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said the vice president was ahead in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, two key swing states. He predicted the vice president would carry <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by at least six points. `` This race is going to quickly get back to the two candidates for president,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` There are two gladiators in the arena that are going to count in the end.'' In <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, campaign signs distributed to children attending a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign rally said, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s no JFK. Thank God.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered his first speech of the day on crime without mention of his running mate or the debate. Instead, he ridiculed a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program by mimicking tough-guy actor <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s popular refrain `` make my day.'' `` My opponent's answer is slightly different,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` His motto is: ` Go ahead, have a nice weekend.'' He praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance as he warmed up for a morning jog, though, and later told a rally in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, `` I think <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did an outstanding job.'' And Thursday evening in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took up <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s case again `` He did an outstanding job and he has been unfairly pounded by my opponents,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, coming to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s defense, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> resorted to a `` cheap shot ... unbecoming a senator of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' with his much-quoted debate put-down of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> disputed any suggestion of nastiness on his part. `` What happened there was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> kept comparing himself to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and he overreached himself and I got fed up with it,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator told reporters. However, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> threw his jab after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s one and only reference to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in the 90-minute debate. One Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his debate advisers had honed the remark in practice sessions. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> panel of six veteran debate judges unanimously rated <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the debate winner, 148-125. They said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got off to a good start, but failed to buttress his arguments with specifics or refute <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s charges that he voted repeatedly against the environment, programs for poor children and veterans. While the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> comment drew the most attention, one judge, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s biggest drawback was his repeated inability to explain the first steps he would take if he suddenly became president <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first stop of the day was at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he denounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and castigated `` liberal experimentation with crime.'' He said he would add $ 250 million a year to the budget for the next four years for prisons to `` incarcerate the hardened felons and rising number of drug offenders.'' Adviser <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the street gang proposal would cost about $ 50 million and would coordinate existing efforts by federal, state and local law enforcement authorities. After the speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went jogging with students at the university, and was asked about the debate. He said he felt `` as good as I did last night, which is very, very good.'' He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` answered the questions, he was knowledgeable, he did an outstanding job and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know it.'' Asked about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> comment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to tell you what I think about that because I'm out here to have some fun.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sought to turn the tables on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at a rally in <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. He said the Democrat had a chance to `` address whether he would continue the extreme liberal policies of Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he took over the presidency. ... He waffled, shuffled, ducked and dived.''

 Attorneys for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government joined forces in federal appeals court Thursday, arguing that international relations will suffer if an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman's lawsuit is upheld. `` We have been working very closely with the Soviets and we have made wonderful progress,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Letter </PERSON>. `` It's important that this progress not be set back.'' He was addressing a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which is considering the case of <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, an American denounced by the Soviets and barred from doing business in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after 14 years. One of the judges, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON>, bristled at the mention of foreign relations saying, `` Is n't that something we're supposed to ignore _ the political considerations _ in reaching our decision?'' <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> has sued the Soviets for libel. The Soviets have resisted and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sided with the Soviets, saying they may not be sued for libel in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, ridiculed the contention that the case endangers U.S.-Soviet relations. `` I personally think they have bigger people to fry than my client,'' <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> told the court. `` I've never heard that we could n't conclude an arms agreement because of <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mage </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing the Soviets, insisted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts do not have jurisdiction because incidents involving <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> did not occur in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also said the nation is immune from suit as a foreign sovereign. `` It's really two against one,'' <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet alignment in court. He has expressed bitterness over the government's abandonment of one of its own citizens in the legal proceedings. `` I look at this as a contest of politics versus justice,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>. `` There's never been a case exactly like this before.'' <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s problems began in 1984 when, after a 14-year amicable relationship, the Soviets suddenly revoked <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>'s permit to sell medical supplies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Until then, his <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had done a thriving business exporting such items as kidney dialysis machines, heart-lung machines and batteries for heart pacemakers. Soon after revoking his permit, the Soviets, through the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, printed a story denouncing <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> as a `` duplicitous negotiatior,'' accusing him of bribery and smuggling and intimating he was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, adamant about his innocence, took an unprecedented action, suing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for libel in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. He also demanded that the Soviets pay for medical equipment still in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviet defendants at first ignored the suit. But in 1985, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> entered a default judgment against them in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, awarding Gregorian total damages of $ 413,000. Of that amount, $ 250,000 was for libel. The Soviets refused to pay. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> said he would seize Soviet assets, and to dramatize his claim, he took custody of a typewriter at an <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> correspondent's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, home as partial payment. Then, Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers went to court. The Soviet agency V.O. Medexport, which did business with Gregorian, asserted its immunity from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and moved to reverse the judgment. On April 5, 1987, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> dismissed his own libel judgment, ruling that he did not have jurisdiction because of immunity considerations. However, he let stand his ruling the Soviets should meet their contractual obligation to pay for the medical supplies. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> appealed the ruling on libel to the 9th Circuit. The Soviets appealed the contractual award, as well as disputing the libel claim. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>'s argument is based on a theory that libel in connection with a commercial activity is exempt from immunities act and must be tried as a civil claim in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Popper </PERSON>, who represents the Soviets, said in his legal brief that there is no precedent for such a claim. `` Plaintiffs fail to cite a decision of any court in the entire world -LRB- including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- that has asserted jurisdiction on a claim of libel against a foreign sovereign,'' <PERSON> Popper </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s brief sided with the Soviets, saying `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend that foreign states could be sued for claims of libel.'' An additional view on the case has come from the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest law and policy center which filed a friend of the court brief for Gregorian. `` WLF believes that the outrageous nature of the lies published by defendants-appellants is such that they should be held accountable,'' the foundation's lawyers argued. A ruling for the Soviets, they said, would reduce the ability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts to protect the rights of citizens doing business overseas.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday trumpeted his running mate's performance in the vice presidential debate and characterized <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a `` weak candidate'' and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` extremely insecure'' and `` programmed beyond belief.'' The harsh attack on the Republican ticket by the Democratic presidential nominee came during a flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and at a rally in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with his sidekick, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. It continued in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a rally: `` There are as we know, going to be major changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Do you want the man who selected <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be making those appointments?'' `` My friends, strong presidents look for strong vice presidents,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told about 2,500 people gathered in this depressed steel town. `` Weak candidates look for something else.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a sparkling lake and the struggling <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant as a backdrop, was in a jubilant mood as he praised <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and asked voters to judge the presidential standardbearers on the strength of their running mates. `` When a nominee selects his running mate, he's choosing the first member of his Cabinet, the first member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the first member of his diplomatic team,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` You've got to choose somebody who's ready to step into that Oval Office at a moment's notice and who know's what he's going to do when he gets there,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a swipe at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s responses when asked repeatedly what he would do if suddenly elevated to the presidency. `` There was only one man on that stage last night who fit that bill and his name is <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> He referred to picking a running mate as a nominee's `` first presidential decision'' and asked: `` Judge us by the way we made it and who we chose Ask yourself which one of us fulfilled our presidential obligation.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose campaign was seeking to capitalize on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s performance by airing two ads attacking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications for the vice presidency, said the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> selection `` is n't the first time that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed,'' and then cited what he called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> failures in the Iran-Contra scandal, the war on drugs, trade relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and reforms in the nation's banking industry and regulatory practices `` It was very disturbing,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said while en route to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I thought he was programmed beyond belief ... extremely insecure, this fellow. He did n't have a sense of strength or control or anything. ... Thinking about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> being a heartbeat away from the presidency, to watch that, I think, is very, very troubling.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> briefly touched on his economic promises and vowed to bring work back to Lone Star, which the campaign says has lost 5,000 steel jobs in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. But he spent most of his time discussing the debate, chiding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for accepting massive foreign investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate and business. `` As Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said so wisely and well, we can not let others take over our economic destiny,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said neither of the new ads featured excerpts from the debate but that one portrayed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as the clear winner of the event and raised questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications. The second ad raises the issue of whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be `` a heartbeat away'' from the presidency. Both were to debut Thursday night, joining a host of other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads in the campaign's largest advertising foray to date. The Democratic campaign issued a four-page statement labeling many of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate responses as inaccurate or misleading. The statement challenged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate assertions that he was concerned about the environment by citing votes against the Superfund, asbestos cleanup, water pollution and rural drinking water programs. It also accused <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of misrepresenting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's record on poverty, drugs and human rights. It pointed to increases in poverty and drug trafficking in the past eight years and the administration's failure to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its apartheid system of racial segregation.

<HEAD>Soviets To Produce More Wine, Beer, Cognac In 1989</HEAD>

 In a major change for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-drinking campaign, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is planning to increase production of beer, wine, cognac and champagne by up to 38 percent to meet popular demand, a newspaper reported Thursday. However, the Trud labor daily said the government crusade has gone so far it will be difficult to significantly increase alcohol production soon. The drive was launched two months after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in March 1985. `` We have to restore a significant part of production, and that's complicated,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Konobov </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s food division, told the newspaper. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985 ordered a reduction in the production of vodka and other alcoholic beverages, an increase in their price, an increase in the minimum drinking age to 21 and cuts in the hours and numbers of stores that could sell alcohol. He has since cited the campaign as a major reason in the increased life expectancy for Soviet men. But the anti-drinking drive has provoked nationwide grumbling, and even indignation, because Soviets now must stand in long lines just to buy an occassional bottle of wine or beer. Cuts in government alcohol production also have proved a bonanza for the country's moonshiners. Sugar now must be rationed in many cities because of shortages caused by the thousands of Soviets who use it to produce `` samogon,'' or home brew. <PERSON> Konobov </PERSON> said the goal set by the 1985 anti-drinking drive was `` noble,'' but that it has been pursued by bureaucratic means. `` So it is obvious that corrections are necessary,'' he said. According to Trud, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has proposed for next year to increase wine production by 38 percent, to 675 million gallons; beer, by 12 percent, to 1.8 billion gallons; cognac, by 28 percent, to 33.2 million gallons, and champagne, by 9 percent, to 58 million gallons. The newspaper said vodka and other strong drinks would continue to be manufactured in quantities laid down by a government decree in 1985. Plans also call for more spirits to be imported from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, one of the world's biggest rum producers, and from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and other countries, <PERSON> Konobov </PERSON> said. According to figures released by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, there are more than 4.5 million officially registered alcoholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the total number is believed to be much more. As one of the new methods being tried to discourage alcohol abuse, Soviet television on Tuesday night broadcast a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television movie titled `` Life of the Party,'' starring <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, which told the true-life story of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman who joined Alcoholics Anonymous to beat the bottle.

<HEAD>Opposition Says New Law Gives Ortega Dictatorial Powers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders said Thursday a new emergency law gives President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> dictatorial powers and is likely to be applied soon. The law, approved Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, gives the president authority to declare a state of emergency and restrict civil rights for reasons of war, economic crisis or national disaster. It took effect immediately. U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, have been fighting to overthrow the leftist government since 1981 and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is in an economic crisis. The opposition in the 96-seat assembly said in a statement that the law bestows on <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> `` too great a concentration of extraordinary powers,'' making him an `` absolute dictator.'' <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The new law consolidates the dictatorial and totalitarian state, and just as in the <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> of -LRB- President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the Nicaraguan people should say ` No' to the Sandinistas.'' Chileans voted Wednesday against letting <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> extend his 15-year rule. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> complained that the law `` legalizes repression against the internal opposition to consolidate the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and gives the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> arguments for pushing military aid for the Contras.'' Both <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON>, acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, the country's main opposition group, said the government could be expected to apply the law soon. An emergency decree was in effect in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> most of the time from March 1982 until shortly after a regional peace plan was signed by the five Central American presidents in August 1987. The decree's provisions included press censorship, suspension of some civil rights, and searches without warrants. The new law goes further. It allows the president to close news media and theaters; intervene in mail or electronic correspondence; take over private vehicles and businesses; make preventive arrests, and prevent individuals from entering or leaving the country. It gives the president authority to expand or reduce his own authority to take the steps and to continue the measures until the reasons for them disappear. The law says certain basic rights can not be suspended. They include the rights to life, equality, freedom of conscience, asylum, thought and religion, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, to have personal property, and to be free from slavery in prison. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday also approved legislation banning the receipt of any type of assistance approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and destined for opposition groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, labor unions and individuals. Under the law, any person found to have accepted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance could face between four and 12 years imprisonment. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a new $ 27 million, six-month, non-military aid package for the Contras Oct. 1. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to set up an international peace force to take Contras and leftist Salvadoran rebels from its territory. It said the rebels should be taken first to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, then resettled elsewhere. Thursday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, Assistant Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> rejected that proposal. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> told reporters relocating the Contras in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> would violate that country's principles of neutrality. The only way the proposal could be considered would be for the rebels to abandon the war and become refugees or political exiles, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. A rebel leader said Thursday that some Contras in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were returning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that `` our troops are returning to their original positions'' inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The report could not be immediately confirmed. A rebel spokesman in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital, acknowledged some Contra forces had returned to Nicaraguan border provinces but declined to provide details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Contras have used base camps on the Honduran side of the border since they began fighting in 1981 to overthrow the Sandinista government.

 A peace group founded in memory of <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> marked the seventh anniversary of the Egyptian president's assassination Thursday by calling on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to hold direct talks with Palestinians, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> The New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Sadat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> also urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to permit municipal elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for the first time in 12 years. Foundation President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> accused right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of violating agreements reached by <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> in a 1979 peace treaty. Speaking at a news conference, <PERSON> George </PERSON> cited from a letter signed by both Begin and <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> providing for withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories and guaranteed elections of `` a self-governing authority'' there. `` How can you expect another <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leader to place his trust and to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> under -LRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s -RRB- leadership has violated its guarantees to President <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>?'' asked <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from 1977 to 1979. The <ORGANIZATION> Sadat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1984 by <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s widow <PERSON> Jihan </PERSON> and American admirers of the Egyptian leader, who was gunned down by Moslem extremists on Oct. 6, 1981. It includes members from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, other Arab countries, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the group called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to hold immediate talks without preconditions with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives, including members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We should accept any delegaton the Palestinians give to us. Both sides should accept any delegaton and if it's the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, so be it,'' said <PERSON> Rustum </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastuni </PERSON>, an Israeli Arab and former Israeli legislator. <PERSON> George </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should convene municipal elections in the occupied territories as soon as possible to permit the emergence of a grassroots Palestinian leadership with whom <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can talk peace. The occupied territories, where 283 Palestinians have died in a 10-month-old rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation, have not held municipal elections since 1976. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prospects for Palestinian elections in the territories `` depended on the situation there next year.'' The territories, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, were taken by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 The recently elected chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> called for an international conference on African debt during a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Thursday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, said <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that he `` wants to avoid a confrontation between debtors and creditors.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> referred enquiries about the details of <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>'s proposal to officials of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>. At the Embassy of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, an aide said all of the officials familiar with the proposal were with <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> and could not be reached. `` His party would have to speak primarily for him, but he would like to see an international conference on African debt and made that known during the meeting,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` He wants to avoid a confrontation between debtors and creditors and that's why he was stressing this global approach.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the meeting `` discussed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach in terms of dealing with individual cases, case by case, and our interest in trying to encourage those who are serious about reforming their economy and not necessarily rewarding the worst performers.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed concern that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which has been involved in war with <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, is developing the capacity to produce chemical weapons. He said the president emphasized `` the need for all of us to be vigilant in that regard.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has previously expressed concern that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has a plant that may be approaching capability to produce such weapons. `` We have an interest therefore in an international approach to take mesures against the use of such weapons,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The president proposed an international conference on the subject during his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last week. In remarks at a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>'s economic reform program, which has made the impoverished <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation a major African recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid. Since becoming chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> at the African summit in May, he told <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, `` You have already demonstrated your interest in helping to promote regional settlements in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>.'' `` We hope the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> can play an even more active role in solving those regional problems and play a key role in promoting development in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by encouraging economic reform and cooperation,'' he said. <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, in his response, said he was `` convinced ... that our discussions will enable us to make progress in the search for a solution to the problems which are of concern to both our sides.'' As he posed for photographs with <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> before their closed meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded to a question about human rights in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by saying, `` I think we are sitting beside a man in whose country that is a major goal.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the two leaders met privately for half an hour and then met in a larger group for an additional half hour. At a state dinner for <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> on Thursday night, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was `` gratified that you share our concern about regional stability and economic development in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' and added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` continue to work with you and be as supportive as we can in these areas.'' Responding to the president's toast, <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, speaking in French, said through an interpreter that the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> would continue to seek `` the taking down of the intolerable system of apartheid'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He said also that it was `` urgent to find a just and lasting solution to the problem of the African debt.''

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company and two of its executives were accused Thursday of participating with a <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> governor in a contract bid-rigging scheme that included replacing the postmaster general. The replacement of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> with <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> as postmaster general was engineered in 1986 as part of the elaborate effort by <ORGANIZATION> Recognition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to get $ 400 million worth of contracts to provide automated mail-sorting equipment, according an indictment returned here. The indictment charged that the company; REI's chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, a vice president, conspired with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, then vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> board of governors, and others to manipulate bid procedures, obtain confidential information about competitors and replace <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>, considered an obstacle to REI winning contracts. An unindicted co-conspirator, <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> received $ 19,000 in kickbacks plus $ 4,000 worth of airline tickets from a Detroit-area public relations firm headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that REI hired on <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>' recommendation, the indictment said <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, who received a four-year sentence for his 1986 guilty plea in the case, also was promised one-quarter of one percent of any revenues REI earned from <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contracts, it said. The indictment charged that through <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, REI arranged for the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to halt procurement of a multiline optical character reader system and set up a two-step test period to give it another chance to win the lucrative order. After the procurement scheme came to light in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ultimately decided to give the revised contract to <ORGANIZATION> ElectroCom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had beat out REI for the earlier phase of the contract. But if REI had won the competition, it would have been positioned to obtain procurement contracts worth $ 4.6 billion over the next five years, said <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loozen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, who headed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> presidential campaign, pleaded guilty to charges he took kickbacks totaling at least $ 30,000 on four <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contracts and expense account fraud. <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON>, another unindicted co-conspirator who headed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campaign, received a three-year sentence for conspiracy and for paying an illegal $ 2,500 gratuity to <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with the investigation along with another executive of his firm, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, who received a six-month sentence for paying illegal gratuities to <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Loozen </PERSON> said the bid rigging scandal delayed procurement of a new optical mail-scanner system for about 14 months. The system is now expected to be completely installed next May. In sentencing memos filed in the earlier cases, prosecutors estimated that the bid-rigging activities of <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON> cost the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hundreds of millions of dollars the agency planned to save through automation. The indictment charged REI, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 49, and <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, 46, both of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, with conspiracy to defraud the government, theft of <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> property, mail and wire fraud and aiding and abetting. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> each face maximum possible prison terms of 33 years and fines of more than $ 1.5 million if convicted. The company could be fined more than $ 3 million if convicted. REI spokeswoman <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said, `` Neither the company nor Mr. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> nor Mr. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> have done anything wrong. We do not believe the indictment should have been brought by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. attorney.'' `` The company, Mr. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> intend to defend this matter to the fullest extent. We are confident we will be exonerated,'' she said. In a statement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said: `` Public corruption is one of democracy's worst enemies. This indictment represents our commitment to prosecute aggressively and vigorously those who seek to strike at the heart of fairness in the procurement process by corrupting the machinery of government for personal financial gain.'' According to the indictment, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spartin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Gnau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, who also headed an executive placement firm, influenced the selection of a new postmaster by obtaining management consulting contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Spartin </PERSON>, also named an unindicted co-conspirator, used his position `` to insinuate himself into the confidence of high-level <ORGANIZATION> USPS </ORGANIZATION> and board officials'' but concealed his relationship to <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON> and REI. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> _ who became postmaster general in January 1986 and served only seven months until early August 1986 _ was one of three candidates that <PERSON> Spartin </PERSON> recommended, through <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, as a replacement for <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spartin </PERSON>, who concealed from <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> his interest in REI's effort to get a mail-sorting contract, also was instrumental in the removal of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jellison </PERSON>, a deputy postmaster general who was also regarded as an obstacle, the indictment charged. <PERSON> Spartin </PERSON> is also cooperating with authorities in the investigation, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The procurement scheme began to unravel when some postal inspectors aboard a commercial airline noticed <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> traveling in coach, even though postal governors were allowed to fly first class, sources said. Tracing his expense account vouchers, inspectors discovered that <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> had collected reimbursement for $ 70,000 worth of first-class air travel when he spent only $ 26,000 on coach seats, a prosecutor said when <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> pleaded guilty to embezzlement. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was succeeded as postmaster general in August 1986 by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Thursday progress was made in recent Iran-Iraq peace talks, but he still accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of balking on some issues and declined to comment on whether a compromise was near. `` The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation entered into substantive talks and modest progress has been made,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> after separate meetings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> side and with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` I can not go into details, but I can tell you the situation is better now than in the beginning,'' he told a news conference. Asked about the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said, `` I categorically deny there are any talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and no talks on the hostage issue.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said he was willing to resume talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s representative and with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Oct. 26 or Oct 27, if requested by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to only one negotiating session in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> renewed peace talks Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after a session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> from Aug. 25 to Sept. 13. The talks followed a cease-fire Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war, which left at least 1 million killed or wounded. <PERSON> Velyati </PERSON> emphasized he was not fully satisfied with the outcome of meetings with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and blamed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for introducing what he called extraneous issues. `` I am not altogether pleased or greatly encouraged in the pace of the talks,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. He added that both sides have not yet `` been able to achieve the goals that the secretary-general had set.'' These goals are formalization of the cease-fire, withdrawal by both sides to international boundaries and repatriation of prisoners of war, under terms of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> avoided a direct answer when asked if a compomise deal had been struck, in which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would halt searching neutral shipping in the gulf, as reported by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources. In turn, the sources said, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would postpone discussion of sovereignty over the disputed <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway between the two nations. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources have reported that such a deal, arranged by the secretary-general, was virtually in place and could break the deadlock between the two sides over clearing of the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON>, sovereignty over the channel and other issues. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> did not deny a deal in the future but emphasized that for the time being <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not give up its right to search suspect ships in time of war.

<TEXT>
 While a state judge was ruling favorably in the divorce case of <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, the former Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was calling the judge on an unlisted, private line, the judge's former law clerk testified Thursday. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> called more than a dozen times and gave an assumed name to court personnel, the law clerk also testified at the divorce-fixing trial of the two women and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case was one of the few handled personally by the judge, law clerk <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> testified. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> each face five counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and bribe-related charges in an alleged 1983 scheme to slash <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s child support and alimony payments In his second day of federal court testimony, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said that of more than 3,000 requests to change alimony and child support payments, the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case was one of the few Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> handled personally. `` I think I'll do this one myself, <PERSON> Howie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said the judge told him in July 1983 after <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s lawyer sought to delay weekly alimony and child support payments of $ 1,850 a week to <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> had given similar personal attention to other support requests, <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, who was her law secretary from 1981 until her resignation last year, said: `` Maybe one or two.'' Prosecutors charge that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the city's former cultural affairs commissioner, gave a $ 19,000 city job to Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s unemployed daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>, in order to influence the outcome of the judge's decision <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON>, the prosecution's second witness, testified that in the summer of 1983, Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> began calling the judge on a private, unlisted phone. Prosecutors contend that even though Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> knew each other, their contacts were limited until the judge began handling interim decisions in the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> divorce. <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> often called identifying herself either as `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> or <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said he did n't recognize the voice although the woman called `` a fairly large number -LRB- of times -RRB- between a dozen and two dozen.'' The clerk said he asked Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> `` who is this <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> person?'' He said the judge replied: `` Oh, that's <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> She's just being so Byzantine.'' On Sept. 14, 1983, about a month after <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> was made a special assistant to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, the judge cut <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s temporary alimony and child support payments from $ 1,850 to $ 680 a week When an Oct. 18, 1983 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> story reported the `` coincidence'' of Ms. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s hiring by the <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> if she should withdraw from the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> case. `` I think it would be a good idea,'' <PERSON> Leventhal </PERSON> said he told the judge. He said that Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> had excused herself from other cases in the past where there had been a possible conflict of interest.

 A 10-year-old boy and a Christian school's headmaster testified Thursday that a woman who teaches third grade came to the defense of her youngsters by attacking a gunman with a book. `` This is a .357 Magnum,'' headmaster <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> quoted defendant <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> as telling teacher <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>. `` I do n't care what it is _ get out of here,'' <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> quoted her as replying. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is charged with kidnapping 110 people at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> on Feb. 2. Defending himself in state court here as a crusader for people's constitutional rights, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> has called Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> `` a fiesty lady.'' Ten-year-old <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Vice </PERSON> said he saw Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> encounter <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> and another gunman in a hallway, where she began hitting <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> with a book. The other man, described by police as an unwilling accomplice, testified Thursday he was duped by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> into helping take over the school and later was threatened with his life if he tried to back out. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>, then a fourth-grader, said he was coming out of the bathroom when he saw two men walk in at the other end of the hallway. After seeing the confrontation with Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> said, he ducked into the nearest classroom. Asked why he did not return to his own class, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> said, `` I did n't want them to get me.'' <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> told the jury that when he heard of the trouble, he and a coach rushed to the elementary school building and saw Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> struggling with <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, while he held a cocked pistol pointed toward the ceiling. <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> said he and the coach then told Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> to do whatever <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> told her to do. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 43, testified that he was picking up beer cans near an unemployment office that day when <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> offered him $ 50 to help him move across town. Instead, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> drove him to the school, gave him an empty gun and told him to put it in his coat pocket. `` He said this was something he had been planning for two or three years,'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said. `` What he planned I did n't know.'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> told the jury that when he and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> entered the school, he told <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> he wanted to leave. `` You ai n't no more your own boss,'' he quoted <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> as saying. `` You do it or die.'' The two men entered the school at 8:30 a.m. and about 2:30 p.m., <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said he surrendered to an officer who offered him more money than <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> promised. `` He asked me if $ 300 would do me any good. I said yes. I gave him the gun and I walked out. I was wanting to go anyway.'' Kidnapping charges against <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> were dropped after authorities decided he was an unwilling participant. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> surrendered after 12 hours when authorities produced a videotape in which Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who is to testify Friday at <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s insistence, offered a bogus pardon. Cross-examining six <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> policemen who identified weapons taken from the school, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> suggested the guns showed he `` was very serious about what he believed.'' `` I had a right to act as a steward for those children and their future ... against pollution, deceit and people who are destroying the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said while questioning one officer.

 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> official who helped set <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration policies regulating biology research said Thursday he is resigning to resume research, not because the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating him for possible financial conflicts of interest. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> for biological, behavioral and social sciences for the last four years, said he is resigning because `` I want to go back to the laboratory.'' He confirmed that a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of his financial interests is continuing, but said, `` That's not why I've resigned. <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> formally leaves the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 15, and assumes a new position as a full professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 1. He said the university job will include continuation of a research project that has been under way for several years and `` now is at a critical point.'' In his letter of resignation, dated Sept. 23, <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> said he was making the move to return to research and because of `` the stress on both the agency and me over the past year resulting from publicity about my activities outside <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION>.'' He acknowledged that he has been accused of having improper connections with biotechnology companies that could have been affected by <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> policies, but denied that there is a conflict. <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> said that shortly after his appointment to the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, he submitted a list of his holdings to the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. He said the counsel advised him to sell only one investment, stock in the <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a biotechnology company. The other holdings were not considered to be a conflict of interest, he said. Some companies in which he holds stock have been incorrectly identified as biotechnology companies, said <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>, saying, `` Whether or not they are biotechnology companies is a matter of interpretation.'' He identified one of his holdings as <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION>, a company that he said makes laboratory equipment, but does no biotechnology research. <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> said he has hired an attorney to assist him in the continuing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe, but that the investigation started more than a year ago and nothing has come of it. `` I have not been charged with any conflict of interest,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> announced <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>'s resignation last week in a two-paragraph statement from <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> director. In the statement, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> would not comment on an investigation of <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>, but did note that `` concerns have arisen and have been under consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concerning certain of Dr. <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>'s financial and business relationships, especially with regard to financial disclosure.'' <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> researcher and a specialist in the genetics of brain ailments, such as Alzheimer's disease. At the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION>, he has been a major influence on policies regulating the biotechnology industry during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Experts representing the Environmental Defense Fund have charged that <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> helped formulate regulations that favored the biotechnology industry and genetic experiments. `` <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>'s past history has been pro-industry,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldburg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EDF </ORGANIZATION> scientist. She said <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration were ineffective in setting policies regulating experiments using organisms that have been altered genetically in the laboratory.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s answers to debate questions about what he would do if suddenly elevated to the presidency hardly dispelled doubts about his fitness for the No. 2 job, several political analysts said Thursday.

Some of the experts _ including political consultants and political science professors _ said they felt the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had been over-coached by his campaign handlers, and was therefore too programmed to cope with nettlesome and unexpected questions. `` If you've ever had a close friend have to give a toast or speech, and just could n't do it, that's how I felt when I watched'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> struggle with hypothetical questions Wednesday night about taking over the presidency because of an emergency, said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>.

 The day after an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> draft report sharply criticized <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> management, the nuclear facility suffered an equipment failure that led to a release of radioactive tritium gas. The escape of less than .01 millirems of the gas into the atmosphere Thursday morning posed no threat to health, said plant spokeswoman <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>. Workers at the plant, the nation's only producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were not evacuated. `` The tritium ... was released into the atmosphere from the facility's stack,'' a statement issued by the plant's management said. `` The accidental release occurred as the result of equipment failure during routine operations inside the Tritium Facility.'' A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest X-ray totals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that an anti-discrimination law protecting the handicapped extends to employees with the AIDS virus if they are in the federal workforce or have jobs in programs receiving federal aid. The opinion by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> is in line with a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last year and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The opinion also says that those with the AIDS virus in whom the disease has progressed can be excluded from the workplace if they pose a threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to their job. Since the available medical information shows that the risk of infection being transmitted in the normal course of the workplace is very low, an AIDS-infected employee `` by and large ... should be treated like any other employee,'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> OLC </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference where he discussed the opinion. <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON> said an AIDS-infected employee `` should be assessed for his ability to do the job like anyone else.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, alarmed by used syringes and vials of AIDS-infected blood washing up on shorelines, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday in approving legislation to combat the dumping of medical waste. `` The illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an epidemic across the country,'' said the bill's floor manager, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` This waste is not just repulsive; it can literally kill people. `` According to recent federal studies, as many as 18,000 people each year may contract hepatitis B from accidental contact with medical waste,'' he said. `` Hundreds of those infected will ultimately die from the infection.'' The bill, approved 390-28, would require the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to set up a system to track infectious or dangerous trash from hospitals, labs and clinics to its disposal.

 Regulations that took effect Thursday forbidding future police officers and firefighters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> from smoking either on or off the job are producing resentment and expectations that the law will be challenged in court. The law, aimed at cutting health care and pension costs, is the first of its kind in the nation.

 The work of Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> fills every playground, every classroom and every mother's arms for miles around. Pick any woman and child on any street in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> counties in rural east-central <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and chances are that woman was <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' patient, and that child was brought into the world by his hands. In big cities, expectant mothers shop for doctors or midwives and hospitals compete for maternity business. But in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, particularly the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the West, such choices are increasingly rare. Women often must travel for an hour or more for a doctor's care and a hospital delivery room For 15 years, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> chose to do what fewer and fewer doctors are willing to do: he delivered babies and cared for women in a piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where the need was acute, the population poor and the facilities desperately limited. He delivered the future here, and his sudden death July 13 at the age of 53 turned that future darker and more uncertain for a generation of babies and their parents. `` They want to know ` What do we do now?''' <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' office nurse, said of his legion of patients, at least 100 of whom are pregnant. `` I just inform them we do n't have a doctor in the office to see them. And the saddest part of all, we do n't even have a referring physician to send them to.'' In <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> lived, there is not even a hospital since <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> closed in 1987. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> kept his office there, the only doctor in a mostly empty building with an overgrown lawn. But every day at dawn, he drove along 25 miles of narrow highway to <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to do his rounds. After morning rounds, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> often performed surgery, then drove back to <LOCATION> Tuskegee </LOCATION> for office hours six days a week. With the office and the three county clinics where he consulted, he might see 1,500 patients a month and deliver an average of two babies a day. At night, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> unwound by reading medical journals. He talked about retiring to a life of travel and golf, but no one who knew him took him seriously. `` He just worked, worked, worked,'' Nurse <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` He would n't take time out to take a break or a rest or eat a decent lunch. I think he cared more about his patients than he did himself, I really do.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' patients, many already suffering the effects of poor nutrition, high blood pressure or other conditions exacerbated by poverty, needed extra care: 90 percent were high-risk, requiring special attention and sometimes frequent hospitalization throughout their pregnancies. Their risk status went hand-in-hand with their economic status: those with the greatest need often were the least able to pay. Most of them were uninsured or underinsured and could not afford a ride to his office, much less an obstetrician's bill. `` Try to pay me something, if it's not but a dollar a month,'' he'd tell his patients, and they never were afraid to come to him, no matter how little they had in their pocketbooks. Those who were n't within walking distance were often ferried to appointments by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, who started working in his father's office while in 7th grade. The whole family helped. Wife <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> worked as office manager; <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> and daughters <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> ran errands and took patients' blood pressure and weight. Behind their comfortable split-level house lay another part of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' life they all shared, 10 acres of land where they kept horses, cows and chickens and grew vegetables. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, raised by his farmer grandfather, arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with every intention of returning to the land. Instead, he met and married <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, took the medical aptitude tests as a lark and did well enough to be admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Meharry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. Later, he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, serving at bases in Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Blytheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, where he became the first black hospital commander. His career was filled with honors, but he never spoke of them. All his patients knew was that he saved their lives and he saved their babies.

 In the nine months he worked at <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, its infant mortality rate dropped from 26 deaths per 1,000 _ among the nation's highest _ to 5.1 deaths, half the national average. `` If it was n't for him, I would be dead,'' said <PERSON> Pinkie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, whose last three children, and three grandchildren, were delivered by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Her most recent pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially life-threatening condition in which the embryo develops outside the uterus. In rare instances, the pregnancy goes to term; that is what happened to <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Tari </PERSON>, is now 5. When the operation was over, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> called in six doctors, she recalled. `` He was laughing and smiling. He was kind of happy, because he thought he was going to lose me or something. Every last one of the hospital staff members came in, even the cooks out of the kitchen. I woke up and said, ` What are y' all doing up here? `` He said, ` Ms. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, you are going down in history.''' It was not just the fact that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was there to do what had to be done, his patients say. It was the way he did it. `` When I had my daughter, I had a very hard time,'' <PERSON> Gennell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dix </PERSON> said. `` I stayed in labor, hard labor, for 26 hours. When it was over, I woke up looking for Dr. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. You know how a little child says, when <PERSON> Mommy </PERSON> or Daddy comes in, it makes it all better? That's the way it was with him. He came in, full of joy, and a lot of times, he embraced his patients.'' <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> stopped offering obstetrical services with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' death and stopped searching for a replacement on Sept. 15. The task proved impossible, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Priori </PERSON>, who heads the hospital board. Every year, 12 percent of OB-GYNs stop delivering babies. Those who continue rarely choose to work in small towns with big problems. Twenty-nine of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s 67 counties have no OB-GYN. The hospital looked for help to a federal program, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which gives scholarships to medical students who agree to serve in needy areas. Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, however, the program's budget has gone from $ 100 million in 1978 to $ 2 million this year, and the number of scholarships is down from more than 3,000 to just 40. <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which could n't afford to wait even two months, was told to wait another year. The job of finding a replacement was complicated by the fact that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> literally did the work of two. `` He was on call virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brookhart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> administrator. `` When an obstetrician looks at the types of need that exist, they're going to say, ` I need some back-up I need some days off.' I think that made it twice as difficult.'' In the week before his death, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> delivered 10 babies, including two by Caesarean section. The last was a 7-pound, 11-ounce boy named <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>. His own son, now a third-year medical student at his father's alma mater, spent the summer working with him, including the last 24 hours. `` On Tuesday, he had a delivery, a D and C, and a C-section. Then he did his rounds in surgery. We went to the office, and then he stayed at the hospital until 9 p.m.,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> drove home, and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> stayed overnight in the hospital's on-call room. His father awakened him at 6 the next morning to do rounds before the elder <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> performed a hysterectomy. `` I was in surgery with him,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` I'm dizzy. He slumped forward. They started cardiac resuscitation. `` That was one of the worst feelings I have ever had in my life,'' he said. `` I felt helpless.'' Another doctor, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jehle </PERSON>, was flown in by emergency helicopter from a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> hospital to complete the surgery. <PERSON> Jehle </PERSON> had recently cut obstetrics out of her own practice because of the long hours. At the funeral, more than 1,000 people crowded into the church. Many more went to the funeral home, their children in tow. `` One lady picked up her baby and said, ` This is Dr. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. This is who delivered you,''' <PERSON> Dix </PERSON> said. `` She had a picture taken. She did n't ever want to forget him.''

 Who's <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>? She's Mae West, <PERSON> Morticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Addams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> caught up in a Cuisinart. Who's <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>? She's <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> was always <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>, I was always <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON>. Now the line is kind of blurring. Sometimes I do n't know who I am,'' says <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, the host of a horror movie series who's just made her first movie, `` Elvira: Mistress of the Dark.'' `` <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> becomes like my real self, which I try to do. Sometimes I become like <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>. I throw Elvira-isms into what I do and say, depending on my mood.'' Most of those Elvira-isms are unprintable _ they go far beyond `` <LOCATION> Beulah </LOCATION>, peel me a grape.'' `` People say I have a lot in common with <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` I was a never a big fan of hers but I can certainly now see the common thread. We're both kind of the bad gal with a heart of gold character. Lots of double entendres.'' They also share a similar anatomy: <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> is well endowed. For the uninitiated, <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> is the host of `` Movie Macabre,'' broadcast locally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Her fame quickly grew, moving beyond talk show appearances and commercials into a fan club and marketing windfall, with <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> records, greeting cards, T-shirts, comic books and key chains. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> developed her alter ego seven years ago. `` I thought the movie would be a great idea for this character,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` The film companies did n't think I had enough nationwide appeal but then I got spots on <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. `` Once I became national, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> saw the potential and signed me up.'' As for <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, she is quite unlike her alter ego. She has long red hair and dressed very simply in jeans and a leotard shirt for a recent interview. She is married to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>, her manager. <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and had the good fortune to have a mother who owned a costume shop. `` I dressed up all the time. I would dress like Miss Kitty from ` Gunsmoke.' My aunt sent me this funny picture of me as a witch when I was 5 years old. I've got on a black wig and a witch dress. I look like a 5-year-old <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>,'' she said. Her love for switching costumes and identities did not equip her for the stage. In fact, she flunked her high school drama class. `` I was playing in ` Our Town.' I kept telling jokes, making funny faces. I got kicked out of the part. I was the class clown. I was making a farce of it,'' she said. `` Our Town'' was never for <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>; `` Viva Las Vagas'' is more her style. In fact, in the 1960s when she was 17, she worked as a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> showgirl. `` I try to keep it really campy,'' she said. `` The film company thinks it a men's cult. It's straight camp. It's a very self-depreciating character. It's all a kind of setup. Some people do n't get it and some do. `` It's like being a cartoon character. It's like a male Pee-wee -LRB- <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> -RRB-. A walking cartoon.'' Her costume and alter ego allow her a certain amount of privacy, she says. `` That is one of the great things. I'm the world's luckiest celebrity. If I want to put on no makeup and put on curlers and go walking down <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, nobody will know it's me,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. However, fame caught up to her last month when <PERSON> Maila </PERSON> `` Vampire'' <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON>, a former horror hostess, filed a $ 10 million suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, claiming she had developed the <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> character in the 1950s before <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. `` Horror hostesses are all wearing just about the same outfit,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` You've got pretty slim parameters. Mine were that I had to be in black and had to have black hair and look sexy. Any similarity is purely coincidental. If someone told you to look like <PERSON> Dracula </PERSON>, what would you wear?'' But <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> is n't just a black dress and wig, it's a whole other person. `` I always compare it to someone at a costume party. If you're in a total disguise, you kind of go wild Nobody knows who you are. You might do things you otherwise would n't do. They suddenly become these wild animals. When I put on this costume and wig, I become this wild underside of my character.''

Executive producer <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> hopes to get back on track soon _ the show begins its 14th season Saturday _ but laments missing seven shows that would have culminated in a nostalgic season-ender with <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>. `` If there had been a strike in 1985, I would n't have minded it so much,'' said <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> in an interview in his <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> office. `` But we were in such good rhythm. Our ratings were going up every week. ... I just thought we were doing very good work. It was an election year, the writing was there, the cast was there.'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> launched the show in 1975, and with it the careers of <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> left in 1980 to produce movies, but returned in 1985. A rushed-together cast spent an unhappy season under crushingly negative reviews. In 1986, the show rebounded with a new cast that has remained intact for three seasons. This group seems to have shaken off the ghosts of the now-fabled originals. <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> played <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> off <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s edge-of-hysteria takeoff on Congresswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvey </PERSON> did a brilliant <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> opposite <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> himself, as his own father. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, who can do everybody from <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> to <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, perfected <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said he had felt out of touch with the late-night audience when he came back in 1985 and unwisely heeded advice to target the show to some nebulous notion of a new and younger audience. `` And so you start putting on stuff you do n't think is funny or that you're not comfortable with or a musical group that happens to be hot at that moment, booking from the charts instead of from your tastes,'' he said. `` And it's disorienting, because if you fail that way, as I did, you go, well, where's the satisfaction? There's no satisfaction So after that season, I went back to, I'm going to put on the things that I think are good and hopefully I'm not that out of step.'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, 43, now oversees a staff of writers who in some cases were in junior high school when SNL premiered. `` You know, there's a certain point where you're sitting in a room, and it's 2 o'clock in the morning, and you're saying, ` I do n't think it will work,' words that as you hear them coming out of your head, you realize these people, and sometimes those people are 25 or 26, and they're looking at you, and you think, ` They're thinking, he's old and annoying. And you know that you think it wo n't work because you wrote it three times, you produced it eight times, and it did n't work any of the 11 times. They're thinking, ` He just does n't get it.''' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> produced the Emmy Awards show for <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> this summer, livening up the proceedings and keeping the show mercifully short. He says it's an experience he feels he needs only only once in his life, though. Now, besides shepherding SNL, he is helping launch two new shows: _ `` Sunday Night,'' a variety show that premiered on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last Sunday, will feature an eclectic assemblage of musical guests. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jools </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> are co-hosts. Comedian <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON> is a regular. _ `` Kids in the Hall,'' an <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> series featuring a young comedy troupe from <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>' home town of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` There is a time in people's careers which is more interesting for me to be working with them ... to watch people come into their own and just blossom,'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said. Earlier in the day, at an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> press conference about the new season of `` Saturday Night Live,'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> was asked what was new to say after 14 years. `` Our show is one that will always be described as uneven, and I think there's a point in the development of a cast when they sort of hit stride. Our cast, before we were taken off the air -LRB- by the strike -RRB- had hit stride. `` I think this season will be a great season,'' he said. `` And I have n't said that the last three years.''

<TEXT>
 Children around the world have played with springy Slinkies for 43 years, but the 70-year-old woman who helped invent the wire toy says it has n't been all fun and games. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says her late husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer and naval architect, came up with the idea of the toy in 1943 while aboard a ship. He saw a torsion spring fall from a table and bounce. Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> took control of the business in 1960, when her husband lost interest and left the family to join what she called a religious cult in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. He died there in 1974. `` To this day,'' she said, `` I do n't know what a torsion spring is.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Industries </PERSON> is a spartan, no-nonsense firm that turns out Slinkies by the millions in this small central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town. It employs 120 people who manufacture, package, sell and ship Slinkies from a single building. A grandmother of 10, Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> says she's basically a doting mother devoted to her six adult children and their families. According to her oldest son, she's also a demanding and assertive boss. `` She expects a lot out of you. She expects you to produce. And, so you do produce,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 46. He is Slinky sales manager and the only one of three sons and three daughters to join the family business. Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who is known as `` Big <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>,'' is not too big to take telephone messages for her staff and do many other tasks. `` When we first moved into this building, I used to clean the toilets, too,'' she said. She's been involved in every aspect of production and promotion. <PERSON> Slinky </PERSON> was put on the market in 1945, after the <ORGANIZATION> Jameses </ORGANIZATION> spent two years experimenting with various types of steel. After receiving a patent, they demonstrated the toys at a <ORGANIZATION> Gimbel </ORGANIZATION>'s department store in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` They gave us the end of a counter so we could show how it walked,'' Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> recalled. `` I was so scared that no one would buy them, I called a friend and asked her to come along. I thought we would each buy one if nobody else did,'' she said. She need n't have worried. After a quick demonstration, the first 400 Slinkies sold out in 90 minutes at a dollar each. `` I was so taken aback when I saw this crowd of people _ and everyone was waving dollar bills.'' Each night, Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> took the day's production home from the manufacturer and wrapped the Slinkies by hand with yellow paper. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, meanwhile, came up with other inventions, but none were successful. `` He was a dreamer,'' she said. `` He developed a refrigerator that would dispense soft drinks, but we took it out because we were drinking so many soft drinks we were getting fat. He also wanted to work on an amphibious car.'' When her husband left, Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> struggled to keep the business alive to feed herself and her children. `` To me, my family is the most precious thing in life. ... I always wanted a family because I was an only child,'' she said. `` You do what you have to do for them. I did what I had to do.'' The first Slinky plant was in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION> section. Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>, 180 miles away, 23 years ago because she had family and friends in the area who could help care for her children. The family moved a year and a half before the company's move was complete, and Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> commuted to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> each week. She drove to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Sunday evenings, returning home on Thursdays. `` It was hard to see her crying because she had to leave the six of us,'' her son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said. Today, <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> sells millions of Slinkies around the world. Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who with her children owns all company stock, declined to release the number of units sold annually or annual sales figures. Slinkies usually retail for less than $ 2. The company produces other toys, including building blocks, plastic rings, games and pin wheels. `` But <PERSON> Slinky </PERSON> outsells them all,'' Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` It's simple. It's a universal toy. It's a toy that does n't need any explanation It has intrinsic play value,'' her son said. `` There are very few other toys like that.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Industries </PERSON> began producing brightly colored plastic Slinkies in 1979, to appeal to younger children, especially infants. Mrs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> and her son gasp at the thought of updating the television commercial jingle that declares `` Slinky, Slinky ... Everyone loves a Slinky.'' The song was written in 1963. `` We'll just stick to something that's good,'' she said.

<HEAD>Health Care Costs Are Soaring Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cost of health care is rising sharply again, and among the reasons why, incredibly, is the success of past cost-containment efforts. Yes, you read it correctly. This seemingly illogical, almost impossible state of affairs _ cost cutting leading to inflation _ illustrates the pernicious financial nature of the health-care beast, which avoids the most carefully laid anti-inflation traps. The origins of the latest price spurt go back to the early and mid-1980s when, you might recall, health-care officials in every area of the industry felt drastic measures were required. At that time, according to a consultant on corporate benefits, the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen </PERSON> concern, many state Medicaid programs, private-sector benefit plans and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> tackled costs with a vengeance. Among other things, they implemented case-based hospital reimbursement systems, set up hospital utilization review programs and shifted costs from employers to employees. Dispensers and users of services, therefore, would be put on the side of cost containment. It would be in their financial interest. It worked. Hospital utilization and occupancy rates fell. While that might seem to be a positive result, it was n't entirely so The reason: To hospitals, each dollar saved through cost containment was a revenue dollar lost. To correct it, they had to cut expenses _ or rebuild revenues. Cutting expenses can appear easier than it is. For example, hospitals have many fixed costs for plant and equipment that do no decline as occupancy rates fall. The situation can force administrators to seek higher revenues. The most frustrating illustration of this, according to the consulting firm's report, is in ambulatory surgery. In designing cost-containment strategies, many sponsors of health insurance plans identified hospital surgical procedures that could be performed safely in an outpatient surgical facility. These sponsors began to encourage workers to have certain types of surgery performed on an outpatient basis, thus saving the cost of a one-day or two-day hospital stay. Employees were offered financial incentives to do so. Now, says <PERSON> Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen </PERSON>, these corporate sponsors are finding that outpatient facility charges are as high as $ 3,000 for as little as a few hours use. `` Ironically,'' it states, `` in many instances plan costs would actually be reduced if these surgeries were again performed in the hospital, since the cost of one day there can be less expensive than the surgical facility charge.'' This is just one illustration of the difficulties involved in holding the line on health care costs. There are plenty of other reasons, including the changing natures of health and illness themselves. AIDS, for instance, was not a cost factor until relatively recently. Now, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates that total expenses for one patient might be as high as $ 150,000 between diagnosis and death. Other cost problems involve the increasing price of medical education, an investment that must be recovered; the surging cost of certain malpractice insurance, and the defensive medical tests and procedures now being used. But much of the inflation problems lie within the nature of the industry itself. Putting a dollar cost on life remains one of man's most difficult challenges, one from which even the most hardnosed executives retreat Meanwhile, many companies and others who sponsor health insurance plans are confronted with enormous increases in their bills. While the economy in general worries about 4.5 percent inflation, the consulting firm's report states that many plan sponsors have seen their bills rise this year by 30 percent to 80 percent.

<HEAD>Two New Books Praise and Assail Indonesia's Co-Founder Sukarno</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> who died in disgrace 18 years ago is again stirring controversy in the nation he led to independence from the Dutch after World War II. Two recently published books spotlight the leader whose vivid personality has an almost mythic hold on many Indonesians who refer to themselves as Sukarnoists. In the memoirs of Col. <PERSON> Bambang </PERSON> <PERSON> Widjanarko </PERSON>, his military aide from 1960 to 1968, <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> is portrayed as helplessly buffeted by political forces beyond his control during an aborted communist coup Sept. 30, 1965. Some critics complained that <PERSON> Bambang </PERSON>'s `` Eight Years Near Sukarno'' glosses over <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>'s shortcomings, but it is the less controversial of the two books. The other book, in the view of Sukarnoists, should be banned for blackening the reputation of the nation's co-founder. It is titled `` He Who Sows The Wind Will Reap The Storm'' and says <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> was involved in the aborted coup and was a committed Marxist since his student days in the 1920s. Written by <PERSON> Sugiarso </PERSON> <PERSON> Surojo </PERSON>, a former intelligence officer who now edits a women's magazine, `` He Who Sows'' describes <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> as `` a conspirator adept at concealing his true identity.'' Charges of complicity in the uprising in which six top army generals were slain are not new. Several military tribunals heard testimony years ago that <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> knew the coup was planned but did nothing to prevent it. Earlier foes also denounced what they saw as his demogoguery, hedonistic lifestyle and tilt toward the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is now banned. <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> remained as president in name only after signing over power on March 11, 1966, to Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, who foiled the revolt five months earlier. <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, who is now 66, are the only presidents this country has known. <PERSON> Sugiarso </PERSON> said he was inspired to write his book partly by the revival of Sukarnoism during last year's general election campaign. Thousands of young Indonesians in red T-shirts and headbands thronged rallies in support of the <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a grouping of five political parties, one of which was founded by <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> 61 years ago. The party had been faring poorly and its leaders calculated correctly that the <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> magnetism would help revive its fortunes. With <PERSON> Megawati </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>'s daughters, among the successful candidates last year, the party increased its representation in the 500-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from 24 to 40 members and its proportion of the total vote from 7.9 to 11 percent. With Sukarnoism making a comeback among youth, <PERSON> Sugiarso </PERSON> said, his book is intended to balance what he called a lopsided view of history fostered by the country's founding generation. `` The time has come for our national history to be straightened, written objectively, so as to be a mirror for our future leaders and for the young generation who have not known their true national history,'' he said. Attorney General <PERSON> Sukarton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmosudjono </PERSON> described the book as unethical but rejected calls to ban it. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Rudini </PERSON> also objected to the book and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Harsudiono </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartas </PERSON>, chief of the armed forces social and political section, urged a stop to the <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> `` polemic.'' No sales figures were available but booksellers said it was moving briskly. <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> was officially forgotten and rarely mentioned favorably in ruling circles after his death at the age of 69 from a kidney ailment June 21, 1970. Once hailed for his vision of a unified nation free of Dutch colonial rule, his economic policies had virtually bankrupted <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Popular interest in <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> was reignited after the government decided in 1979 to build an elaborate tomb for his remains, replacing a simple grave that was covered by a faded yellow parasol. Newspapers were allowed for the first time in years to mention his name. Portraits of <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> went on sale and a two-week exhibit of memorabilia attracted throngs. Books he wrote books came off the banned list. Statues of <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> and the country's first vice president and co-founder, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatta </PERSON>, were dedicated in 1980 at the site where they declared independence on Aug. 17, 1945. <PERSON> Hatta </PERSON> resigned in 1956, partly as a result of disenchantment with <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>'s leadership, and died in 1980 <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>'s efficient new airport was renamed the SukarnoHatta International Airport three years ago. The son of a schoolteacher and a Balinese dancer, <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> became one of the best known nationalists in what then was the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> after forming a political party in 1927. The Dutch sentenced him to four years in prison in 1929. Freed in 1931, he was arrested again the following year and spent the next eight years in exile in the outer islands. His exile ended when the Japanese invaded during World War II and freed him. Some Indonesians accused him of collaborating with the Japanese. Following their declaration of independence in 1945, <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hatta </PERSON> raised an army and and took to the jungle for a four-year struggle against the Dutch. Although the Dutch captured and again exiled <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> in 1948, his battle for independence stirred world opinion, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> urged freedom for the nation. <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> was freed in 1949 and later that year the Dutch relinquished power.

 <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> never answered the call of the wild and rarely got the attention she craved from her famous father. But despite a somewhat sheltered childhood and unremarkable life, she remains a striking link to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, a man whose tales of struggles for survival made him one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most beloved authors. If <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were alive today, he'd enjoy spinning yarns with his only surviving child. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, 85, has a few of her own, many about the man she still lovingly refers to as `` Daddy.'' `` Talking with <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> is like having a chat with her father,'' says <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> expert and a friend of the writer's daughter `` Even her letters read like a Jack <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> story.'' <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Becky </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> has never been one to take advantage of her father's fame, she says. But recently she's immersed herself in her roots She began using her maiden name after her husband died in 1982. Most of her life has been spent in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, the author's home city for years. Six years ago she moved north into an apartment annex of the <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bookstore </ORGANIZATION> in the Valley of the Moon. Occasionally, she visits the nearby ranch, now a state historical park, where the writer was living when he died in 1916. She also has made public appearances and lectures, and cheerfully obliges with anecdotes about him for visitors to her home, decorated with pictures of cats, dogs and her father, along with his books _ `` The Call of the Wild,'' `` The <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION>,'' `` White Fang.'' It is a fitting devotion for a woman who says proudly that her paternal connection is still the greatest thing that ever happened to her. With her round face and engaging personality, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> is `` almost a clone of her father,'' according to <LOCATION> Kingman </LOCATION>, who runs the bookstore in this idyllic <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community. `` She has the same love for other people, the same knack for making other people feel that they're important, the same bubbly personality.'' Both <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, were products of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s first marriage, to <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddern </PERSON>. They were divorced when <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> was a year old, and her jealous mother never allowed her to visit her father at the ranch with his second wife, <PERSON> Charmian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kingman </PERSON> says <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, who wrote a biography of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and worked for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> for 30 years before dying in 1972, was the author's favorite daughter <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, who adored him, only had one full day with him by herself, when <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> was sick. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> was only 14 when he died. `` Otherwise, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> was the caboose,'' says <LOCATION> Kingman </LOCATION>. `` He never had time for her. It's a tragedy.'' Though she wishes they could have spent more time together, there is no trace of bitterness to her voice. `` He still is my model of what a father ought to be,'' <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> says. `` Of course, he was human, he had his faults.'' Among her memories are numerous outings the writer had with his two daughters. `` He used to take us to an amusement park in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>,'' she recalls. `` We went to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with him when we were older, taking the train, the ferry boat and the cable cars. Oh, how <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> loved cable cars!'' Her father did n't talk a lot about himself with his daughters, preferring to focus on their lives, she says. It was n't until she was about 10, when she was dusting a bookcase and pulled out book after book he'd written, that she discovered he was famous. `` I still remember how dumbfounded I was,'' she says, shaking her head. But the public was aware of his fame. `` It was thrilling to go out with <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> because everybody knew him and he was always so gracious to them,'' she said. `` Daddy bought us taffy candy and we'd walk up Market Street and everybody in the city, it seemed, would stop and talk to him. Sailors, hobos, businessmen wearing silk hats, ladies in carriages, boxers _ he knew them all. I was so proud. Sometimes he'd shake hands and leave them a $ 5 gold piece.'' He also took personal charge of the girls' education, sending them a trunkful of books to read every year. Stories about heroes were a frequent choice, along with history books. Today, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> has lost her treasured ability to read because of deteriorating eyesight. She spends much of her time chatting with friends, listening to baseball games on the radio _ she's a big fan of the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> _ and savoring positive memories. `` I was born an optimist,'' she says. `` I do n't worry. I'm happy all the time.''

 Hunched over slightly, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> steadies his .22 - caliber pistol and fires, blowing pea-sized holes in a target's black bull The 10-year-old is probably as good a shot as any at a popular suburban shooting range. But there's another side of the story about children and firearms, especially in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> recently made it easier for residents to buy and carry sidearms. In <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> alone, 37 youths 18 years old and under have been fatally shot this year, 13 more than in all of 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office. Just this summer, the body of a 14-year-old boy was hidden for 10 days by three young brothers in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> who panicked when a shotgun they were playing with accidentally discharged; a 14-year-old boy was accidentally shot to death by his older brother in the farming town of <LOCATION> Pahokee </LOCATION>; an 11-year-old boy shot in the head by a playmate remains hospitalized in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. And an 11-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> boy was shot and killed during a so-called game of `` courage.'' Three friends were charged with manslaughter. Police blame the tragedies on improperly stored weapons, peer pressure, television violence and irresponsible adults. They also cite relaxed state gun laws that have increased the number of firearms in some communities. `` We're too gun-happy,'' says veteran <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> homicide Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. `` There are so many guns lying around in people's homes and cars that naturally kids are going to get into them. Some children such as <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> get gun safety instruction at home, but those killed and wounded often have little or no knowledge of firearms. As part of a national effort, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a program in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> elementary schools focusing on gun safety. Although state Education Commissioner <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Castor </PERSON> has flatly rejected the idea, some school districts, including <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, are looking at some form of gun education. Schools could help counter the feeling among many youths that guns are `` cool,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an educator at a school where a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> youth was recently slain with a handgun. `` We need to give more information on handguns _ not how to use them but the dangers involved,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, assistant principal of <ORGANIZATION> Glades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where seventh grader <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayorga </PERSON> had just started summer school when he was killed. `` Maybe they need to see a picture of someone with their head blown up,'' he suggested, acknowledging that may be too graphic. `` We need to show them the final outcome ... the anguish caused to parents and friends.'' <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> and some friends got together July 12, unsupervised at the home of a girl who had found the gun earlier under a dresser, and they devised a Russian Roulette-style game to test each other's courage The game involved distracting the `` victim'' while one of them unloaded the gun, according to <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Det </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Butchko </PERSON>. Tragically, when <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> was playing the victim the gun remained loaded. He was killed instantly. Three teens now face manslaughter charges and will be tried in juvenile court, <PERSON> Butchko </PERSON> said. Deadly games of chance killed three other <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> youths _ ages 14, 16 and 18 _ this year in separate incidents, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office. `` It's amazing there have n't been more cases like that,'' said detective <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. The problem is not unique to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, of course. Nationwide, 328 youths 19 years old and under were killed by firearms in 1985, the latest year for which figures are available, according to the Maryland-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> believe that television violence may have a role in encouraging children to glamorize guns and not treat them seriously. `` I think TV to a great extent is responsible because a lot of children know absolutely nothing about guns other than what they see on TV, and those are the wrong things,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>. The level of violence consumed by the average child appears to have increased in recent years, with more movies available on videocassette and cable television, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Redecki </PERSON>, research director for the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>. He estimated that the average child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by age 18, will witness on TV 32,000 murders, 40,000 attempted murders and 225,000 acts of violence. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is pushing for an elementary-level gun safety program that would focus on the concept of `` No. Go. Tell.'' That is, if a youngster sees a gun, neither to pick it up nor to get near someone handling it but to tell an adult about it. `` Regardless of where you stand philosophically on the issue, the common ground upon which we must all stand is the safety and protection of children,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> insists. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>, spokesman for the state education commissioner, said his boss `` simply does not feel it is the school's responsibility to teach about guns. She also is against any sort of state-mandated program regardless of what you think about the issue; schools have all they can handle now.'' <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> did n't know of any districts considering firearms education, and Ms. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said she could not identify those which she said had expressed an interest in the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> proposal or something similar. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, however, has a committee studying the issue. `` I think we're treading on some dangerous ground ... We know it's a critical issue but it's incumbent upon us to carefully plan,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON>, executive director of general and basic skills education for the county. She said the likely target of gun safety information would be parents, who could in turn discuss the issue with their children. Ten-year-old <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, who goes to the shooting range every few weeks, is n't so sure that talking to kids in school about guns will help stop them from getting hurt. He said his father, who accompanies him on the outings, has taught him well about firearm safety, but `` not all people have as good a father.'' Reciting his No. 1 safety rule, he said, `` As far as I'm concerned, every gun is loaded.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some people are betting that the devastating drought of 1988 is over, that next year will see a return to normalcy in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop production. After all, they say, that's been the historical pattern. There were helpful rains the last couple of months, and the crop growing season has virtually ended. So there is less news about the drought, although in huge areas of the nation dryness still prevails, the deep, subsoil kind that will require a foot or two of precipitation to remedy. All in all, say <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists, most farmers and ranchers have survived the crop and pasture losses better than some thought possible at midyear when heat and drought were so rampant. One important note of optimism came recently from the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Drought temporarily slowed the recovery in farmland values, but appraisers think land prices will climb at a healthy clip in 1989. `` Land prices primarily reflect long-term expectations for farm income, interest rates and other factors,'' says agency economist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON>. `` But short-term events such as the drought can reduce farmers' liquidity, which in turn reduces the demand for farmland or increases supply of land on the market if farms fail.'' A survey of rural appraisers in August indicated that farmland prices nationwide rose 1.2 percent from May 1 to the end of July, slightly behind the 1.8 percent increase for the preceding three months. Looking to this fall, the appraisers said they expected land values to rise an average of only 0.9 percent from Aug. 1 through October. But they also indicated farmland values may rise 4.6 percent in 1989, faster than a 3.6 percent increase forecast last May prior to the main drought impact. `` If the inflation rate continues to edge upward, farmland values may improve,'' <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said. `` However, wariness about next year's growing conditions, farm incomes and interest rates seem to be dampening the near-term outlook, particularly in areas where the drought has been most severe.'' By reducing grain output, driving up commodity prices and putting livestock producers in a bind for forage and emergency feed supplies, the drought took a further toll of producers who had suffered the financial crunch of earlier years. `` There likely wo n't be as many farms next year as there would have been without the 1988 drought,'' says another agency economist, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, in the October issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. Drought, he said, created financial hardships that `` have accelerated many of the forces that were already leading to fewer but larger farms'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This consolidation, or decline in farm numbers, occurred rapidly _ averaging almost 3 percent a year _ after the peak in 1935 of 6.81 million farms. Then, in the early 1970s, exploding export markets made farming financially attractive. According to the 1982 census of agriculture, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, the number of farms in the preceding decade declined only 0.4 percent a year. In the early 1980s, as lower commodity prices and rising interest rates squeezed producers, profits from farmland dropped and so did land values. Farm numbers declined again and consolidations increased. `` Farmers hurt most by the drought are offering land for sale or rent in sufficient numbers to slow the rise in land values that began last year, following six years of decline,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` This lowers the price of land relative to its value, leading to further consolidations by farmers with growth potential.'' But the drought is causing consolidation differently according to region. In winter wheat areas of the southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, yields were high this year, and with rising market prices `` the consolidation would be somewhat like that experienced in boom times, including a slowing in the rate of exit'' from farming, he said. `` But for farmers growing spring wheat in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, production was down by half, incomes were cut, and the consolidation would be more like that experienced during bust times,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. Urbanization, conversion to non-farm uses, rising transportation costs, and expenses associated with new technologies are some other factors that affect farmland consolidation. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said a number of factors are working against the tendency to farm consolidation, including: _ Selling off parcels of land for city growth can result in a larger number of small farms _ Non-farm incomes help ensure survival of smaller farm operations, including part-time and hobby farms _ Some farms that produce specialty commodities appear small by some measures but are proving profitable and durable _ Larger farms sometimes reach a size beyond which they can grow no more and may even break up into smaller farms Census information shows that large farms `` are just as likely to break into small ones as small farms are to blossom into large ones.''

 More than two-thirds of Americans surveyed want to see the rich pay more taxes, while an increasing number of people are growing disenchanted with the new tax law, according to a new poll. The sixth annual Money magazine survey on Americans and their money, released Wednesday, also found that many respondents expect the economy to run into problems in the coming months. But those surveyed do n't expect to see their own financial situations worsen. The survey, conducted last spring, was the first taken after taxpayers had their initial encounter with filing returns under the new tax law.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Tumble, Stocks Post Small Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil prices have slipped further to new two year lows, and takeover speculation has helped the stock market post a modest gain. Congressional investigators, meanwhile, report finding no widespread price gouging at grocery stores in the wake of the summer drought. In the oil futures market, reports of growing supplies and speculation about friction among key producers were cited for sending crude oil prices below $ 13 a barrel Wednesday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> dropped 47 cents to settle at $ 12.60 a barrel. The benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude traded as low as a $ 12.28 barrel during a hectic session. Over the past month, the near-term crude oil contract price has fallen $ 2.19 a barrel to the lowest level since August 1986. Prices for refined products traded on the exchange, such as wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil, also fell. Among the rumors sparking fears in the market was talk that <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> had decided to leave the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, and that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, considered a stabilizing force, would step down. Both rumors were denied, analysts said. Also contributing to the decline was an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report, released after the close of trading Tuesday, that showed a higher-than-expected increase in crude oil stocks and a sharp increase in refinery production. Stock prices were supported by takeover speculation, analysts said. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.45 points to 2,106.51 on Wednesday, while advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said pasta, cereal and white bread prices rose more between June and August than they did in the same period last year.

<HEAD>Irving Chairman Agrees To A Friendly Bank of NY Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest and most bitterly contested takeover battles is nearing an end, with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s top management accepting a sweetened $ 1.4 billion offer from rival <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement Wednesday came one day after <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> lost a key court battle on its anti-takeover `` poison pill'' defense. Irving Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said he would recommend the board of directors approve the merger and drop all pending lawsuits and anti-takeover defenses used to ward off <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s year-long advances He also promised to move up his retirement plans and leave after the deal was completed. A special board meeting was set for Friday, although many banking experts have called the vote a formality. `` We're 99 percent there. I believe the board will go along with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under the revised bid, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> would pay $ 15 in cash and 1.675 shares of its own stock for each of Irving's 18.9 million common shares outstanding. It also included warrants valued at $ 5 a share toward the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> stock. The entire deal would be worth about $ 76 a share, or around $ 1.4 billion, about $ 200 million higher than the hostile offer. The previous bid had the same amount of cash but slightly less stock and did not include the warrants. Irving shares jumped $ 3.75 to close at $ 73.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents to $ 34.12 -LCB-. Neither side would comment on the turn of events leading to the tentative pact. But banking analysts agreed <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> was forced to negotiate with its unwanted suitor after losing Tuesday's court rulings and in the absence of any friendly `` white knight'' takeover partner. The appellate division of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday struck down a key provision of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defense. The defense would have allowed all <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders except a hostile suitor to buy $ 400 worth of Irving shares for $ 200 if any suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock without the support of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s management. The plan was intended to make a hostile takeover bids prohibitively expensive. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> had vowed to appeal the ruling to the state's <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, but some legal experts questioned whether that court would have considered the case since the appellate division's decision was unanimous. `` The court ruling closed down one of their last possible escape routes,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They had very few options left.'' Last spring, Milan-based <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, offered to merge with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> as part of a major restructuring of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank. But it recently withdrew its bid after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ruled the Italian government agency that owned most of <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> had to supply separate financial imformation. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> already has given conditional approval for an Irving-Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> merger. A merger would nearly double <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s size, vaulting it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies. The two had a combined $ 47.8 billion in assets as of June 30. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 4.9 percent of Irving, had maintained since unveiling its takeover proposal on Sept. 25, 1987, that a merger would be a good fit because both banks have similar markets and services. While many analysts agreed, they also speculated <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> might have feared it would become a takeover target if a big <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> or foreign bank decided to enter the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s Ms. <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said she expected <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with the strategy it proposed at the start. That includes selling some of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s assets, reducing <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s Third World debt portfolio and consolidating facilities. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` One thing the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to do is reaffirm client relationships. `` They paid dearly for it -LRB- a merger -RRB- in both cost and disruption both companies have incurred,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said. According to the merger proposal, all present directors of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> would be invited to join <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, and all key personnel decisions would be made by a committee of directors made up of three directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and two current <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> directors. If <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board backs <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> also would drop its poison pill and waive a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state anti-takeover law that prevents an unfriendly merger for at least five years. When the bid was first made, it had the distinction of being the first hostile takeover fight between major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks. It then became the lengthiest such battle among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations.

 The marathon fight for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> appears headed toward a showdown next week in court. The publishing giant's board, as expected, urged shareholders Wednesday to reject a $ 2.51 billion tender offer from British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> previously agreed to a $ 2.5 billion buyout proposal from a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and including <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> senior management. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 25 cents a share to $ 88.62 -LCB- in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. That was slightly below <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer of $ 90.05 in cash and securities for each of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s 27.8 million shares <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s latest offer is $ 90.25 a share in cash. `` I do n't think the rejection makes much difference,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a media analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` A recommendation from the board ca n't stop an alternative bid.'' <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said `` the key issue now is in the courts.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s tender offer is set to expire Oct. 13, while <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer expires 24 hours later. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> already had filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, charging that the bidding process was unfairly skewed in favor of the management bid. A hearing on the complaint was scheduled for Monday. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said its board decided to recommend that shareholders reject <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s offer because it contained several conditions, including invalidation of the `` legal and binding contractual obligation'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> group. Early last week, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> gave both <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> a chance to make final offers for the company. At the time, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> was offering $ 86.80 a share in cash, while <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> had offered $ 85 a share in cash and securities. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> boosted his offer to $ 89 a share in cash. But <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> agreed to a subsequent <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 90.05 a share in cash and securities, and promised to sell the group four of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s businesses for $ 865 million should its merger not be concluded. They are the Berlitz language centers, the directory division, the direct marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> subsequently boosted his offer to $ 90.25 a share in cash, subject to, among other things, elimination of the agreement to sell the four businesses. As an alternative, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said he would pay $ 900 million for the four businesses that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> agreed to sell to <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> and to drop his tender offer. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said in court papers filed Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> had told <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> what <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s final bid had been, enabling <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> to top <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s bid and demand the `` lockup option'' on the four businesses. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> also said the sale of the four businesses had been structured in a way to discourage any bids for the remainder of the company by exposing <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> to a $ 250 million tax liability on the sale. A spokesman for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said the communication from <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> group was appropriate.

 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are raising national security issues in an attempt to get President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to block a $ 4.9 billion hostile takeover by a South African conglomerate. Gold Fields and <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>, the objects of an overture by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, said in a filing Wednesday that an acquisition by the South African interest would `` imperil <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to strategic and precious metals vital to national security.'' Gold Fields, which is based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, owns 49.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based company that is the largest gold producer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> last month offered $ 4.9 billion for the 71 percent stake it does not already own in Gold Fields. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, is controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he could not comment on the filing because <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials had not yet seen it The Defense Production Act, as amended by this year's trade bill, authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit any merger or acquisition by a foreign company that threatens to impair national security. Gold Fields and <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to immediately block the transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets pending completion of an investigation. Gold Fields controls 8 percent of the world's gold production. It also produces rutile and zircon, which are raw materials for metals used in military aircraft and submarines. The proposed acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> would be the largest purchase to date of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets by South African interests. Half of Gold Fields' assets are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The offer for Gold Fields has sparked a controversy even though <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> American and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> said they would relinquish control of <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to sell Gold Fields' South African interests.

<HEAD>Du Pont Ties Employee Pay To Department Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employees in the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s fibers business soon will have a stake in the department's earnings, under an experimental program linking part of their pay raises to their department's financial performance. The `` achievement sharing'' that takes effect Jan. 1 for about 14,000 workers is expected to give employees incentive to see that earnings continue to increase, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON>, who led the team that developed the plan, said Wednesday. There will be at least a three-year trial for the plan and it then could become a model for the entire company. <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said the fibers department, which makes nylon among other fibers, has had `` fairly flat performance.'' `` We need to continue to grow our earnings and it's key we keep our people involved and we're doing that by giving them a stake in it. We're making them value the business,'' <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said. The plan is unique because it does not freeze wages or ask for employee `` give-backs,'' as do some similar plans in the auto industry, according to <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON>. Chemical industry analysts say the plan is trend-setting, although <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> is not the first company to try the concept. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stober </PERSON>, a chemical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the plan was `` long overdue'' and could make employees feel they own part of the company. `` The work could improve. Not to say it's suffered in the past. But to tie -LRB- pay -RRB- certainly peaks interest,'' <PERSON> Stober </PERSON> said. He also said such plans can lead to employees becoming more efficient and finding cost-saving ways to do their jobs. `` Fibers is doing good, but it should be doing better and this is a way to improve it,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a managing director for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. For the first six months of 1988, sales in fibers were $ 2.8 billion, compared to $ 2.6 billion for the first six months of 1987. After tax operating income was $ 322 million for the first six months of this year and for the same period in 1987. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> will begin placing an increasing portion of each workers annual pay raise `` at risk,'' until 6 percent of each employee's salary is at risk. That could take from three to five years. During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive at least 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers business performance. Annual pay will be based on a target rate equalling what <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> would pay employees not covered by the experimental plan, and raises and promotions would be based on the target rate. The company will adjust actual pay each year based on the fibers business financial results. If the department achieves 150 percent of its profit goal, employees would get back the 6 percent of their pay that's at risk, plus a bonus of up to 12 percent of their salary, depending on the excess earnings, <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said. If the department achieves 80 percent of its profit goal, the payout would be 3 percent of the money at risk. If the department earns less than 80 percent of its profit goal, there would be no payout, meaning the employees would not get the 6 percent of their raises that had been placed at risk. The department has about 20,000 employees worldwide, most of whom will fall under the plan Jan. 1. The company must negotiate with about 6,000 union workers at plants in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> before those workers will partipate. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchens </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Seaford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nylon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a union representing about 1,670 employees, said the union probably would vote on the plan by the end of the month. But he said he did not know what impact the union's current wage dispute with the company would have on acceptance of the plan. Since March, the union twice has rejected the company's offer of a 1.9 percent raise and a $ 400 lump sum payment.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> is pinning hopes for a turnaround in a three-year sales slump on new vehicles to debut in each of the 1989 and 1990 model years. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> introduced its 1989 model line on Wednesday with General Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> saying the Japanese automaker is looking toward a restyled Maxima sedan and new 240SX to begin pulling the company out of the sales doldrums. In the spring, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce a new version of the 300ZX and a small minivan, called the Axxess, he said. `` Our immediate success is riding on these new models,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell to 660,652 cars and light trucks in the just-ended 1988 model year from 781,280 vehicles in the 1986 model year _ a 15.4 percent decline. `` Sales have not reached expectations for us or for others in the industry,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We can look to a lot of reasons for a flat performance, like currency, intensifying competition or even vacillating buyer moods. `` I'm optimistic about the future,'' he said. `` Right now, our market share hovers around 4 percent. I think we can build that share to more than 5 percent by the early 1990s, largely on the strength of the four new models we'll be bringing out in the next year.'' But the sales turnaround wo n't take place immediately if projections <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> cited Wednesday are accurate. He said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> to sell about 660,000 vehicles in the 1989 model year, which would continue the erosion of sales. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the low projections for 1989 stemmed from, among other things, limited availability of 240SX models, the arrival later this month of Maximas to dealer showrooms and the yen-dollar exchange rate. `` We also recognize we've got to build up our image,'' he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> also said Wednesday: _ <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, has the capacity for another assembly line, but that no decision has been made about whether to expand the plant or, if so, what vehicle would be produced there _ The joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, would produce a larger minivan than the Axxess The Nissan-Ford project is to begin production in 1991 for the 1992 model year. _ The Axxess will have dual rear sliding doors, instead of the conventional right side sliding door on other minivans `` The advantage -LRB- of the Axxess -RRB- is our product will have power, performance and handling,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> provided a record $ 7.45 billion in development assistance in 1987, up 32.3 percent from a year earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday.

It said that ratio was 0.31 percent, up 0.01 percentage points from 1986. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> was first, having given 1.1 percent of its gross national product in aid. Meanwhile, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said it had extended $ 3.9 billion in loans to developing nations in fiscal 1987, up 8 percent from a year earlier.

Stocks have been drifting all week while traders await the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Friday morning on the employment situation for September. Brokers say traders have been especially cautious because of expectations that the figures will show job growth at a rate faster than the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would like to see in its efforts to keep inflation from reviving. A good many analysts doubt that the employment figures, however they turn out, will end the market's recent period of lethargy.

 Pro-government newspapers Thursday denounced <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government for its `` short-sighted decision'' to slash <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s holdings in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and warned it will damage relations.

The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the oil-rich gulf state's London-based investment arm, has bought up 1.316 billion BP shares since the British government sold off its one-third stake in the oil giant last year <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> stands to lose nearly $ 680 million at current market prices if it cuts its BP holdings to the level the British are seeking. The radical Al-Rai Al-Aam daily newspaper said in an editorial: `` The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> decision will inevitably endanger political as well as trade relations between the two countries. `` Despite attempts by the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government to justify its uncordial and unjust decision, the British step will endanger British-Kuwaiti relations.''

 Speculation over burgeoning world oil supplies and unsubstantiated rumors about further rifts within <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> have helped push oil futures below the $ 13-a-barrel level. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> plunged 47 cents to settle at $ 12.60 a barrel Wednesday in heavy, hectic trading. Still, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude recovered from its intra-day low of $ 12.28 barrel. In early trading today, it was up another 22 cents at $ 12.82 a barrel. Crude futures prices have not been this low since August 1986. A month ago, the near-term <ORGANIZATION> WTI </ORGANIZATION> contract had settled at $ 14.79. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 1.67 cents to settle at 39.44 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.41 cent to 37.76 cents a gallon. Much of the day's selling was technical in nature, analysts said. Oil prices fell sharply on early rumors that <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> had decided to leave the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, known as a crafter of compromises, would step down. Prices recovered somewhat when the rumors were denied. <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investment at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said `` this market has become so rumor-sensitive that even if a story does n't sound credible, there is a violent reaction.'' <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> said at least some of the rumors were being instigated by floor traders seeking to benefit their own positions. He also said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was giving the market a dose of its own `` intensive shock therapy.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest exporter, has voiced threats that it will continue overproducing unless other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members abide by their production quotas. `` We're in a price war,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an assistant director at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Unless the Saudis change their policy, the only way oil prices will rise is through technical factors. `` There's no hope on the fundamental front,'' he said. Even before trading began, the market was poised for a selloff with the latest statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The report, which was released after the close of trading Tuesday, showed a higher-than-expected increase in crude oil stocks. The report also showed a sharp increase in refinery runs. `` It just scares people to see the refineries looking like they are going to increase the supply of refined products,'' <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said.

 The government said Thursday it will sell state-owned <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to the public in late November at a price to be disclosed later. It will be the first privatization since the selloff of the government's one-third stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, which coincided with the stock market crash last fall Analysts said they expect the sale to raise $ 3 billion. That $ 12 billion BP share sale was a flop with investors, and left underwriters holding large chunks of the stock. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> subsequently stepped in as a buyer, accumulating a 22 percent stake in the oil giant which the government this week ordered more than halved, saying such a large holding would conflict with the public interest. The government said it will hold a special share in British Steel for five years after the sale to prevent any single holding exceeding 15 percent. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has sold off billions of dollars of state-owned assets to the public to promote capitalism and wider share ownership. Past sales have included <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, and luxury automaker <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The initial British Steel prospectus and sale date will be announced Oct. 28, Trade and Industry Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. It will be the largest ever sale of shares in an industrial manufacturing company in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Up to 10 percent of the shares will be reserved for employees. British Steel, after years of steep losses under state control, is now one of the world's most profitable integrated steelmakers. It is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s second largest steel producer and the fourth biggest in the non-communist world. British Steel had pre-tax profit of $ 708 million in its fiscal 1987-1988 year. The company has shed 80,000 jobs since 1980, leaving it with 53,000 employees.

The <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals have said that they consider <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s fast-food chains, to be a prime candidate for a leveraged buyout. In such a buyout, the purchaser relies on borrowed money, secured by a target company's assets, to finance an acquisition. The loans are repaid out of cash flow and divestitures. After an initial delay in trading, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> opened at $ 26.50 a share, up $ 1.62 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> paid an average $ 19 a share for the 9.28 million <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> shares it purchased over a period of days in September. At the current offering price, the acquisition would cost the firm an additional $ 1.13 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he and his partners met with <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Salizzoni </PERSON> and other executives recently. While that meeting was `` quite cordial and reasonable,'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said, the conclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> board `` was that it did not wish to sell the company at that time to <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said he hoped that the much more specific terms _ such as price and financing _ spelled out in today's letter would give the <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> board reason to reconsider. If the board again rejected the overture, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said, the partnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly to shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> requested a response by Wednesday. Formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> reported profits of $ 47.2 million on revenue of $ 2.5 billion last year. The company's $ 850 million acquisition of the <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s chain in late 1987 is expected to boost revenues to the $ 3.5 billion mark this year. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s operates about 1,250 restaurants nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> also owns the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Canteen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which contracts food, vending and recreational services throughout the nation at places like stadiums and national parks. The company also owns <ORGANIZATION> Spartan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>, S.C. The unit operates more than 400 <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants and 200 <ORGANIZATION> Quincy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> houses, mostly in the southeastern part of the country. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, with a warchest estimated at about $ 700 million, typically takes large positions in companies and uses that clout to force management to sell the company or make changes that boost the stock price.

 Grain and soybean futures prices declined today in early trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by bearish crop estimates from an influential private analyst. Sparks Commodities' figures put the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.543 billion bushels, about 70 million more than the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> estimates last month, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a grains trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The corn crop estimate of 4.474 billion bushels, about 12 million more than <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate, also was considered bearish and sparked a flurry of selling in the corn pit, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. The six-to-10 day forecast calling for dry weather and ideal harvesting conditions in major growing regions, as well as follow-through selling from Wednesday's weak close added additional pressure to the market, he said. In early trading, wheat was 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.23 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 2 cents lower with December at $ 2.91 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with with December at $ 2.45 a bushel; and soybeans were 11 cents to 12 cents lower, with November at $ 8.11 a bushel. Cattle futures prices were mixed, hogs were mostly lower and frozen pork bellies were down in early trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle opened .02 cent lower to .12 cent higher, with December at 72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .18 cent higher, with October at 81.80 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .03 cent higher, with October at 40.02 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .02 cent to .28 cent lower, with February at 49.17 cents a pound.

 Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said today the next president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must find a solution to the problems plaguing the savings and loan industry or they `` could affect the entire <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. economy.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s comments, on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, came a day after the government's top thrift industry regulator raised the estimated price tag for cleaning up the industry from $ 31 billion to $ 45 billion or more. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, told his fellow senators that the issue transcends politics. `` The time has come to stop the political finger-pointing,'' he said. `` There is plenty of blame to go around. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, a number of state legislatures, federal regulators and industry management must all share some of the responsibility for the thrift industry's problems,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said `` We should not let politics affect our better judgment. The problems facing the thrift industry are serious. If unaddressed, they could affect the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy,'' he said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates federally chartered S & amp; Ls, argued for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise the ceiling on how much it can borrow to bail out ailing thrifts. Just three months ago, Wall had raised his estimate from $ 22 billion to $ 31 billion. Now, he says, the bailout cost is in the range of $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion. Some private analysts put the cost as high as $ 100 billion. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said today that more money, by itself, is not the answer. `` It's going to take time to come up with a responsible, workable solution, and, unfortunately, the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't have any left,'' the Republican leader said, urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s succesor and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sworn in next January to make finding a solution a top priority The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 29-22 on Wednesday to expand the board's borrowing limit from $ 10.8 billion in bonds to $ 15.8 billion. The move is opposed by the industry, which pays an assessment to retire the 30-year bonds. The panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be `` hard put'' to oppose an expansion of the bank board's borrowing limit, since last summe, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized $ 10.8 billion in borrowing over three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> pushed for a higher limit of $ 15 billion. The bank board already has issued $ 3.75 billion in bonds. The Banking Committee bill would permit the bank board to float the remaining amount as soon as needed rather than spreading it over the next two years. So far this year, the bank board has committed $ 20 billion to close or merge 122 troubled thrifts. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said his agency's resources could cover the newly estimated cost, but only by placing `` an exceedingly heavy burden'' on the industry. Thrift institutions currently pay more than twice as much as their competitors, commercial banks, for deposit insurance and <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said that differential would have to continue over 30 years if his agency did not get help. The head of the industry's largest trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said extending the differential for 30 years `` would be an intolerable burden.'' `` The special assessment has made the difference between profit and loss for 69 solvent savings institutions so far this year. In other words, in the process of removing 122 insolvents, -LRB- regulators -RRB- have been driving another 69 which are now healthy closer to becoming problem cases,'' league Chairman <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. Wall said taxpayers would not necessarily have to pay the bill for boosting the bank board's resources. He listed alternatives, without endorsing any, that included: requiring institutions to place 1 percent of their deposits into the S & amp; L insurance fund, borrowing from the insurance fund for commercial banks or from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, and charging borrowers a fee for mortgages provided by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended higher, near the day's best levels, Thursday, as trading activity continued at a relatively brisk pace for the second consecutive day. Dealers said the market repeated the pattern of Wednesday's performance, when modest buying by institutions was more than matched by aggressive short-covering by market makers Short-covering is the buying of shares to fulfill agreements to sell them. `` Market makers have been caught a little bit on the hop here and did n't have the stock to meet it,'' said one equity salesman. The Financial Times-Stock Exchane 100-share index rose 12.6 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1,838.9, just 2 points below its best level. Volume was 573 million shares, nearly matching Wednesday's relatively healthy 574.5 million shares Consumer-oriented issues were among the market's major gainers as players turned to stocks that had suffered recently due to worries that British interest rates could move yet higher in the near term. Such fears have eased somewhat, with some players cautiously hoping that interest rates might have peaked. Even should bank base lending rates go above their current 12 percent, many players anticipate a bit of a breathing space in the meantime. `` There's no fear at the moment of a sudden hike,'' in rates, a salesman said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will close the regional offices of its energy and mining subsidiary in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and consolidate those operations in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> by the end of the year. The consolidation and reduced overhead from the recently announced sales of the company's <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, refinery and its <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> should help the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> save at least $ 45 million a year, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. The consolidation at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters will add 400 jobs to the 550 that already exist in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, but the reorganization will eliminate about 400 jobs throughout the company, he said. `` It is clear that the expense of maintaining our regional offices can not be justified in today's volatile and depressed oil pricing environment,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` Thus, we are streamlining to maintain our position as a low-cost finder and producer of oil and gas. `` We're going to do everything we can to cushion the blow for those affected, including ample severance pay and out-placement services,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` While we will close offices in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, we will still be active participants in the energy business in both areas.'' <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> will maintain production offices in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> and the firm will continue to operate its minerals group from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. Operations of the firm's Canadian subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, will be unchanged. Since the 1986 oil price collapse that sent prices from $ 24 to $ 10 a barrel, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> has been affected by the nationwide trend in which the domestic oil and gas industry lost some 400,000 jobs, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` In response to the 1986 collapse, we have instituted various cost containment measures that, including this reorganization, will result in annual savings in excess of $ 267 million before tax,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. Union Pacific Resources now has 375 people in its <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office and 325 in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> also announced three executive appointments as part of the consolidation. On Jan. 1, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, now vice president-finance, becomes executive vice president and chief financial officer. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossert </PERSON>, vice president and regional manager-Denver, becomes vice president of production and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindahl </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, regional exploration manager-Houston, becomes vice president-exploration. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 183 million on sales of $ 1.4 billion last year.

 The British government's demand that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> cut in half its stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC has drawn fire from critics who fear it might discourage foreign investment in the already depressed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock market The government says it acted to defend the free market against a cartel, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, to which <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> belongs. British Petroleum is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest company, and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is its biggest shareholder. Representatives of big British brokerage firms charged that the action departs from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s commitment to letting the market alone. `` The government's whole free-market policy is showing itself to be either confused or shallow,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, director of energy research at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm Kitcat and <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON>. `` Perhaps a new wave of protectionism is coming in, government intervention in what had been a free and open market,'' he said. `` Uncertainty never helps investment,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, an economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` You might well see equity prices fall quite substantially. I think it's fair to say it's another nail in the coffin.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the Gulf state's London-based investment arm, was ordered on Tuesday to reduce its $ 5 billion stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> from 22 percent to 9.9 percent over the next year. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s holding likely would conflict with the public interest. Analysts said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> stood to lose nearly 400 million pounds -LRB- $ 676 million -RRB- in what would be one of the world's biggest divestitures. The <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> government said only that it was considering its options, but pro-government Kuwaiti newspapers urged retaliation. The order could chill relations between the two countries, and some analysts speculated that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would review all its British investments. One-fifth of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s estimated $ 80 billion in overseas holidings are in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, including a recently disclosed 5.1 stake in <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britan </LOCATION>'s largest commercial banks. Critics in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> called the decision inconsistent, hypocritical, punitive and ungrateful toward <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a long-time British ally. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> quoted one unidentified analyst as saying it smacked of a `` you ca n't trust the Arabs'' attitude. But Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> insisted the decision reaffirmed free-market beliefs, saying <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> `` is a member of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, one of the great cartels of the world. We will not be part of that cartel.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, on whose recommendation the government acted, expressed concerns that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> might try to boost its own oil earnings by forcing British Petroleum to pump less <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil or cut exploration and development. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> supported the decision, saying, `` the rules were properly applied, the argument was fair and the outcome correct.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a strong advocate of free-market policies, has presided over a capitalist revolution in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since taking office in 1979, selling off state-owned industries and encouraging public share-ownership. In addition, when the government reviews large acquisitions of British shares, it is usually with the aim of safeguarding competition. At the same time <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a history of retaining `` golden shares'' which guarantee ultimate control of companies it views as strategically vital. It also has limited foreign holdings to a total of 15 percent in other privatizations. But, `` there is a fundamental difference -LRB- in the British Petroleum case -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. In previous cases, `` those things were notified in advance, with the foreign investor knowing in advance what the terms and conditions were.'' It is common on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s takeover scene for British targets of foreign bidders to wage emotional campaigns to keep themselves British. The opposition Labor party also is always quick to raise national sentiments when attacking the government's free-market policies. What prompted outcry over the government's <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> decision was the fact that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> had made unsolicited, legally binding pledges not to increase its stake or to use it to `` further any other commercial or political interest of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.'' Also, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s purchase of the 1.316 billion shares had bailed the government out of an embarrassing situation last fall. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s intervention relieved the government from having to fulfill its potentially costly promise to buy back unsold <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> shares after its sale of its one-third stake in the oil giant coincided with the stock market crash and flopped, leaving underwriters holding large amounts of stock. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said the government has twice intervened against the free market in British Petroleum's case _ first by guaranteeing to buy back unsold shares, and now by its action against <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` Why privatize British Petroleum if it's of such strategic significance?'' he asked, noting that the government did n't retain a golden share or previously limit foreign holdings in British Petroleum. Many analysts also were shocked by the size of the reduction ordered, saying they had expected a cut to 15 percent, and by the deadline set for disposing of the shares. Unless the government extends the time period for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to sell the 700 million British Petroleum shares, the effect on the post-crash market will be `` quite serious,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` There is going to be a perception that maybe we've reached the zenith of the free market, certainly a perception by foreign investors that competition policy is by no means well-defined,'' he said. `` It will knock <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as a financial center,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> charged.

Eastern declined comment on the developments concerning both <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. `` Quite frankly, we're not commenting on either report.

The pilots union warned it would seek a court order to block any such deal, and the head of the machinists union suggested his union would do the same. The unions successfully blocked an attempt earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to transfer the shuttle operation from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to a new subsidiary. The unions appear to favor a sale of all of Eastern as a going concern to a friendly acquirer, while they are opposed to the sale or transfer of its assets such as the shuttle. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was approached a few weeks ago by representatives of the machinists union at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> about the possible sale of the carrier, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said today. Eastern lost $ 89.8 million in the second quarter of the year, and recently laid off around 3,000 employees.

<HEAD>Clients Not Deserting Drexel; Some Accuse Government of Unfair
Tactics</HEAD>

 Despite <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s battle over charges of securities fraud, clients are n't abandoning the Wall Street powerhouse that pioneered the $ 100 billion high-yield `` junk bond'' market. On the contrary, they're extolling the virtues of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and its employees, particularly the financier who largely created that market _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Some clients go so far as to accuse government prosecutors of witch-hunt tactics. The unabashed defense of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> _ even from clients the government claims were cheated _ suggests the 2-year-old crackdown on Wall Street corruption, heralded for bringing speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to justice, may now be creating a backlash. Certainly, the lines of distinction that separated the bad guys from the good are becoming blurred. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, once seen as arrogant, aggressive manipulators behind junk-bond financed takeover deals, are taking on underdog roles in the wake of the charges leveled Sept. 7 by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, the zealous loyalty <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is inspiring suggests most clients are little concerned with whether the firm or <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> may have technically violated securities laws. What counts more is the firm's extraordinary ability to finance projects from day care centers to toxic waste cleanups to employee buyouts of big companies. If results are the principal test of customer satisfaction on Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> passes with flying colors. `` I have nothing but accolades for those guys,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Subotnick </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, who recruited <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> four years ago to help the company refinance by issuing $ 1.3 billion in junk bonds, which at the time was the biggest such transaction in history. `` I must say to you that in 1984, they were head and shoulders above other firms with respect to their ability, pricing, and in the end, on execution,'' <PERSON> Subotnick </PERSON> said. `` Everything <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> promised to do and then some, they did.'' <PERSON> Subotnick </PERSON> said he was so impressed with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> he recently recommended the firm to another large company that wants to refinance. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, vice president for finance at <ORGANIZATION> Concurrent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> concern that has merged with <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a Drexel-financed deal, also expressed admiration. `` The financing was raised, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> did perform,'' he said. `` That's the ultimate proof of the pudding.'' Some clients are so passionate about their defense of the firm and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> that they see the legal struggle as the tip of a more profound fight, which pits a new breed of entrepreneur against an established economic order. In their view, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s visionary talents and financing power have aroused the wrath of rivals and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policymakers, who see high-yield bonds as a risky form of debt, and are intent on destroying the 42-year-old financier. `` He has n't yet actually been accused of culpability for the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> earthquake, or for Hurricane Gilbert, or even for the ` greenhouse effect' that as you know threatens terrestrial life as we know it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> client and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> friend. `` Otherwise there does not seem to be a lot that a frustrated bureaucracy, bent on a Salem-style witch hunt, has n't attempted to blame on this man.'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who appeared at a recent publishing conference sponsored by <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, declined to talk about the allegations against him or other aspects of the government investigation. But <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> suggested he's been treated harshly and his work is widely misunderstood. `` I think we probably have n't done a good job explaining,'' he said. `` But you know, sometimes something's a two-way street. You have to care, to want to understand, too.'' The high-yield bonds <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is credited with developing are debt securities that pay high interest, often issued by companies that can not get investment-grade status from major credit-rating agencies. Pilloried by critics as a weapon for funding hostile takeovers, the high-yield bond market has emerged as an important source of alternative long-term financing for hundreds of small and medium-sized companies. For its part, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to shed the image as a prime purveyor of high-yield bonds for hostile takeovers, and now promotes the idea that such securities serve more useful and productive purposes. A blitz of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> advertisements suggest its high-yield bonds finance only the most morally upright enterprises, such as <ORGANIZATION> Kinder-Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a network of day-care and pre-school learning centers; <ORGANIZATION> Hovnanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a housing developer; and <ORGANIZATION> Unimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a shipbuilder purchased by employees. The cover of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond unit 1988 annual report is an artist's rendition of typical smalltown U.S.A, replete with a hospital, shopping mall and school, built on a rolled-out carpet of high-yield bonds. For almost two years, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have been under intense scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, the result of a deal struck with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, a convicted insider trader, to turn state's evidence and identify others in his illegal acts. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> finally accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other employees of secretly scheming with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to violate a range of securities laws that centered on some of the biggest takeover deals of the decade. But the charges seemed based mostly on <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s claims and fell far short of speculation that dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees would be implicated. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office has yet to bring any charges, and there is talk that the grand jury investigation it is directing has been delayed. There also have been other indications that investigators have found it difficult to obtain conclusive evidence to support <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s revelations. Even before the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed its charges, investigators had come under attack from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and its supporters for leaking sensitive details of the probes to pressure the brokerage into settlement talks. Officials denied those allegations and continue to characterize their pursuit of Wall Street wrongdoers as an important part of the campaign against white-collar crime. Perhaps the most serious of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> are that it cheated two important clients, <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, in the midst of prominent takeover deals a few years ago. But if <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> believe they were victimized they have n't said so or moved to sue <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> on their own. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement supporting <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which is helping <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' management finance an acquisition of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> action would have no impact on that transaction. Other <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> clients in the midst of deals also have come to its defense. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, president, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shared </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he expected no adverse impact on his company's proposed public offering of stocks and debt securities. `` We continue to have the highest confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` We trust the current litigation will be resolved promptly and that these key financing mechanisms will continue to be widely available in the marketplace.''

 The stock market hovered in a narrow range today in another sluggish session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 0.18 to 2,106.33 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 684 up, 602 down and 563 unchanged. Stocks have been drifting all week while traders await the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Friday morning on the employment situation for September. Brokers say traders have been especially cautious because of expectations that the figures will show job growth at a rate faster than the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would like to see in its efforts to keep inflation from reviving. A good many analysts doubt that the employment figures, however they turn out, will end the market's recent period of lethargy.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> proposed Thursday to acquire foods giant <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.13 billion in a friendly deal but held out the possibility of launching a hostile tender offer if the bid is rebuffed. The proposal, which would pay $ 28 in cash for each of the 39.27 million <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> shares <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> does not already own, had been expected. The aggressive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm acknowledged two weeks ago that it had amassed a 19 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> and might seek to acquire the company, whose operations include the <ORGANIZATION> Denny </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant chain <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the board had received a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> and was reviewing the offer. But shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s stake was disclosed last month, the <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> board indicated intended to remain independent. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped $ 1.75 a share to $ 26.62 -LCB- in afternoon trading. In the letter, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said that while it considered the offering price to be `` full and fair,'' it was `` willing to consider offering more if -LRB- TW -RRB- can demonstrate sufficient business prospects to justify doing so.'' Wall Street analysts agreed the price was reasonable, but some have estimated that <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s break-up value might be as high as $ 34 a share. The <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals have said that they consider <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> to be a prime candidate for a leveraged buyout. In such a buyout, the purchaser relies on borrowed money, secured by a target company's assets, to finance an acquisition The loans are repaid out of cash flow and, occasionally, the sale of assets. In this case, however, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> hinted it would not completely dismember <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>, which also operates food services companies and a small chain of nursing homes. `` We would like to work with operating management to build and enhance the company's core food service and restaurant business,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said in its letter. The partnership, which made the bid through <ORGANIZATION> SWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, is going to be `` a major force to reckon with,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rixe </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm D.A. <ORGANIZATION> Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>. `` It's anybody's guess if someone else will surface,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> paid an average $ 19 a share for the 9.28 million <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> shares it purchased over a period of days in September. Roughly 7.2 million of those shares had belonged to billionaire takeover strategist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. After meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals late last month, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Salizzoni </PERSON>, said, `` In view of the bright operating prospects for the company, we believe that the shareholders will be served best by the company's remaining independent <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he hoped that the much more specific terms _ such as price and financing _ spelled out in Thursday's letter would give the <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> board reason to reconsider. If the board again rejected the overture, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said, the partnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly to shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> requested a response by Wednesday. Formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> reported profits of $ 47.2 million on revenue of $ 2.5 billion last year. The company's $ 850 million acquisition of the <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s chain in late 1987 is expected to boost revenues to the $ 3.5 billion mark this year. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> attributed its strong second-quarter performance to <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s better than expected showing Since the acquisition, <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> has trimmed staff and embarked on a program to remodel the 1,220-restaurant chain. Over the next five years, the company plans to expand the chain by 500 restaurants. `` They've been making claims that <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>'s has surpassed <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s as the No 3'' restaurant chain in the nation, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> also owns the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Canteen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which contracts food, vending and recreational services throughout the nation at places like stadiums and national parks <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said Canteen has more than 1,700 accounts and about $ 1.5 billion in annual sales. The company also owns <ORGANIZATION> Spartan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>, S.C. The unit operates more than 400 <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants and 200 <ORGANIZATION> Quincy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> houses, mostly in the southeastern part of the country. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, with a warchest estimated at about $ 700 million, typically takes large positions in companies and uses that clout to force management to sell the company or make changes that boost the stock price. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> recently emerged from a bitter proxy battle with <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that saw the partners narrowly lose their bid for four seats on the razor-blade maker's board of directors. Ultimately the two sides reached a settlement that included a stock buyback and a standstill agreement.

 A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected an unusual request by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to disqualify the judge presiding over the government's fraud case against the Wall Street firm. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said in a written ruling that the move by attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and other defendants in the case to remove <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> was premature. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> previously scheduled his own hearing for next Tuesday to hear arguments on the defense effort to remove him. The defense is seeking <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s removal on grounds his wife has an interest in a corporate transaction financed by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Defense attorneys had said in an extraordinary petition to the appeals court last week that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s involvement created an `` appearance of impropriety.'' They apparently feared that if <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> issued a favorable ruling to their clients a higher court might overturn it on appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which had sought <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> for the case when it sued <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 7 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, had challenged the defense effort to remove him in a filing with the appeals court Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said the connection between <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s wife and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was extremely remote and was not grounds for prejudice. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, its high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others have been accused by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> of violating a range of securities laws in alleged schemes with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned inside trader who has been cooperating in the government's investigation of Wall Street corruption The defendants have denied the accusations.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> and one of her predecessors offered sharply contrasting opinions Thursday on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lost its competitive edge in world trade. `` I'm not sure we're behind,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said at the third annual <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Labor-Management Relations. `` Right now, exports are up and the trade deficit is falling.'' But <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, labor secretary during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said that while some economic measures of competitiveness may not indicate a decline, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has fallen behind in productivity and real income levels. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in a speech to more than 300 business and academic officials, said the next president will have to define a clear set of goals before the country will again become competitive with other countries. `` We have a passive trade policy. They have an active trade policy,'' he said. `` The country with an active trade policy will win because they know where they want to get and how they're going to get there.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, in an interview and an upbeat speech to the group, disagreed and said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s present programs will get the job done. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, unlike <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and some other Western countries, does not have a centralized economy, so the government can not impose the goals that <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> suggested, Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The speakers at the conference agreed that more attention should be paid to improving management systems and the education and services provided to workers. Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said issues such as parental leave should be negotiated between unions and management, rather than imposed by the federal government. `` I'm saddened that they seem to want to push for federal legislation,'' she said. `` If there's federal legislation, then there's less incentive to negotiate.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKersie </PERSON>, an industrial relations professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said such issues give unions a wedge to organize industries where workers have so far not been interested. `` While unions have seen little recent organizing success, it appears that employees do not appear to be satisfied with the status quo,'' <PERSON> McKersie </PERSON> said. `` The workforce appears to have unsatisfied demands in areas such as pay equity, career development, day care, -LRB- and -RRB- maternity leave.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, now a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said productivity per worker, in and of itself, is not the reason the country has declined relative to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other economic powers. `` We're four times as productive as the Koreans. The problem is the wage differential is six to one,'' he said. `` So even if we're more productive, they can undercut us with lower wages. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will never be able to cut wages to the point where they are competitive with the Koreans and should not try to do so. Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said she views education as the key to keeping the workforce competitive. `` Simply put, we have to get serious, together, many of you in this room, about public education,'' she said. `` The fact is that the current pool of applicants for entry-level jobs lacks basic skills such as reading, writing, problem-solving and communication.''

 Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual funds rose $ 182 million in the latest week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise, to $ 267.15 billion in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $ 267.6 million drop in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. The funds' assets hit a record high $ 280.02 billion in the week ended Feb. 24.

<HEAD>Indictment Of Polk County Citrus Company To Be First Of Many</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fraud indictment of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus company is the first growing out of a 22-month nationwide investigation of illegal citrus practices involving hundreds of millions of dollars, federal officials said Thursday. `` It was the first indictment, but the investigation is not limited to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Knutter </PERSON>, supervisor of the the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> fraud group which is coordinating the probe. The lengthy probe, dubbed `` Operation Orange Squeeze,'' is an unprecedented investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the citrus industry in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and other citrus-producing states, officals said. A <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> citrus processor, its <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> parent company and two of its former presidents were indicted Tuesday, accused of conspiring to bilk the federal government in a customs rebate scam. <ORGANIZATION> Allsun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and two former <ORGANIZATION> Allsun </ORGANIZATION> executives, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Ormond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, were charged with mislabeling export products between 1983 and 1986 in order to collect $ 776,458 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs rebates. Authorities charge the defendants attempted to cheat the government by labeling almost 2 million gallons of citrus pulpwash as frozen concentrated orange juice in 36 export shipments. Pulpwash is the residual citrus product left after the primary juice claim those rebates for exporting pulpwash, an inferior citrus byproduct, authorities say. Trying to pass the pulpwash off as concentrated orange juice was a fraud, the indictment says. The defendants have so far declined to comment on charges listed in the indictment. Custom laws allow companies 99 percent refund of import duties if products made from imported merchandise are later exported. The rebate also is allowed if the export is produced from a domestic substitute of the same kind and quality as the duty-paid import. Officials say more charges are expected against other exporters. `` Pulpwash may be one of the more fraudulent activities, but we're not limiting the investigation to that,'' <PERSON> Knutter </PERSON> said. In order to track exports, he said, investigators have to trace shipping records and trucking reports involving a number of companies. `` This is just the start,'' said Customs agent <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>. `` We'll be busy for a while.'' <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said investigators discovered a number of citrus concentrate exporters involved in the practice of mislabeling pulpwash as concentrate to get the rebates. When asked if future cases involved as much as hundreds of millions of dollars, <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said, `` Overall, that would be a conservative estimate.'' Customs officials said the agency's findings could hurt the credibility of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus industry. `` Operation Orange Squeeze has exposed a situation that could have a devastating effect on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus industry,'' said Customs agent <PERSON> Bonni </PERSON> <PERSON> Tischler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` Following natural disasters like the freezes of recent years and the citrus canker infestations, the last thing the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange growers and processors need is a company defrauding the government in order to make a few extra dollars.'' Only about 3 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> industry involves citrus concentrate exporting, according to Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>, economic research director for the <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Processors legitimately sell pulpwash to beverage companies who use it to produce diluted citrus drinks. Revenue in the industry totaled more than $ 3 billion last season, he said. Of that amount, about $ 100 million comes from concentrate exports, according to <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>.

 The stock market struggled to a small gain Thursday as traders awaited a new signal on the pace of the economy.

 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> thinks you should change your oil. Not the 30-weight in your LeBaron, but the oil in your salad and your marinara sauce.

Now, <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> markets extra virgin olive oil, balsamic and <LOCATION> Chianti </LOCATION> vinegars and red table wine, all of it produced in the area around the estate, which is named after his father.

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in late September, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,032.5 billion in the week ended Sept. 26 from $ 3,037.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,851.3 billion from $ 3,856.9 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 784.9 billion from $ 784.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,030.7 billion, a 3.8 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,843.6 billion, up 5.7 percent, while M1 rose 5.6 percent to an average of $ 782.6 billion.

<HEAD>Kroger Lays Off 300 at Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it is laying off about 300 employees at its <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters as part of a corporate restructuring it is undertaking while fighting two takeover offers. Most of those being laid off have been notified and will have their last days on the job Friday, company spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. The layoffs `` basically cover everything from vice president to the secretary level,'' <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. About 500 employees will remain at <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest supermarket operator, said the layoffs and elimination of associated costs will save the company at least $ 13 million a year. `` There is nothing more difficult than terminating the jobs of so many dedicated and loyal employees. However, major expense reductions are critical to the successful implementation of our restructuring program,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> said. Company officials said all of the affected employees are being given `` separation packages'' that provide a maximum of six to nine months' salary and continuing health-and-life insurance coverage for up to one year. The packages also include pay for unused 1988 or 1989 vacation time, company-paid job placement assistance or up to $ 2,500 reimbursement for tuition expenses. <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichler </PERSON> had said last week that the layoffs, along with sales of some company stores, real estate and food-processing plants, would all be part of the restructuring. This week, the Maryland-based <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, offered <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> help in fighting off a takeover bid in a contest the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> started. The Hafts, who control <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company which last month began the bidding competition for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement Wednesday that some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance to help <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> fend off a threat from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> corporate takeover specialist. `` We would be interested in working with <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> management to enhance the restructuring program by providing additional equity,'' <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> executive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said in his one-line statement, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 4.6 billion, corporate restructuring plan. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>'s latest buyout offer is a $ 5.03 billion proposal made Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> publicly is still sticking to its commitment to restructure itself and remain independent, rather than be taken over. But industry analysts say the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offer appears more lucrative to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, which would prevent <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> management from simply shrugging off the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> offer. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> made his statement after learning rival <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> had increased its bid Tuesday for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The Hafts, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, opened the <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> bidding Sept. 19 with an unsolicited offer of $ 55 per share, or $ 4.32 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> have made no offer to increase their proposal. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, in the best deal to date, proposes paying $ 50 in cash, $ 11 in debentures and a continuing equity interest in the company valued at $ 3 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s 78.6 million shares _ a deal worth $ 64 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has offered in its restructuring program, which would require layoffs and sale of some company stores and food processing plants, to pay shareholders a $ 40 cash dividend, a debenture with a trading value of $ 8 and a `` stub'' share of stock that company officials say will trade at between $ 9 and $ 13 per share. Wall Street investors, however, estimate the stub's value at as low as $ 5 per share. If <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> were to turn to the Hafts for help, the family would not represent a friendly alternative, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON>, an analyst with <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> investment adviser <ORGANIZATION> Rotan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They are hardly white knights. They're more like gray knights,'' <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> said. This is not the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> have competed with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> for a takeover target. But in the past, companies have made deals with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> to be rescued from the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would be pretty funny to welcome the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> in with open arms,'' <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> said. `` Usually you welcome <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON>. This is a real switch-a-roo.'' At least four shareholders' lawsuits have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, contending that its restructuring plan would not be in the shareholders' best interests. The 105-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has 170,000 employees and 52,000 shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarkets and convenience stores.

<HEAD>Rumored Chinese Purchase, Common Market Plans For Exports Spark
Wheat Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rumored Chinese plan to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and talk that the Common Market plans to raise their wheat export prices triggered a rally in wheat futures prices Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Expectations that the Chinese may be in the market for wheat also supported wheat prices, analysts said. In other markets, corn prices advanced, soybeans declined, cattle prices were mostly higher, hog prices were mostly lower, frozen pork bellies slid, gold gained, silver was lower and oil prices dipped. Wheat prices hit new contract highs amid continued hope for a Chinese purchase and the rumors of the Common Market's plans, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Higher export prices of Common Market wheat `` would make theirs less competitive and ours more competitive,'' he said Rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought a million tons of corn sparked a buying wave in the corn pit, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Soybean prices were pressured by bearish crop estimates from influential private analyst <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Wheat settled 3 -RCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.32 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 4 -LCB- cents higher, with December at $ 2.98 a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to -LCB- cent higher, with December at $ 2.46 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 10 \ cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher, with November at $ 8.12 -RCB- a Cattle prices surged at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where traders bought on ideas that supplies will tighten up in the fourth quarter. They seemed to ignore near-term fundamentals of lackluster boxed beef sales and slow feed-yard trade _ both indications that demand is slight, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The hog market fell under the influence of lower cash hog prices, while pork bellies were pressured because of large stocks in storage, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. Cattle prices settled unchanged to .57 cent higher with October at 72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .43 cent higher, with October at 81.77 cents a pound; hogs were .38 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with October at 40.02 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .20 cent to .78 cent lower, with February at 48.67 cents a pound. Gold prices at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rallied on expectations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Department figures to be released Friday would show an improved job picture for September, said analyst <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> A slight stabilization in crude oil prices, which have plunged lately, also was considered slightly bullish, he said. Gold was $ 2.70 to $ 3.10 higher, with the contract for delivery in October at $ 403.80 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.5 cents lower, with October at $ 6.288 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices settled mostly lower after a rally on mostly technical factors earlier in the session at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> rose 6 cents to settle at $ 12.66 a barrel, but other contract months settled as much as 15 cents lower. The near-term contract had been up as much as 30 cents during the session. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .06 cent to settle at 39.50 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.52 cent to 37.24 cents a gallon. Other contract months finished lower.

<TEXT>
 The reported talks on <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> possibly selling its troubled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to rival <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bring two former bitter foes back together. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, are tenacious financiers who warred over control of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> three years ago. A lot has changed since then, for both men and for the wild world of the deregulated airline business. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> empire went on to acquire Eastern for $ 676 million after his <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> bid failed, apparently has decided that running an unwieldy and fractious airline company is too much trouble. He is believed to be looking to sell parts or all of Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been frought with labor difficulty and staggering losses before and since <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took over. For <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, a well-known takeover strategist who has chased mammoth-sized companies ranging from <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the past few years, the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would make his the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline in terms of revenue passenger miles, an industry measurement of capacity. According to figures of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> trade group, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s combined capacity last year totaled 68.9 billion revenue passenger miles. The leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline last year in capacity was <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, with 66.2 billion revenue passenger miles. Eastern's militant workers, who have persistently characterized <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as a union buster, have been included in talks with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> on the possible sale of the airline to him, sources familiar with the situation said Thursday. In an ironic twist, that recalls the move by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s workers in 1985 to talk with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> about possibly buying that airline, which <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was seeking in order to strengthen the operations of his other carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and machinists promised <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> hundreds of millions of dollars in labor concessions if he took control, largely because they feared <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would gut <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and replace them with lower-paid workers, a strategy <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had used at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> earlier. After a seesaw struggle that lasted for several months, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> acquired a controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> as part of a broader arrangement to eventually take the airline private, which is expected to be completed soon. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> got about $ 50 million for selling its interest in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. Since the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> takeover, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has faced his own labor problems, beginning with a bitter strike by flight attendants in 1986 that left thousands out of work, replaced by new hires at lower pay. Although the strike failed, the flight attendants union has continued to challenge <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportion </ORGANIZATION> to review his fitness to run the airline earlier this year. More recently, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has incurred the wrath of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, who claim he broke promises to them when he initially acquired control of the airline. The pilots have sued him on grounds he is borrowing against the airline's properties without making crucial long-term investments in equipment. `` The solvency of the airline is in question,'' <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilots union chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashwood </PERSON> said in announcing the lawsuit last month. `` We wo n't stand idly by while <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> strips our airline of assets and keeps it from growing financially stronger, from buying airplanes and from improving service to our passengers because of heavy debt.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has denied the charges of both unions, saying he was `` dismayed'' by their actions.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises in Quiet Trading; Gold Continues Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar moved narrowly higher Thursday as traders awaited Friday's release of unemployment figures for September. Gold prices also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 403.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up from $ 400.30 late Wednesday. Dollar trading was very quiet, but some investors adjusted their positions in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s unemployment report, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders were waiting in particular to see what changes there would be in non-farm payroll statistics to be issued with the jobless report, <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON> said The market expected the non-farm payroll to have increased by about 300,000 to 330,000 workers last month, analysts said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar likely would slip if the payroll number fell short of expectations. Traders would interpret an increase in the non-farm payroll as a sign of economic strength. Traders believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is more likely to rein in credit _ moving interest rates higher _ when the economy is robust. The dollar tends to rise along with interest rates. Once the unemployment report has been digested, the market will look forward to next week's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit figures, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. Overseas trading in the dollar also was slow Thursday in anticipation of Friday's jobless figures. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar slipped 0.18 yen to close at 133.30 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.45 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 133.645 yen from late Wednesday's 133.38. The dollar edged upward against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6935 to buy one pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, cheaper than $ 1.6955 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound was quoted at $ 1.6927, compared with late Wednesday's $ 1.69385. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.86585 West German marks, up from 1.86475; 1.5847 Swiss francs, up from 1.5826; 6.3570 French francs, up from 6.3440; 1,391.75 Italian lire, up from 1,3900.00; and 1.20995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.20945. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8641 West German marks, up from 1.8625; 1.5830 Swiss francs, down from 1.5865; 6.3475 French francs, down from 6.3540; 2.1000 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1020; 1,388.75 Italian lire, down from 1,390.475; and 1.2116 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2075. Gold prices closed above $ 400 overseas, catching up to bullion's performance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday Gold jumped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 403.35 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 396.00, and it rose in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to a bid $ 403.90, compared with $ 395.40 late Wednesday.

 Union workers at <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reportedly would get their first general pay increases since 1981, as well as boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security under terms of a tentative contract agreement. The contract proposal between <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> calls for an average pay raise of 44 cents per hour in the first year of the proposed three-year contract, according to Thursday's edition of the Journal Star of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> Currently, the 13,500 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers at Deere earn an average $ 15.47 per hour, or $ 32,177 per year based on a 40-hour week. The newspaper, citing unidentified sources within the company and the union, reported that <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> workers would receive bonuses of approximately 3 percent, paid in lump sums, in each of the next two years of the contract. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>'s union work force has not received a general pay raise since 1981. It has given cost-of-living increases using a formula tied to the consumer price index. Besides wage hikes, the union won a three-step increase in early retirement benefits, the paper reported. In the contract's first year, the monthly pension benefit for those on early retirement would jump from $ 1,205 to $ 1,400. The monthly benefit would reach $ 1,500 in the second year and $ 1,600 in the final year of the pact. The union also claimed significant gains in the contract's job security plan. The proposed contract would guarantee jobs for all workers employed at the time the pact is ratified. The company would only be able to lay off protected employees in times of high inventories, labor disputes, plant closings, sale of a division of the company or `` an act of God.'' Ratification votes are scheduled this weekend at Deere factories and parts warehouses in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The tentative agreement capped a marathon 20-hour bargaining session. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> negotiated daily for nearly two months before the settlement was announced at 5:08 a.m. Saturday, more than five hours after the current labor contract expired. The new contract would take effect immediately upon ratification and would run through midnight Sept. 30, 1991. If the contract is ratified, <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and the union will have avoided a repeat of the bitter five-month strike in 1986-87 that ended after 163 days with employees' acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions. The union hopes to rekindle contract negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> immediately upon ratification of the Deere contract. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> has been meeting with the Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> for two months at a site in <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday entered a not guilty plea and asked for a jury trial on criminal negligence charges in the Jan. 2 tank collapse that fouled two major rivers with diesel fuel A spokesman for the Kentucky-based company, which publicly admitted errors that figured in the collapse, declined to say whether <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> attorneys are attempting to negotiate a bargain with prosecutors. `` We're having conversations with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney. We're still interested in doing that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>. A federal grand jury on Sept. 15 returned a two-count indictment accusing <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> of violating the Clean Water Act and the 1899 Refuse Act. Prosecutors say neither law requires the government to prove the pollution was intentional. If convicted on both counts, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> could be fined $ 400,000 plus double the damage caused by the spill. The spill occurred when a steel tank at the company's <LOCATION> Floreffe </LOCATION> terminal burst as it was being filled for the first time since the World War II-era structure was dismantled near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and reassembled south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. An independent study blamed the collapse on a dime-size flaw near one of the welds used in reassembling the tank. Besides failing to obtain all the necessary local permits to erect the tank, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> admitted violating industry standards by not filling the vessel with water to test its strength. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said Jan. 27 that employees responsible for moving the tank were told more than a year earlier about faulty welds in the vessel walls. A memo describing the faults was n't uncovered by senior management until nearly three weeks after the tank collapsed, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> maintains it is unfairly being prosecuted. `` We've spent $ 13 million in reimbursements and cleanup costs,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. `` We do n't feel that any of our conduct justifies a criminal penalty.'' An estimated 3.8 million gallons of oil gushed from the tank as it crumpled.

 The formidable price tags on 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> automobiles will rise a modest 1.7 percent over 1988, and the company is testing a new used-car warranty program, officials said Thursday. Prices for the West German-made luxury cars will range from $ 30,980 for the 190 diesel sedan, to $ 79,840 for the two-door 560SEC. The best-selling car in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escort </ORGANIZATION>, with a base price of about $ 7,500, less than a tenth of the 560SEC's sticker. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't expect any price fluctuations in 1989 because of the exchange rate between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and the West German mark. He said he was happy with the company's sales performance despite slipping a little from last year's level of about 80,000 cars. He said during the past year, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> had restructured itself and it's paying off. The luxury car market, of which Mercedes holds a significant share, will continue to grow, <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said, and competition in it will increase as <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> introduce their Lexus and Infiniti lines next year. `` The overall luxury market, there is a lot of steam in there,'' <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> added. But along with holding its volume of new car sales about the same level, Mercedes is looking at improving its used-car operations through a pilot warranty program in 20 dealerships nationwide. `` We want to test how it works on the dealer level, customers and our own administration,'' <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said. For cars less than 8 years old and with less than 100,000 miles, the program would offer a 12-month, bumper-to-bumper warranty. The program started a few weeks ago and will be assessed in December, <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said. Dealers would set the cost of the warranty. Officials said about 60 percent of the new Mercedes sold are bought by former Mercedes owners. The cars retain 65 to 70 percent of their original value in two years and 40 percent to 45 percent after five years, they added. All of the new'89 Mercedes will be equipped with anti-lock brake systems and driver-side air bags. Some cars will have passenger-side air bags as standard equipment. The average new Mercedes buyer is 40 to 43 years old and comes from a household with an income of about $ 100,000 annually, <PERSON> Krampe </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court has upheld a proxy vote electing new R.P. <ORGANIZATION> Scherer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> board members backed by dissident shareholders who want to sell the gelatin capsule company, <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> attorneys were reviewing the ruling received late Wednesday, and had not decided whether to appeal, company spokeswoman <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON> said. The decision was hailed by <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, both children of the company's late founder and members of the board of directors, who lead the shareholder group pressing for the sale of the company. `` Yesterday's decision in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> is the latest in a series of victories for R.P. <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> stockholders, who now are several steps closer than they were a week ago to maximizing their investments through sale of the corporation,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said in a news release.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has failed to act against tens of thousands of violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act by local water systems, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` There has been a major breakdown'' in administration of the 1974 law, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, executive vice president of the federation, at a news conference. The federation, whose 5 million members make it the nation's largest environmental organization, released a report of an 18-month examination of 15,000 pages of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> computer printouts for the 1987 fiscal year that showed 36,763 water systems committing 101,588 violations of the act The nation has over 200,000 water systems. Though the law requires that every violation be reported to customers of the system, only 5,867 notices were issued. The federation did not count failure to issue notices in its survey of violations. If it had, they would have numbered 197,309. Of the violations, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, federation staff lawyer and principal author of the report, 17,506 were violations of enforceable contaminant standards and the rest were monitoring and reporting violations which both he and the agency consider potentially more serious. Monitoring and reporting requirements are `` the heart of the law,'' the study said. `` They enable the identification and correction of public health risks before they blossom into crises.'' Seventy percent of the contaminant violations were for exceeding bacteriological standards, 20 percent involved inorganic chemicals or substances like metals or arsenic, 0.6 percent were organic chemicals such as pesticides, 0.9 percent were radioactivity violations, and 7.7 percent were turbidity _ sediment _ violations, according to <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s figures. `` There's no excuse for a public water system to be distributing water that exceeds the bacteriological standards,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, since bacteria are easily killed by cheap, well-understood chlorination. The law permits states to run drinking water protection programs approved by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> if their standards and procedures are as tough as the federal standards. Only <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have opted to leave <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> with direct authority in those jurisdictions. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said a 1982 report on lax enforcement by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> led </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to remove enforcement discretion from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, changing the statute to read that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` shall'' take enforcement action against every violation if the state does not do so in 30 days. Before, the law read that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` may'' act. But what action is needed is left to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. The maximum penalty is a fine of $ 25,000 a day for each violation, rarely imposed. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` All regulatory agencies must have enforcement discretion.'' When <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> finds a violation, `` It is our position that it need not be an enforcement action'' that follows. `` It's important to understand that if enforcement actions are not taken, the states are aggressive in protecting the public health'' through `` boil water'' announcements, requirements for provision of bottled water and similar measures, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Small systems _ almost two-thirds of the total serve fewer than 500 people _ may have difficulty raising money, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` It may take some time for this community to float a loan'' to upgrade treatment systems. `` You're talking about years. It does n't make a lot of sense, if you have a cooperative community which is moving ahead, to beat them over the head with penalties that they ca n't afford anyway. <PERSON> Hair </PERSON> said `` there is no question discretion must be used,'' but the agency must do something. `` For a first-time violator and a minor violation,'' no fine would be appropriate, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` A simple compliance order and a public admonishment'' would suffice. `` We're not talking about calibrating the enforcement dial a little bit,'' said Hair. `` We're talking about tens of thousands of violations.'' <PERSON> Hair </PERSON> said the federation made no attempt to assess health risks to the public from the violations, but he and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had estimated that 110,000 illnesses arose in the population between 1971 and 1985 from waterborne disease, and some experts believe there may actually have been 25 times as many cases. People worried about their water may get it tested by a private lab, but a full rundown on organic and inorganic chemicals can cost more than $ 200, `` more than the average person should be asked to do,'' <PERSON> Hair </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> established a toll-free telephone number 15 months ago to answer question about drinking water -LRB- 800-426-4791, -RRB- and <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, the contractor operating it, said calls now run about 200 a day. About half come from local and state government agencies and water systems seeking information and half from the general public. Of the public callers, he estimated three quarters were worried about water quality and a quarter were people saying, `` We're overregulated and our water bills are too high. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the trade association of private and publicly operated water supply systems, deputy executive director <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he did not doubt the federation's figures, and also did not doubt that many violations that should have been punished were not. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s comment that many systems were financially strapped. `` We're going to have to say to some of these smaller systems, ` You're going to have to have financial capability, or we're going to force you into a regional system,''' something the state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> is doing, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pan Am Transport Workers Vote for Arbitration in Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of the largest union at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have voted to submit their contract dispute with the financially pressed airline to binding federal arbitration, union officials said Thursday. In August, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> membership rejected a new cost-cutting contract that had been agreed to by its leadership and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. The airline has already accepted arbitration in talks with the Transport Workers. The union represents about 5,900 mechanics, aircraft service personnel and flight dispatchers at New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth-largest airline. Details of the vote were n't immediately available. In announcing the vote, <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> officials said the union will now sit down with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> management to set up the ground rules for the procedure and choose an arbitration panel. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> reached a tentative contract agreement with leaders of its flight attendants union. Details of the new flight attendants' contract, which must be ratified by the union's membership, were not disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the contract provides for cost reductions similar to those agreed on earlier this year with the two unions representing pilots and flight engineers at the airline. The new agreement provides for labor concessions by the 4,500 flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, according o a source close to the negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking around $ 90 million in wage reductions from its flight attendants. The ratification vote is expected to be completed in mid-November. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 88.4 million in the first half of the year, believes it needs about $ 540 million over three years in pay cuts and other concessions to turn itself around. The contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> would have saved the airline about $ 81 million over the next three years, according to both the union and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. The airline has imposed $ 35 million in cuts on employees represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union under federal labor rules. The unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed to cuts totaling about $ 240 million over three years.

The employees contend the dues deductions will force them to finance political campaigns, ideological causes and other non-collective bargaining activities they oppose, the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, Va.-based foundation said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Beginning Oct. 13, non-members will be required to pay so-called agency fees nearly equal to union dues, the statement said. `` This new ` agency shop' scheme is nothing more than an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> officials to replenish their political coffers and advance their agenda with the wages of state workers who want nothing to do with that agenda,'' <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the foundation's executive vice president, said in a separate statement. `` And the state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is a willing accomplice and must be held accountable.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> said from <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that a Grand Rapids attorney was reviewing the suit on the union's behalf `` But we have n't seen any paperwork back here,'' <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> said. `` Until we see the actual charge, we have no comment at this time.'' Besides the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and Local 6000, defendants include state Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Director </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> and personnel directors of state government agencies.

<HEAD>Report: Mexico To Protest OPEC Overproduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> plans to file an `` energetic protest'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> over the failure of some cartel members to stay within their production quotas, according to a report here. The government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday blamed <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction for the glut on world markets that caused petroleum prices to reach a two-year low this week. Oil prices also have been depressed by speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction would continue in the near-future, due to disagreements among cartel members over output quotas. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, does not belong to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> but closely monitors the 13-member cartel's pricing and production policies. The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted an official with the Energy, Mines and <ORGANIZATION> State-Owned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as saying the government planned `` an energetic protest against <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members for the lack of seriousness and responsibility in meeting their fixed production platforms.'' The department oversees <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>'s operations. Excelsior quoted the department official as saying <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had lost $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue so far in 1988 because of depressed market prices. A department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to confirm the Excelsior report but said the government soon would decide what action, if any, it would take towards <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotomayor </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would maintain its oil exports at current levels to generate necessary revenue and avoid government cuts in social spending. Citing <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Tuesday announced it had cut the price of its light crude exports to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> from $ 13.50 to $ 11.80 a barrel. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> produces about 2.5 million barrels of crude a day and exports 1.35 million barrels a day _ about half of that to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>. First quarter oil exports accounted for $ 1.8 billion in revenue, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Crude exports generated $ 7.9 billion in all of 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is calling on its investors to submit by Monday any plans they may have for reorganizing the financially troubled consumer products company. Among those interested in controlling the company is <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON>, president and chief executive of the shaver manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Remington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON>, who has a stake in the company, is reviewing confidential financial information, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Management said it also held talks with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> multimillionaire <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, who first offered more than two years ago to take over the company. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has been operating under protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy code since February. The company's management is willing to step aside if required under an acceptable reorganization plan, although a successful plan might keep the current management in place, said company spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romonoff </PERSON>. A stockholders plan filed within the last week calls for stockholders to keep 50 percent of the reorganized company and to receive rights to buy another 30 percent for $ 30 million. The plan would give an outside investor, such as <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON>, rights to the rest of the company for $ 20 million. The management team under Chairman <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> would be replaced. The shareholders' plan would pay creditors between 50 percent and full value for their claims. Management's reorganization plan has been criticized by every major creditor group. It calls for bankers and creditors of <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary to be repaid in full, while other creditors would get 60 cents to 85 cents on the dollar, and shareholders interests would be diluted by 75 percent. Allegheny management has the exclusive right to submit a reorganization plan through Oct. 27, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> last month said he would accept plan outlines from committess representing shareholders, unsecured creditors and <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> sent letters to four former officers, including former Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, calling in low-interest loans of more than $ 4.3 million made to them in the early 1980s. The company said the loans would be due in full Oct. 22 unless the men begin making payments. All four claim in separate complaints filed with the court that they should not have to repay the money until <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> restores benefits taken away by the board in March 1987.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday seized one of the most popular issues of the presidential campaign and, on a 94-0 vote, approved a tax exemption for interest on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds that are used to finance a college education. Wading into two even bigger issues _ taxes and drugs _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the time being refused to raise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol to help pay for a $ 2.6 billion bipartisan anti-drug bill. A 60-33 vote killed the amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, that would have raised the 16-cent cigarette tax by two cents and added five cents to the price of a six-pack of beer or bottle of wine and 30 cents to a fifth of liquor. The amendment is likely to come up again next week when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considers the big drug measure itself. `` I know the president of my party and the presidential nominee of my party are against new taxes, and I am pretty much against new taxes,'' said <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>. `` But are we going to let this problem get away from us?'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., manager of the tax bill, said the entire bill would have been killed if <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>'s amendment had been adopted `` The White House believes this is not the way to raise money to fight the war on drugs,'' he said. The lawmakers made quick work of another hot question, killing on a 56-39 vote an effort by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, that would have repealed tax exemptions of abortion clinics. The action came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> worked on a bill whose main purpose is to correct errors and misunderstandings in the 1986 tax overhaul. The measure also includes some tax breaks worth about $ 2.7 billion over three years and the tax increases to pay for them. A larger bill, with a $ 7.5 billion price tag, has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and there is no assurance a compromise can be agreed on by both chambers before adjournment. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill has benefits for farmers and other off-road users of diesel fuel, first-time homebuyers, corporate research efforts and workers who receive educational or legal assistance from employers. The measure includes a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, offered the savings-bond amendment He introduced it last year and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> included it in his budget earlier this year. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> described his savings-bond proposal, which is not in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, as `` a simple, sensible way ram.'' Under the provision, the interest on any savings bond used to pay for costs of a college or vocational education would be tax-exempt. All savings bonds already are tax-deferred until redeemed; in addition, they are exempt from state and local taxes. Thr would simply not report that interest as taxable income. The full exemption from federal tax would be available to familieswhose adjusted gross incomes are under $ 60,000 a year. The benefit would be reduced gradually as income rises: between $ 60,000 and $ 70,000, 67 percent of the interest would be exempt; between $ 70,000 and $ 79,999, 34 percent would be exempt. Once income reaches $ 80,000, no bond interest would be allowed. Those figures would be adjusted each year to reflect inflation. The education benefit would be paid for by limiting the personal tax exemption allowed full-time students 24 years or older who are still claimed as dependents by their parents. Under <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s proposal, the parents could take the exemption only if they provide at least half the support of the student and the student has income of less than $ 1,950 <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s proposal is similar to one advocated by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee for president. The Democratic candidate, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, has offered a new loan program that students would pay back through payroll deductions after they complete their education. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his plan is simple, risk-free for investors, good for the nation's savings rate and convenient. `` But ultimately, I believe that the most important feature of this proposal is simply that it sends a loud, clear message about our priorities,'' he said. Not voting on the savings bond interest exemption were Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb.; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S.; and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal appeals court Thursday to order a judge to hear its claim that an investor group was improperly pursuing a $ 2.66 billion takeover attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> maintains the hostile buyout attempt by a group led by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> brothers violates <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations by being too highly leveraged. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hungate </PERSON> has issued a stay barring litigation in the case, making it impossible for <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> to seek a judgment in the matter. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> asked a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in an expedited appeal to order <PERSON> Hungate </PERSON> to hear its claim. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, has rebuffed the group's overtures since it first offered $ 64 a share in July. On Sept. 20, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> announced its board of directors had rejected a revised, conditional $ 72-a-share offer and had instead adopted a major restructuring and recapitalization program that might include the sale of some of its major businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Saligman </PERSON> said the restructuring plan was worth $ 76 a share. The company is a a diversified manufacturer of furniture and apparel whose lines include <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> furniture, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog outerwear and <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> shoes. Cardinal Acquisition, the group led by brothers <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON>, has acquired about 8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> stock in a tender offer that expires Oct. 11. The group is pursuing a leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>. In such a deal, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with money raised through the company's cash flow or by the sale of its assets. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> contends the amount of money <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> would have to borrow is greater than limits set by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Cardinal Acquisition argued before the appeals court that the matter should be settled in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts _ <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ and noted a federal judge there had refused to block the takeover attempt. Attorneys said every effort <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> has taken to block the takeover until now had been taken in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said <PERSON> Hungate </PERSON> had refused to hear the question because there were other avenues open, but contended none of the alternatives showed a likelihood for success in time and others were unfeasible. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said the appeals panel court would issue an order `` as soon as we can.'' The hearing was held in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because all judges of the 8th Circuit were here for to discuss internal court matters.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Thursday appealed a federal judge's ruling that the government could not force ailing <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to reassume some $ 3 billion in pension obligations. The <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency which insures pensions for some 40 million workers, filed the appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The appeal seeks to overturn `` as a dangerous precedent'' a ruling last June by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> could not make <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> reassume the pension obligations simply because <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> had signed new contracts restoring previously cut health and welfare benefits. `` The appeals court must decide whether federal insurance should protect retirees or provide corporate welfare to profitable companies,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Utgoff </PERSON>, the agency's executive director. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> terminated three pension plans covering some 100,000 workers and retirees of its steel subsidiary after the company filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 1986, listing some $ 6 billion in liabilities. The biggest of the liabilities _ $ 3 billion _ were the pension plans, which then had assets of just $ 1 billion to cover benefits for some 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> workers and retirees. When <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> terminated the pension plans, the federal agency became <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s single biggest creditor, assuming responsibility for the $ 2 billion in uncovered pension liabilities. However, the agency does not insure related health and welfare retirement benefits promised by <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> to its workers. When <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> signed new contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> unions restoring those benefits last year, the agency tried to turn the pension plans back over to the company, saying <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> was taking unfair advantage of the federal insurance program to cut costs and buy labor peace. Sweet ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> had shown `` no factual or legal basis'' that the company had abused the pension insurance program, but said he was willing to reconsider the issue with some additional `` fact finding'' by the agency. <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Thursday that the agency chose to appeal Sweet's ruling to a higher court rather than seek a new hearing based on the additional fact finding.
