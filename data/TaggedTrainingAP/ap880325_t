 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, far ahead of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, said Friday he will stick to his game plan in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> campaign and declared, `` It's too early for me to start thinking about any running mates.'' With the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tally showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 788 delegates to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 178, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was downbeat as he told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side.'' The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator, telling reporters, `` I can read the numbers and I know probably what's going to happen,'' suggested he was re-evaluating his campaign, but his spokesman said the candidate is n't ready to abandon the race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't see any reason to change any game plan that we have.'' The vice president added: `` This does n't say it's over. So I'm going to just keep going right down to the wire and not speculate on somebody else's campaign or on the Democratic side.'' Asked whether he would consider <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It's too early for me to start thinking about any running mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I do n't want to do.'' He commented after addressing an estimated 1,000 supporters who went to a fieldhouse to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his family and have a lunch of chili, crackers, brownies, iced tea and lemonade. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was asked on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'' if he would accept the vice presidency if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned to him. `` It's not just going to happen. That is n't going to occur,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs to find someone who will bring strength to the ticket on a regional and political basis, and I think that is not going to be me.'' He mentioned former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> as good choices for the vice presidential slot. Despite this, when pressed as to whether he would refuse the position if it was offered, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` I did n't say that. Nobody says that who spent 20 years in politics. `` You know, most of my adult life I've spent in public service, and if someone asked me to do it, I would have a very difficult time trying to figure out what I was going to say,'' he said. `` But I do not wish that to happen. I do not think that will happen, and I do not expect it.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived at the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> where he spoke briefly to about 300 people before flying to <ORGANIZATION> Buckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> and going by motorcade to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in a search for support in the state's April 4 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees will represent the `` difference between night and day,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the university. `` The country does not want to swing left to that Democratic gloom-and-doom liberal philosophy, and we're not going to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he is unsure whether the cease-fire agreement in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will work. `` I am skeptical,'' he said. `` I hope it works. I hope peace can come and with it, democracy and freedom. Those two have to be together.'' `` You ca n't have a peace that ends up with the Soviets ending up with a base in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are not as supportive of our initiatives with the Contras as I'd like to think the facts dictate. But they are strongly supportive of the concept, overwhelming so, that the Soviets should not have another stronghold in this hemisphere,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged strong support for the Strategic Defense Initiative or `` Star Wars'' space defense program, which is being developed in that city. `` Is n't it better to put weapons at risk rather than human lives at risk?'' he asked. `` We can do it technologically.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also brushed aside questions involving the Iran-Contra affair and what impact it would have on his political future, saying Americans are not concerned about that issue. `` The Democrats are short of real issues, bringing it up over and over again. No one is even suggesting I have done anything wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The top American representative at <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>'s Expo'88 will be one of the few Americans who can claim to be a specialist in both world's fairs and in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON> is preparing to travel Down Under to play his new role of commissioner general of the American pavilion, with the rank of ambassador. `` I have a background of half a dozen years in world's fairs, which is really very unusual, because it's not what you might call a regular profession,'' the veteran radio and television entertainer said at a news conference Thursday. A half century ago, he said, he left a comfortable job at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> radio station to spend `` a very happy seven or eight months'' organizing radio events at the San Diego-Pacific International Exposition. That led to a similar job at the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Centennial in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and finally to more than two years at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair on the eve of World War II. <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON> started acquiring his Australian expertise with a `` great fiasco,'' he said, participating in a rice-growing venture in the bush near <LOCATION> Darwin </LOCATION> that became a kitchen for millions of crop-devouring geese. But he stayed on to operate sheep and cattle stations that took him to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> annually for the past 30 years. `` I know <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> quite well,'' he said, `` I am very, very fond of Australians and the whole country.'' The April 30-Oct. 30 <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION> exposition will `` give a fresh look to world's fairs'' with its theme of leisure and technology, he said This is especially appropriate, since Australians spend the most of any country on sports, equipment `` and the fun of sports,'' <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON> said. The theme of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pavilion is sports and sports science. <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON>, 75, said his own devotion to fitness and daily exercise further qualifies him for the <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION> post. He said he skis six weeks a year, swims and plays tennis but has not yet taken up golf because `` I'm not old enough.'' In show business he directed or appeared in a series of successful radio and tv programs including `` People are Funny,'' `` Art <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' and `` Kids Say the Darndest Things.'' He has written several books, including `` Linkletter Down Under,'' about <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and the most recent, `` Old Age is Not for Sissies.''' In addition to sports industry exhibits, and daily demonstrations of gymnastics and smaller team sports at <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, `` we are going to have such things as deaf basketball players and wheelchair'' athletes in demonstrations of sports for the handicapped plus continuous workshops in many areas of amateur and professional sports and recreation, he said. Arrangements may be made for some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stars of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics to appear at <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION> on their way home from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON> said. Also there will be a modern health club, along with marching bands and many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> groups `` who are raising their own money and paying their way,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Real' Price Of Wheat Lowest Since Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says farmers could be forced to accept the squeeze between costs and prices as a permanent way of life if wheat price trends are an indicator of how the farm economy may develop in the future. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says farmers `` make more money when they become more efficient, they expand, or their terms of trade improve.'' Advances in technology have boosted yields of crops and livestock. Farms have gotten larger because of people leaving the land. But prices farmers get in relation to costs have tended downward over the years. Thus, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, two of the three ingredients for profitability have been working for farmers. But the third _ prices _ has worked against them. That results in the `` cost-price squeeze'' that has chewed on the farm economy for generations. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who is economics editor of Agricultural Outlook magazine, examined the price history of a single commodity _ wheat _ since 1800. Rising prices reflected growth in domestic and export demand from the beginning of the 19th century through the Civil War, which included inflated prices triggered by shortages during the 1861-65 war years. `` From then on, for more than a century, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture has shown a capacity to grow faster than its markets, and the trend in real wheat prices has been downward, with cycles from wars and depressions,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. In economic parlance, the `` real'' price of a commodity includes an adjustment for inflation. The `` nominal'' price does not include an inflation adjustment. During World War I, wheat prices spiked higher, but still were below the Civil War peak. In the 1920s, wheat prices declined as a farm depression took hold. Further downward pressure came in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Wheat prices rose again in World War II but were still below the levels of World War I. `` The real price -LRB- of wheat -RRB- fell from its World War II high throughout most of the 1950s and 1960s,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` There was a gradual downtrend in the nominal price, and inflation picked up, particularly since 1965.'' But prices received by farmers in the'50s and'60s were steadied by `` massive government programs'' which boosted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic price of wheat above the world price, he said. As fears of global hunger and grain shortages developed in the early 1970s, wheat prices were driven up to record levels and heralded a return to wide annual fluctuations, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. Even so, the real price of wheat at its 1973 peak was below the World War II high point. Wheat prices dropped in 1986, reflecting changes in federal supports authorized by the 1985 farm law, he said. That allowed lower market prices to induce more export and domestic use, while maintaining farm income through direct payments to growers. `` The price is edging up a little this year,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` Even so, the real price of wheat is well below what it was at the depth of the depressed 1930s, and the lowest it has been since Revolutionary times. At the same time, wheat yield per acre now is about three times what it was in the 1930s, and the wheat acreage per farm growing wheat is 10 times what it was.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> acknowldged that wheat accounts for `` a small percentage of total food outlays'' by American consumers and that the margin between the farm value of wheat and the final food product has been growing as a result of higher transportation, processing, packaging and other costs. `` Therefore, a stable consumer price is consistent with a decreasing wheat price,'' he said. `` Even so, wars, depressions and food crises are reflected in the price of wheat, and the price of wheat may be a useful proxy for long-run farm and food price trends.'' If that is the case, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said those who think that farm prices in the coming decades will rise relative to costs `` are calling for a fundamental change in the long-run trend.'' He added: `` It would appear more reasonable to expect farmers -LRB- and help them when necessary -RRB- to continue to find ways to make a living in the face of prospective long-run cost price squeeze, as they have done for the last century.''

 Existing organizations and private funds could help the federal government move ahead in rural development, says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>, executive vice president and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A partnership between private and public interests is necessary because rural communities must not be left behind as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy continues to change and grow, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` Unfortunately, many of these communities have experienced rapid declines during the last several years,'' <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> said in his statement. Loss of population, sluggish job growth, high unemployment or underemployment, poverty and an education gap were cited as major problems. <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>, who was secretary of agriculture in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said the association he represents is an example of existing networks that can be used to help with rural development. The <LOCATION> NRECA </LOCATION>, he said, provides service to 25 million people in 2,600 counties in 46 states. `` Today, the problems facing many rural communities have spurred electric cooperatives to increase their initiatives and activities in community and economic development,'' he said. <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> be authorized to make financing available to REA borrowers for rural development of business, industry and public works. <PERSON> REA </PERSON> is the federal government's chief lending agency for the rural electric and telephone cooperatives. The financial assistance could take the form of guarantees, loans, grants and the ability to create private revolving funds, he said. REA borrowers then could be encouraged to put together financial packages that would `` leverage federal funds with private capital.''

<TEXT>
 A special sweep of railroad traffic is credited with rescuing illegal aliens from possible suffocation in airtight boxcars, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents say. `` We feel that at least some of them would not have made it to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McAllen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sector </PERSON>, said Thursday. The 46 aliens, some of them dehydrated, had been crouched in a four-foot-high space in the boxcar about seven hours when discovered with the aid of dogs, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. `` Many of them were happy that they were finally out of that place, and said they were concerned that they were going to die in there,'' he said. Agents this week have been searching nearly every train car at a stop about six miles north of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. By Thursday the crackdown had netted 370 undocumented aliens and 120 pounds of marijuana, the patrol said. `` We identified three particular -LRB- smuggling -RRB- organizations out of this,'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. In discovering the dehydrated group in the sealed car, along with 16 more in two other cars, he said agents probably averted a tragedy similar to the incident last summer in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION>. Agents there found 18 aliens suffocated to death inside a sealed boxcar. Although temperatures in the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> have ranged in the 50s this week, the temperature inside the boxcar with 46 people in it was around 90 degrees, and would have become hotter, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. The group rescued Monday was dehydrated, but did not require hospitalization, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. More than 100 aliens escaped during the train raids, agents reported.

<HEAD>Dukakis Working To Lay To Rest Talk Of Brokered Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a widening edge in the delegate race, is working to lay to rest talk of a brokered Democratic National Convention. As the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination moves into a springtime series of Northern and Midwestern state contests, aides to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor are laying plans to drive the rest of the Democrats out of the race. `` It's conceivable we could have a nominating majority by the day after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' which is among the states to vote on the last day of the primary season June 8, says <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a senior campaign aide. More optimistic aides paint a scenario that would effectively clinch the nomination earlier. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rivals concede his superior organization, finances, fresh endorsements and other advantages. `` There's no state that's life and death for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, a spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, adding that most of the other contenders face make-or-break elections in the next few weeks But, they quickly add, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his message of managerial competence in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> statehouse have yet to stir the emotions of Democrats around the country, and a few bumps might be all it takes to shatter his candidacy. `` I think his lack of a message of what a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration would do is catching up with him,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` They have n't captured the hearts of Democrats. All they've been able to do is convince many that they're a safe bet,'' says <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> `` They have been moving along picking up delegates on tactics, not on message.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides insist their candidate has a sound campaign message. But they also argue tactics, saying that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s apparently secure Republican nomination is cooling the enthusiasm for a brokered Democratic convention. `` The fear of giving <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a head start is eventually going to help somebody, and if we do our job right, that person is going to be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, communications director. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' blueprint for the nomination calls for defeating <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses and driving him from the race. Next, aides seek a victory over <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on April 5, driving him from the race. They hope to follow up with victories in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> that cripple Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, even if he remains a candidate. That would leave <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides believe he is n't likely to win more than 900 or so delegates, out of 2,082 needed to gain the nomination. They say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is prepared to outline differences over policy issues with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later in the year, particularly over the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> and defense spending. During the period between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary on April 19 and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> a week later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides hope that many of the 645 `` super delegates'' to the convention _ the party leaders, members of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and governors _ will swing to their side. There is no disputing the strides <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made since he fell to third place in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>: _ He has 533.55 delegates according to a count by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, an increase of 69 in the past week. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, his nearest pursuer, has 511.55, an increase of 51. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has 360.8 overall, has added only six in that time, while <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, at 154, has added only nine. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> winner, has 171.5 delegates, 141 of them from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been endorsed since the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary by five senators, 10 congressmen and a governor. The biggest prize, Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, has been mentioned prominently as a possible compromise candidate in case of a deadlocked convention this summer. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the other contenders continue to vie for support from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. _ Recent national public opinion polls show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running strongly against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A nationwide survey conducted for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading the vice president 50 percent to 45 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in similar matchups. _ He won the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> caucuses a few days after <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voted, his first triumph in a predominantly agricultural state. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rivals say his finish in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ where he got 17 percent of the vote behind favorite sons <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and no delegates _ is symptomatic of a failure to attract widepsread support to his candidacy. They say he has particularly failed to demonstrate appeal among blue collar workers and conservative Democrats who will be essential to Democratic chances of capturing the White House. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also stands accused of flip-flopping on a key issue, belatedly embracing trade legislation to make himself more appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autoworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> members who will participate in Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses.

 The armed forces that keep Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in power went unpaid Friday and the broke and beleaguered government ordered businesses closed in the general strike to reopen. In a decree issued under a week-old state of emergency, the civilian government that does <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s bidding said it would take away the commercial licenses of any businesses `` offering goods and services to the public'' if they remained closed. The decree specifically mentioned grocery stores, pharmacies, transportation companies and gasoline stations. An estimated 90 percent of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s industry and businesses have shut down in the strike that began Monday in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal as the head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces that includes the military and police. The government's inability to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> kindled hopes in the opposition that loyalty for him will wane. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, including a secretary at military headquarters, said army, <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, police and air force personnel did not receive their semi-monthly paychecks as scheduled Friday. `` We did not receive our wages and we were not told when we would receive them,'' said the secretary, who declined to give her name. Soldiers questioned by reporters also said they had not been paid. In mid-March, most of the 130,000 public employees were given partial payment of at least $ 75 on their salaries. Those employees whose monthly salaries are $ 1,000 or more were not paid. Social security checks have been postponed. Demonstrators at the Roman Catholic cathedral protested the church's failure to issue a denunciation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as expected. Pilots who guide ships through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and claimed they had been harassed by soldiers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> demanded protection and met with the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Some pilots had spoken of a strike, but commission spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrellon </PERSON> said the situation was resolved at the meeting. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` There is no problem now.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained obstinate. He was asked at a military ceremony about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s renewed call for his departure and he replied: `` My president is called -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and my geographic space is called <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> I do n't take orders from extra-terrestrials.'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was named chief executive by the legislature when President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted on Feb. 26, the day after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Two members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Reps. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa., ended a two-day visit Friday and told a news conference they thought the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should increase economic pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on narcotics charges. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has cut the flow of money to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. The order for businesses to reopen was in Decree No. 16 issued under the state of emergency that enables the government to act as it deems necessary `` to secure public order,'' including suspending civil liberties. The decree also said any establishment that had been closed for the past five days and sold food, meats or canned goods `` can not reopen unless it is first inspected by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.'' It said store owners who do not comply face `` temporary suspension of their licenses or, in case of repeated violations, the cancellation of their commercial licenses.'' The strike began Monday and was called by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a broad alliance of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opposition. Crusade leaders said it would continue until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was ousted. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> employees have worked throughout protests and general strikes against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that began last June. The canal continues to operate normally while the nation around the waterway is at a virtual standstill. Most of the canal's 230 pilots are American citizens. Soldiers man roadblocks around the capital and they demand identification from drivers, search cars and rummage through personal belongings. Some pilots complained about those actions. About 100 people stalked out of the cathedral after Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> opened a special Mass by telling worshipers and observers the church would not issue the anticipated anti-Noriega statement. `` We do n't know how this mistaken rumor originated,'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. `` We are sorry, but it is not our fault.'' Civic Crusade leaders and <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> had said they had been assured the church would issue a strong condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Those who walked out stood on the steps of the gray stone cathedral chanting, `` Justice! Justice!'' and `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go!'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> told those remaining inside that he and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had a `` preparatory meeting'' Thursday. He did not explain and said he could not discuss the conversation.

 Democrats and Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are trying to settle the one major dispute left before the panel approves the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles. `` I think we'll be able to agree on something,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., leader of a group of Republicans who are seeking a compromise on the issue of how treaties are legally intepreted `` That is the only major question left and I would expect that we can solve it by next week,'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, said Thursday. The panel spent three days this week rejecting a series of challenges by conservative Republicans to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty and has set Tuesday afternoon for a final vote on the pact. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and other Democratic leaders have predicted overwhelming approval, both in the committee next week and by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next month when the Democratic-controlled chamber returns from an Easter recess. Ratification requires the approval of 67 of the 100 senators. The remaining fight centers on the dispute between the legislative and executive branches over the authority to interpret treaties. The disagreement arises from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assertion that his administration can unilaterally change the intepretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, a contention the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> disputes. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and other Democrats want some type of condition on the INF treaty that would block a future administration from changing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interpretation of the pact. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said one compromise being considered is attaching an amendment to the ratification resolution which says the INF treaty can not be reinterpreted by a future administration without prior consent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is one ay to solve it and remove the fight from this treaty without coming to a final answer on the intepretation issue,'' said <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>. The treaty was signed Dec. 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It requires the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. Anti-cheating provisions _ the strictest in arms control history _ include provisions for on-site inspections by each superpower in the other country. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the treaty has been criticized chiefly by conservative Republicans, including Sens. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> officials are preparing for an unusual secret session of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early next week to examine sensitive intelligence information about the number of SS-20 medium-range missiles possessed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A total of 650 were declared by the Soviets and those will be destroyed after the treaty takes effect. But <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> claims there are conflicting estimates by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies about the number of missiles, including one report by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that the Soviets may have up to 300 more SS-20s than they have declared. The Foreign Relations panel voted 15-2 Thursday to reject <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' amendment requiring new intelligence analyses of the SS-20 question Only <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> supported his proposal which would have required <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to certify the accuracy of the Soviet claims that they only have 650 SS-20s. The closed-door session will take place in the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. The small, historic room is normally maintained as a museum, but <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said it is better for the meeting than the current <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber. The new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is laced with a variety of cables that make it more difficult to protect security, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> explained. Later, the committee also rejected, 15-2, <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>'s plan to block implementation of the treaty until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certifies that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be jeopardized by the Soviets' advantage in a variety of non-nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> originally had 36 amendments, but dropped the majority of them after only <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> supported his proposals. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> also dropped some of his challenges in the face of widespread rejection.

<HEAD>Industry Says Southwestern Thrifts Have Caused Heavy Losses</HEAD>

 The heaviest savings institution losses since the Great Depression underscore the need for federal regulators to begin cleaning up the mire of insolvent institutions in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, savings and loan lobby groups say. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the nation's 3,147 savings institutions lost $ 3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, pushing red ink for the year to $ 6.8 billion, the worst loss since the agency began keeping track in 1934 `` I hope it's the worst we'll ever see,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insitutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group. The bank board said S & amp; L losses were heavily concentrated in states like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which are dependent on the ailing oil and gas industry. The worst 20 institutions _ most of them in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> _ lost a total of $ 2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year, accounting for two-thirds of the overall industry loss. `` The No. 1 item on the agenda is to stop the bleeding in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said. `` That's in the bank board's lap. ... And we hope they do it sooner rather than later.'' Until recently, the bank board has been forced to keep insolvent institutions open because it lacked the money to pay off depositors or entice a healthier S & amp; L into merging with the sick institution. The bank board said 345 S & amp; Ls were insolvent at the end of the year, 109 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> alone. An S & amp; L is considered insolvent when its loans and other assets are worth less than what it owes to depositors and other creditors. By the tougher accounting standards the bank board will be using next year, 510 would be considered insolvent. Yet, regulators closed only 17 institutions in 1987 and provided assistance for the merger of 26 others. Now that money has begun flowing from a three-year, $ 10.8 billion recapitalization enacted in August, bank board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> has pledged to pick up the pace. Last month, he announced a plan to spend $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> over the next several years, but the bank board said Wednesday it expected no announcements on specific institutions before early April. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> A. Regalia, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, warned that the bank board must move swiftly. `` On balance, next year will be not quite as bad, but that depends on how quickly you get rid of these institutions'' in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, said he believed the industry's problems have `` plateaued out'' and that `` there is some light at the end of the tunnel'' in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Industry losses in 1987 were nearly 50 percent greater than the previous post-Depression record of $ 4.6 billion, set in 1981, when the prime lending rate soared above 20 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Insured </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls lost $ 1.8 billion in the third quarter of last year and $ 1.9 billion in the spring. They earned $ 100 million in the first three months of the year and had a modest $ 132 million profit for all of 1986. In contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that the nation's 13,700 federally insured commercial banks earned $ 3.7 billion in 1987. Still, it was their lowest profit since 1933. Despite the overall loss for the S & amp; L industry, 66 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls earned money in the fourth quarter. The $ 1.3 billion earnings of 2,089 S & amp; Ls partly offset the $ 4.5 billion losses of the remaining 1,058 institutions. The percentage of institutions earning a profit has declined steadily for two years, from 81 percent in the first quarter of 1986 to 66 percent at the end of last year. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said part of the overall industry loss in 1987 can be attributed to a decrease in the corporate tax rate. He said some S & amp; Ls decided to push profits into 1988, when the top tax rate is 34 percent, rather than take them in 1987, when the rate was 40 percent.

 Israeli troops stormed a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> hospital and a mosque and killed two Palestinian demonstrators and wounding 18 in a new outbreak of clashes in the occupied lands. Most media coverage was barred. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> to express his `` dissatisfaction'' about today's scheduled meeting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and two members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative arm Also Friday, an Arab-American advocate of non-violent resistance to occupation called for the establishment of a `` parallel'' Palestinian government in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories. The army closed key areas of the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to the media, including the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> area, where the most of Friday's violent clashes occurred. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged Americans to stay away from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Easter and Passover are approaching, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Jewish holidays that usually attract tourists to the Holy Land. About 50 Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets into <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> compound Friday to subdue about 100 protesters who were hurling stones and bottles, hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Later, soldiers stormed the hospital to arrest six <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths who barricaded themselves on the roof, the army said. Reporters saw troops surround <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haras </PERSON> mosque after Friday's Moslem prayers, firing live ammunition and tear gas from the rooftops of nearby houses at several dozen stone-throwing Arab youths on the mosque's roof. Four Palestinians were wounded, hospital officials and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. After a two-hour confrontation, soldiers stormed the mosque, yanked down <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags raised by the protesters and lined up dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> teenagers against a wall. The army said 50 Arabs were arrested. The army said it was forced to break in when the stone-throwers refused to surrender. Television said it was the first time soldiers had stormed a mosque since unrest began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Another Arab was wounded in the village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. In the village of <LOCATION> Tarqumia </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, troops killed two Palestinians and wounded 13, witnesses and the radio said. The army said it was checking the reports but could not confirm them because relatives took the bodies. Troops entered <PERSON> Tarqumia </PERSON> at about 4 a.m. and took over the school, said <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON>, a 52-year-old teacher. The army has converted a number of schools into military bases since the unrest began and is using about half a dozen as temporary detention centers. `` Then about 500 youths marched out to the school and started throwing rocks and broken bottles,'' <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Murktan </PERSON>, 18, died of a gunshot wound to the stomach and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatatta </PERSON>, 18, was shot in the heart, villagers and <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said. Friday's fatalities brought to 111 the number of Palestinians killed by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> count in the anti-occupation unrest since Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Meanwhile, 72 percent of the Israelis questioned said they want harsher measures in the occupied territories. The Dahaf nstitute poll published in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said 7 percent of the 606 Israelis questioned this week supported less severe measures while 21 percent did not want policy changes. Also, 49 percent of those questioned said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan _ essentially an exchange of land for piece with the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> _ should be accepted. Forty-three percent were against it and 8 percent had no opinion. Israeli officials, however, reacted angrily to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' plans to discuss the peace initiative with two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> expressed his `` dissatisfaction'' during Friday's meeting with <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Lughod </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, violates a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment not to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In another development, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American advocate of non-violent resistance to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, called for forming a `` parallel'' government in the occupied territories. `` We should start thinking what kind of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state we are going to have, what to do with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where are the borders,'' he told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV. Israeli authorities confiscated <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport and Israeli identity card last year and ordered him expelled last November when his tourist visa expired. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> stayed following strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure.

 If Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaves, it could start a political free-for-all in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where 20 years of military rule with a civilian facade have given opposition parties little chance to mature. `` No dictatorship ever prepared a people for democracy,'' said editor <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, which the Noriega-controlled government shut down last month. Many political observers, including opposition party leaders, predict a `` free-for-all, no holds barred'' if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> goes. The general, who heads the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, says he is n't leaving. He has defied a huge opposition campaign and crippling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic pressure and even indicated he might run for president. The government-controlled news media have started referring to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as `` the undisputed leader of the political majorities'' of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. His predecessor, Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, abolished political parties in 1968 after taking power in a coup. In 1977, when he and then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> signed the Canal Treaties, <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> founded his own party. He let other parties campaign in 1984, but his <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won in what the opposition called robbery. Most parties here revolve around a single personality _ like 87-year-old <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> of the Authentic Panamanian Party, deposed three times as president by the military, and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who returned Thursday from exile. Others parties are what Panamanians call `` stationery.'' They exist on paper, issuing statements and communiques, but have no popular following. Political parties have not been in the forefront of the campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The drive has been led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of business, private organizations and professional groups and some labor unions. `` We do not have any political leadership. We are being led by businessmen,'' said a young man collecting food for residents of a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> slum. While the Civic Crusade was organizing national strikes and issuing calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign, most politicians applauded from the sidelines. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and some other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officials have been an exception. Last month, the Civic Crusade and most of the opposition parties formed an alliance and agreed that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> goes, they will work under a transitional government with deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as its head. The next election is scheduled for May 1989. The Authenic Panamanian Party, however, refused to join the alliance. Party leaders say they will never recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> because the party he represents robbed them of victory in the 1984 election. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> is a populist first elected in 1940 and first deposed late the following year. He was elected again in 1950 and deposed in 1951. He was elected president a third time in 1968 and deposed after 11 days in office. The Authentic Panamanians see <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> _ <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s vice presidential running mate in 1984 _ as a threat The Christian Democrats, the nation's largest opposition party, gave <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> the top spot on the 1984 coalition ticket because <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was seen as something of an egghead with little popular appeal. But since then, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>'s close cooperation with the Civic Crusade has positioned him for a presidential bid in a post-Noriega <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> returned Thursday, <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and a founder of the Civic Crusade, stood next to him as he greeted cheering well wishers. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> has also been busy building bridges with other political parties, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, in what is seen as an attempt to forge a new coalition. Some politicians say they do not expect the Crusade to survive long after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because its leaders are mostly business people without political affiliation. Typical of the Crusade leaders are <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, general manager of an insurance company, and <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>. Neither is affiliated with a political party. Other politicians, however, say the strong role people like <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON> have assumed in the Crusade could make them forces to be reckoned with if they remain active in public life.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says his lagging campaign for the Republican presidential nomination is being revived in caucus states that will strengthen conservatives' hand at the party convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Beyond that goal, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Thursday night, he is looking not only to lay the groundwork for another presidential campaign in 1992, but to help build <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strength in state houses and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the 1990s. Although <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was beaten by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his home state's non-binding primary on Super Tuesday, he told 700 supporters at <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> that they can still capture most of the state's delegates by turning out in force at local precinct meetings `` A few days from now we're going to be celebrating the most important event in the entire Christian calendar,'' said the former religious broadcaster, referring to Easter, which falls on April 3. He said the press wrote his candidacy off as dead after Super Tuesday, `` but I do n't think they're aware of the resurrection.'' He said his campaign swept county convention delegates in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and had picked up other delegates in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` All over this country, when June comes around and it's all over ... our people should be in significant places of responsibility in something like 15 or 20 of the state Republican parties,'' he said. `` We are going to put together a coalition that will go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> strong, speaking with one voice, and having enough political weight to make sure that some of the things we hold very dear ... are embodied in the platform of the Republican party,'' he said. `` In the next few weeks, as these caucuses unfold in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, we are going to win the majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he predicted. Asked as he left the rally if he was giving up in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, a caucus state where his campaign pulled the plug on a bank of 32 phones, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` We're going from paid phone banks to volunteer phone banks. The operation is still under way. I'm going out there for a series of meetings a week from Saturday.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> attacked the Civil Rights Restoration Act that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed Tuesday over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, as `` a horrible bill. It was a federal power grab ... a blot on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s worst problems, including crime and drugs, stem from erosion of morals, he said, adding, `` If we're going to restore the greatness of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we've got to go back to a sense of personal, individual responsibility.'' `` We must be No. 1 in our ethics, No. 1 in our morals, No. 1 in our lifestyles, No. 1 in our adherence to freedom, No. 1 in our trust and faith in God almighty,'' he said. `` We can not allow the radical Democrats to institutionalize aberrant behavior which is part of the destruction of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> freshman, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisshaar </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said afterwards that she was discomfited by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s repeated references to God and Christianity. `` I was n't sure if he meant freedom for everyone, or freedom for the people who believed in what he believed in,'' said the teen-ager, who is Jewish. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has just 17 delegates in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count to 788 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 178 for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>RMEILEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the chaos and intolerance that is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> is an oasis of liberty, a haven for people fleeing political and social persecution and assassination. This coastal town, 19 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, is what <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> used to be before 13 years of civil war, sectarian hatreds and religious fanatacism turned it into a wilderness. Leftists and other refugees from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the south have fled to <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> following a campaign of assassinations by Shiite Moslem fundamentalists against communists, pro-Iraqi Baath socialists and other leftists. One of the things that makes <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> different from just about everywhere else in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is that alcohol is sold openly at the side of the road. Alcohol is banned in most areas of the region, dominated by Shiite Moslem factions, and in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> stronghold in the capital. Islamic religious laws also ban mixed parties, mixed bathing and the consumption of pork. But in the summer, <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON>'s eight restaurants and three miles of <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> beaches and hillside picnic areas are packed with males and females having a good time. Pork also is sold. <PERSON> Hamza </PERSON>, 35, comes from the staunchly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> in the south. `` We ca n't buy drinks in <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> any more, so we come to <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON>,'' he said. `` In summer women have to come here to swim because it's the one of the very few places they can do that.'' Because he lives in a Shiite area, where such activities are forbidden, <PERSON> Hamza </PERSON> declined to disclose his full name. <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> was a mainly Christian town, with about 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION>, until 1985, when Moslem forces overran the coastal plain. Now only about 60 Maronite families are left. But <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> now is protected by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militiamen, most of them Christians, who are allied to neighboring Druse and Sunni Moslem forces who help keep the Shiites out. The Syrian army also has a checkpoint just south of <LOCATION> Rmeileh </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Awali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> which also acts as a deterrent for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rim </PERSON>, a leftist official in the town, said 500 refugee families _ Moslems, <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> and Palestinians _ live in <LOCATION> Rmeileh </LOCATION> with the local Christians. `` Our aim is to get rid of the sectarian atmosphere and implement co-existence,'' he said. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabet </PERSON>, director of the town's government school, said ethnic mix gives <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> a non-sectarian nature, where people from different areas and religions `` feel safe and free.'' <PERSON> Samih </PERSON> <PERSON> Germanos </PERSON>, 57, a Christian who fled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Shiite-controlled southern slums, said: `` We're very happy and hope things will stay this way. Acting Mayor <PERSON> Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleib </PERSON>, said the tourist influx last summer was even better than pre-war times. `` People in the south prefer <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> to other places because it's the closest resort to them that provides restaurants and private beaches as well as drinks,'' <PERSON> Kleib </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hujeiri </PERSON>, 40, a father of nine, who works at a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> plant in a nearby town, said he sells alcohol on the street to earn extra money and that most of his customers are from the Shiite south. `` I'm the only one to sell pork in this area,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Elie </PERSON>, a 32-year-old shopowner. `` I started bringing it from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week and in four days, I sold around 40 kilograms -LRB- 88 pounds -RRB-. Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party of God -RRB- have been blamed for many of the assasinations of leftists in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But since many of those who have fled to <PERSON> Rmeileh </PERSON> _ `` self-deportees,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> calls them _ are skilled or professional people, the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> recently asked them to return to their villages. <PERSON> Wafiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Rihan </PERSON>, a 33-year-old Shiite school teacher, did n't sound as though he is ready to return. He said that after he fled <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> last year the Communists and the leftist <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> `` helped us find places to stay and in the beginning we relied on Red Cross supplies.'' `` I'm teaching at the school now,'' he added. `` I was originally a teacher. But most of the other deportees here are also working in their particular fields, medicine, the law, and so on. `` One doctor who fled <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> even has some of his old patients come here to see him for treatment.'' <PERSON> Rihan </PERSON> said he wants to go back to his own village but only when it's safe.

<DATELINE>ARURA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Palestinians on night guard duty, masked and armed with clubs, sprinted down the main village road passing the word: `` Israeli soldiers are coming!'' Behind them, about 20 more moved in the dark with the speed of practice to block the road in a half-dozen places. They dragged stockpiled boulders and twisted metal onto the pavement to slow the 12 jeeps in the Israeli patrol. Palestinians whose faces were hidden by checkered keffiyeh headdresses whistled shrilly to each other across the rocky hills, tracking the army's progress on the narrow road. The overnight citizen patrol was in action, witnessed in this case by a journalist. The patrol at <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION> was one of dozens organized after the army started nighttime raids, arresting hundreds of alleged agitators in an effort to quell nearly four months of violent anti-Israeli protests. <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, 30, stood watch atop a ridge on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, a village of 2,200 Palestinians that sprawls over hills of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` Because of these patrols, we are ready for an attack from anywhere,'' he said. `` But there is more than that. The guard duty makes us unified as a people. Everyone feels he has a part in the uprising.'' Arab patrols are clandestine and all those interviewed would agree only to the use of their first names. Riots began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. More than 100 Palestinians and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed. The patrols are a sign of the changing nature and steady escalation of the `` intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising. They illustrate growing sophistication in a rebellion that began spontaneously and, for that reason, worry Israeli officials. `` Illegal local organization could lead to illegal regional organization, all of it directed against us,'' a military man said privately. On this night the army jeeps stopped short of <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, parked for about half an hour, then drove away. Why the soldiers approached and left in the latest cat-and-mouse game was not clear, but the villagers viewed called it a retreat by the enemy and a victory for themselves. Residents said soldiers had approached <PERSON> Arura </PERSON> on three occasions since the patrols began, but stopped each time when guards alerted villagers and about 1,000 people gathered in the streets, chanting and throwing stones. Patrolling in <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, as witnessed on two evenings, is a methodical and sometimes tense business. Men carrying clubs and rocks, their faces covered, stop each passing car. Strangers are ordered out of their vehicles until they are determined to be friends and not <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in plainclothes or Jews from the nearby <LOCATION> Ateret </LOCATION> settlement. Between cars and sightings of soldiers, the sentinels often engage in mutual pep-talk. They encourage each other to continue the fight against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, make optimistic predictions about the uprising and sometimes ward off the night cold with a shared glass of sweet herb tea. <PERSON> Tahir </PERSON>, 23, said he would stand guard until 5 a.m. then leave for his job in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> factory, where he packs oranges. `` I'm one person at night and another in the day,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, they have no idea that I am taking my turn, once a week, on patrol.'' Nightly patrols were organized in <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION> about a month ago after the army had made four raids in a six-week period, arresting 21 young men. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have rounded up more than 700 Palestinians in the past week in an effort to end the rebellion, and about 3,000 have been detained since the violence began. Soldiers are ordered to make arrests overnight, when most people are sleeping, to avoid causing violent protests. `` They wo n't catch us sleeping here and they wo n't be able to arrest us. We are watching for them every night,'' said <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 22, one of 250 men of Arura aged 16 to 45 who take turns on guard duty from about 8 p.m. until dawn. Boys under 16 are not taken for the patrols, but many children are eager to do their part. Four boys huddled for warmth over smoldering embers in a small, smoky cave beside the road to the village. They said they would remain until 2 a.m., and if a man came running with word of approaching soldiers they would race through the rocky hills helping wake the villagers. `` I feel like a man because I am doing something to resist the Israelis,'' <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> told a reporter with a solemnity far beyond his 11 years. `` This is in the interest of our homeland. It is the duty of everyone to help.''

<TEXT>
 Fund-raisers for <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> were ordered to tell people they owed the political extremist money because he was preventing Soviet aggression and global economic collapse, a former <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> aide testified. The fund-raisers also were told that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> needed the money to pay for security to protect him from assassins, former aide <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> testified Thursday at the federal trial of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, six aides and five <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> political groups. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> followers were treated as soliders and warned repeatedly that falling short of daily quotas was `` the moral equivalent of treason'' and would result in the immediate collapse of Western civilization. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s top fund-raising operative, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirtz </PERSON>, said prospective donors should be told <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> prevented a Soviet takeover, was the only Democratic presidential candidate not under <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> influence and the only man on earth who could prevent global economic disaster. The warnings were given in late 1983 and 1984, when <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> followers were under stringent fund-raising quotas because of his campaign and the pending move of organization headquarters from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, is charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that his followers raised more than $ 2 million through credit card and loan fraud. Four LaRouche organizations, including his two 1984 campaign committees, are charged with fraud. Those organizations and a fifth LaRouche group are charged in the alleged obstruction, as are the six aides. Prosecutors, through <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, are attempting to show that intense pressure from <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> led followers to solicit loans by falsely promising they would be repaid and by submitting unauthorized charges to the credit card accounts of past donors to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> causes. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and defense lawyers have conceded some <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> fund-raisers might have committed credit card fraud but contend <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and top aides relieved those fund-raisers of their duties when allegations of impropriety surfaced. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> contends the allegations of nationwide fraud were concocted as part of a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plot to ruin him because he opposed Contra aid and because his fund-raising competed with former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s private effort to resupply the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had halted government aid. The 125-count indictment against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and the other defendants, however, charges that three <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> fund-raisers were ordered by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> to destroy records and flee the country to avoid being called before the grand jury. The three were indicted but are fugitives.

 The slaughter of Kurdish civilians in Iraqi poison gas attacks and Iranian warnings of retaliation underscore the growth of the chemical warfare arsenals of major <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> powers. Despite efforts to curb such weapons, their spread has added a dangerous new dimension to conflicts in the volatile <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Their use, but not their production, is banned under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. The London-based <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> noted in a recent study that the use of poison and nerve gases since 1984 in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war has `` changed the rules of war in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes have dropped chemical bombs on several villages in northwestern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after Iranian forces overran the Kurdish area in a round offensive. Western correspondents in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have reported evidence to substantiate Iranian claims that 5,000 Iraqi Kurds were killed and another 5,000 injured when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped chemical bombs on towns captured by the Iranians in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeston </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, one of the towns, that `` hundreds and possibly thousands'' of the Kurds, who have been rebelling against <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for years, were killed. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s representative on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, warned Thursday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be forced to use chemical weapons in retaliation if the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks continue. The intensity of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s accusations against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in recent days has heightened fears that the Iranians may be seeking to justify using chemical weapons of their own. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday there was evidence <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may already have fired chemical artillery shells into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He declined to elaborate. `` It's entirely likely that the Iranians could do so,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in a telephone interview. `` They've had these weapons used against them for a long time.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a signatory to the 1925 agreement, has been condemned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nation </LOCATION> four times since 1984 for using chemical weapons. The Iranians claim the Iraqis have launched around 100 chemical attacks in that period, mainly against Iranian troops. Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas fighting the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> regime for autonomy have claimed scores of such attacks on their villages in the last year. But last week's bombing appears to have been the worst chemical attack in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict. Germ warfare dates back to the 14th Century, when the Tartars catapulted the rotting corpses of plague victims into the besieged Crimean city of <LOCATION> Kaffa </LOCATION> in a bid to spread disease. Modern chemical warfare began at on April 22, 1915, at 5 p.m. when the Germans released 180 tons of chlorine gas at <LOCATION> Ypres </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in World War I. Within an hour, 5,000 French soldiers were dead or dying from the wind-blown gas rolling a few fet above their trenches. By the end of the war, gas had killed 100,000 men and affected more than 900,000 others. Modern nerve gases are far more lethal. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has the biggest chemical weapons armory in the region, with sizable stocks of poison and nerve gases produced at three top-secret plants, Western military analysts told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymnity, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is now producing <PERSON> Sarin </PERSON>, a highly lethal nerve gas that can kill in less than 10 minutes. They said there are indications that the Iraqis are also working on germ warfare weapons. The sources estimated that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> can now produce 60 tons of mustard gas a month and four tons each of Sarin and <LOCATION> Tabun </LOCATION>, another highly lethal nerve agent. <LOCATION> Tabun </LOCATION>, first developed by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before World War II but never used, is a colorless gas that attacks the body's muscular centers and causes asphyxiation within 15 minutes. The sources said the Iraqis' main production plant is at <LOCATION> Samarra </LOCATION>, a heavily guarded 10-square-mile complex ringed by Soviet-supplied Sa-2 anti-aircraft missiles 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. On the other side, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s chief military spokesman, <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>, has said his country is producing chemical weapons. The analysts and diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Iranian chemical weapons are believed to be mainly mustard and phosgene gases. <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> noted: `` These are relatively simple to manufacture from readily available industrial components, as is hydrogen cyanide. Only the more complex nerve gases are likely to pose a chemical challenge to the Iranians.'' The Syrians, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally, also have developed their own chemical weapons industry over the last few years, intelligence and diplomatic sources said. The Israelis allege the Syrian chemical warfare capability is a serious threat and say <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has the means to deliver nerve agents with Soviet-supplied SS-1 Scud-B missiles and combat aircraft.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: New Treaty May Not Be Ready For Reagan To Sign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the uphill climb to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week made a couple of proposals to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on a new treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons. One was the exemption of spy satellites from treaty restrictions. The other was that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators make a supreme effort to define space-based testing and deployment. The Soviets seemed taken with the satellite proposal, but sharpening definitions of space tests and space deployments could be very difficult. There's always been a question whether technology sent into space is part of a permissible test or is a tricky step toward an illicit anti-missile deployment. In any event, with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting only nine weeks away, the outlook for completing the new U.S.-Soviet treaty is not bright. The biggest problem is verification _ making sure cutbacks are carried out. Two types of long-range weapons are especially hard to monitor. One is the land-based mobile missile. The other is the sea-launched cruise. Experts assisting Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were unable to resolve the problem during three days of talks here. And yet, the two sides apparently still intend to try to include the weapons in the accord with all bombers, submarines and missiles having a range in excess of 3,000 miles. The Soviets proposed a joint experiment next month to see whether monitors could determine if an American ship was carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected the proposal as unlikely to solve the detection problem. On another front, a little headway was made. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative, probably the biggest obstacle to the treaty, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space defense program will be dealt with separately by the negotiators. The Soviets claim the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program, known popularly as Star Wars, violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. They have threatened at various times to hold up a new accord to reduce strategic nuclear weapons unless the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to develop a defense against ballistic missile were curbed. That `` linkage'' has not been removed. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday night `` the two things move in parallel.'' In other words, the Soviets are retaining the right suddenly to halt progress on arms reductions unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slows down SDI. `` Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been realized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done,'' the two sides said in a communique winding up three days of talks. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will meet again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on April 21. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators will keep trying to agree on three drafts for the treaty. One deals with the elimination of weapons, another with verifying the cutbacks and the third with the size and location of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic arsenals. Before flying home, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called the rejected Soviet proposal to verify sea-launched cruise missiles a breakthrough in verification. He said the Soviets had similar ideas for monitoring mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and air-launched cruises. `` I hope that at the April round we will find solutions for a number of these problems,'' the Soviet foreign minister said. But he was not all that optimistic about concluding a treaty before the June 29 summit meeting. `` I ca n't guarantee that a treaty will be signed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but it is a possibility, given enough effort,'' he said.

 For 58 hours after a toddler tumbled into an abandoned well, hundreds of rescuers worked together to free her, but now an effort to bring their heroism to television has divided them. Two groups _ one mostly volunteer rescuers and the other city officials _ are negotiating separately with different TV producers for a movie of the story that captured the nation's attention as it unfolded live on television. Both groups are awaiting the endorsement of Chip and <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, whose 23-month-old daughter <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> became stuck in a 22-foot-deep well for 58 hours in October. One volunteer rescuer, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>, said he is remaining neutral in the dispute. But he said he wonders whether the story could be told properly in any case. `` I am wondering if a unified group got together ... if a really true, accurate picture of what took place could ever be put on the screen,'' said <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airmaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which contributed drilling materials for the rescue. The effort brought praise and a spotlight to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, an oil town of 97,400 people in western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It was a special event. There was so much effort, and everyone had their own story. Maybe it should be kept special like that,'' he said Thursday. The <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> <PERSON> Rescuer </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of about 30 volunteers, is committed to a movie deal with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> producer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The group has asked all rescuers to join them. The association's president, <PERSON> Kragg </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said 33 members have signed a contract that includes an initial $ 200,000, plus future payments, to be divided among the membership. The other group, the <ORGANIZATION> McClure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has narrowed its selection to an unidentified producer but has not signed any commitments. The association, comprising 11 municipal officials including Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Czech </PERSON>, Fire Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and paramedic <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, wants nothing to do with <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>. `` We found that he was going around to individual members of our association offering each member side deals that the others did n't know about,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allday </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the group <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> says everyone was offered the same deal _ a chance to consult in the production or to act in it. Either group or neither group could end up actually making a film. <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> still needs a commitment from a network for his project. `` My advice to anyone is if they have not signed with the producer to not do so until the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> say who they want the movie to be made by,'' said <PERSON> Allday </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> have said they do n't want to profit by their daughter's story, but do not want to stand in the way of the story being told. <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON> said Thursday he is concerned that the group of municipal workers will not allow others to help negotiate a movie deal. He said he and other neutral volunteers are working to bring the groups together `` so that the same type of unity and spirit as depicted last October can return.'' `` I'm sad about this problem,'' he said. `` My concern is that there were several hundred people out there and it is not right that maybe the lady that brought us hamburgers at three in the morning, or the guy who brought the sanitary privvies down _ how do you say they should not be in the movie, too?''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is trying to determine whether a couple employed by the agency and earning more than $ 100,000 a year improperly billed it for more than $ 3,600 in personal expenses. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said Thursday that department general counsel <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is heading the ethics board inquiry, which is not expected to take more than a few days. The review was started after a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> newsletter _ the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> Report _ obtained copies of travel vouchers for <ORGANIZATION> Paget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON> under a Freedom of Information Act request. <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON> is associate commissioner of the family youth services bureau of HHS. Her husband, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> office of communications technology. Both are political appointees who began working at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. The newsletter said the couple flew to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, near the <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON>'s family for a one-week stay over Thanksgiving 1985, apparently taking their child with them. They billed the government a total of $ 2,224 for that trip. <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON>'s voucher said her purpose was to visit shelters for runaway youth in the area. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON> said he attended a conference and met with a video company in connection with a film on the government's disability insurance program. The newsletter said <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON> charged the government $ 1,410 for a 1987 Thanksgiving trip to the same area. Neither of the two people under investigation could be reached. Officials in the branches where they work said it would be inappropriate for them to comment while the matter was under review. <PERSON> Paget </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinch </PERSON> is paid about $ 57,000 a year and her husband about $ 55,000.

 Every week or so, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> lugs a rifle out to the back yard, casually aims at a pile of jeans on the ground, then fires once, twice, so many times she loses count. `` It's putting bullets to a good use, rather than going around killing people with them,'' the fashion designer said, blasting holes into a pair of blue denims. The 33-year-old entrepreneur sells her bullet-riddled Calamity Jeans for $ 45 a pair. Her trademark is a leather bull's eye stitched to the right hip pocket and a spent .357 - caliber Magnum cartridge that dangles from the She also creates Calamity Jewels: earrings, necklaces, belts, boot bracelets, key chains and just about anything else she can make with dull, lead bullets and the shinier brass and nickel casings. Her jewelry, which ranges in price from $ 4 to $ 65, triggered intense interest at specialty stories from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` You could n't wear it with a business suit or a nice dress. That would be kind of strange,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s trendy J. DeStefino Cosmetique shop `` But with the right outfit, it's great.'' There are those who would n't be caught dead packing the `` loaded'' look. `` I wish I were there. I'd picket her. I think it's sick. I honestly think it's sick,'' said Mr. <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> fashion designer and creator of the annual 10 Worst Dressed List. Still, the acerbic arbiter of haute couture is n't surprised by the appeal. `` There's a certain amount of fashion madness that will be bought,'' he says. `` If Seventh Avenue would come out with greasy paper bags, you'd have every woman -LRB- in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> -RRB- wearing a greasy paper bag.'' In a townhouse in a quiet, woodsy complex 350 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> is taking her best shot at breaking into the fickle fashion market. She took up designer jeans in 1986 after a friend invited her over for target practice on a roving boyfriend's treasured possession. `` She said he was cheating on her and she was going to take his favorite pair of blue jeans and shoot holes in them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> recalled, laughing. Afterward, when the women pulled the tattered trousers down from the tree, Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> liked what she saw. So did the boyfriend. And a style was born. The next step was to stock up on bullets. `` I had to go to these gun shops and these guys looked at me like I was a space alien,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> says. `` I'd say, ` Do you have anything in silver?' And they're like, ` What? What do you mean silver?' `` I was looking at them appearance-wise. They were looking at them as functional.'' Once she got the ammunition home, Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> carefully pried open the .22 - caliber cartridges and dumped out the She then faced the problem of detonating the primer in the shell that explodes and ignites the gunpowder. Being rather gun-shy, she fried the casings in a skillet. `` I covered it, then I ran because I did n't know what was going to happen,'' she said. It was `` like popcorn,'' and it worked. She forged the de-activated casings with bullets into jewelry, then peddled her wares from store to store and at craft shows. The jewelry eventually made its way into shops around the country. Buoyed by her success, Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> borrowed a friend's .22 - caliber rifle and branched into jeans last year, using her back yard or occasionally a friend's farm as her So far, she has shot and sold more than 200 pairs of jeans, mostly to folks in their teens, 20s and 30s. She has orders for dozens more as well as for skirts, vests and jackets peppered with small, frayed holes. Requests come from as far away as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where people have read about her efforts. Demand is so great she's begun ordering generic clothes in bulk. `` A lot of hunters like them because they're into their guns,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ludwin </PERSON> said. `` The teen-agers want to be different.'' Although she's sold more than $ 21,000 worth of merchandise, the divorced mother of one barely is breaking even, due largely to business start-up costs. Still, she believes hers will be a genuine `` rags to riches'' story. `` I totally think this is a great idea and it's going to go,'' she says. `` And if it does n't, I'm sure one day, I will think of something.

 A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> nail salon may refuse an AIDS victim a pedicure because there is no conclusive evidence on how the deadly disease is spread, a judge ruled. A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> ordinance banning AIDS discrimination `` fails to respect the right not to be involuntarily exposed to a risk of personal harm,'' Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasperson </PERSON>, 36, had sued <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s Nail Salon for canceling his 1986 appointment after employees overheard him telling an acquaintance he had AIDS. The suit did n't seek damages, only a court-ordered pedicure. `` It is a health issue, not a civil rights issue,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Geragos </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s, said Thursday. `` The ordinance is still in place, but the city of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> took the shotgun approach and made the ordinance so broad it has to be interpreted case-by-case.'' <PERSON> Jasperson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, called the decision `` a slap in the face for the city of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, which led the way in the country with this ordinance.'' `` This decision leads us into days of darkness and years of fear,'' she said. She said there is n't `` one documented case in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of anyone getting AIDS from a manicure or pedicure.'' Lawyers for <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s Salon had argued that refusal was justified because experts are n't positive how AIDS is transmitted. `` Is it necessary to maintain your livelihood to expose yourself to the danger of death?'' <PERSON> Geragos </PERSON> asked during the non-jury trial. `` We're talking about self-protection and self-defense.''

 The mother of two soldiers was relieved, a shoe store owner was hopeful and opposition leaders welcomed the Contra-Sandinista cease-fire agreement, but all were skeptical about whether it will bring peace. `` Every mother, even though she does n't have sons in service, should be happy about peace,'' said <PERSON> Auxiliadora </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, whose two sons had been drafted into the army. `` Nicaraguans must not continue dying.'' `` We urgently need peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, who sells cosmetics in the <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Huembes </PERSON> market. `` All these eight years have been ones of horror.'' More than 40,000 people have died since the fighting began in November 1981, two years after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> overthrew the rightist regime of the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>.

The war and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo have cost the country $ 3.8 billion in lost income, according to government figures.

 The last surviving commander of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Uprising said he was not invited and had no plans to take part in government observances marking the 45th anniversary of the Jewish anti-Nazi revolt. Dr. <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, 66, a former commander of the Jewish fighters, said Thursday he will organize a ceremony at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Jewish cemetery April 17 to dedicate a monument to two Polish Jewish socialist leaders executed by the Soviets during World War II <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a staunch supporter of the outlawed Solidarity free trade union, said he has invited <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> leaders. Several thousand Jews from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other countries are expected to come for the weeklong official observances that culminate April 19 with a ceremony at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> monument to heroes of the uprising. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said he was not invited to attend the official celebrations. `` They did n't invite me, but I would n't have taken part in it anyway,'' said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a cardiologist in the central city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>. `` I have never taken part in it because I think this government, which is a totalitarian government, has no right to act in such matters,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He had refused an invitation from authorities to participate in the April 1983 observances of the 40th anniversary of the uprising. In the uprising, several hundred poorly armed Jewish fighters fought a desperate battle resisting the final <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> drive to liquidate the ghetto's 60,000 remaining Jews. About 360,000 Jews had already been deported from the ghetto to Nazi death camps. This year, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> has invited Poles and foreign guests to join him at the ceremony at the Jewish cemetery. He said Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was expected to attend. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> plans to unveil a stone monument honoring <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wiktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Alter </PERSON>, two leaders of the Bund, a Jewish socialist labor organization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, who were sentenced to death and executed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in December 1941. `` It is important for me personally because I was connected with those people,'' said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who as a leader of the Bund's youth organization in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> ghetto was given a command post in the uprising led by <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Anielewicz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> escaped through the sewers when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> finally crushed the uprising.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is taking steps that could exempt farmers and their families from a new law requiring special licenses to drive trucks. Much to the relief of the agricultural community, the agency said Thursday it will consider excluding farmers and firemen from proposed truck licensing regulations scheduled to take effect in July. Unless changed, the rules will require a commercial license for anyone to drive a truck weighing more than 26,000 pounds or any vehicle with a hazardous cargo. The regulations are to implement provisions of a 1986 law to improve highway safety by establishing a uniform system of truck and bus driver licensing. Farmers have complained that the law could cover some large trucks used to transport grain and hay or even pickups carrying bulk fuel tanks and some fertilizers. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., chief sponsor of the licensing law, welcomed the department's announcement, calling it `` an important step toward ensuring that the 1986 act ... does not necessarily burden farm families that operate trucks in the course of daily business. Congressmen have also been deluged with mail from associations representing many of the nation's 225,000 paid and 900,000 volunteer firefighters who see costly new rules being imposed on their members. The law gives the secretary of transportation the power to exempt categories of vehicles from the licensing provisions, which in general would require an extensive written and road test for a commercial driver. The department, which has not issued its final licensing regulations spelling out those standards, said it would open a special proceeding to consider waivers for some classes of farm vehicles and some firefighting trucks. This regulatory step is necessary before the agency can grant an exemption. `` I ca n't imagine opening up a comment period ... and then not granting an exemption for farmers and firemen,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., `` It's my interpretation that they will be exempted. Contending that the regulations would burden these drivers, rural lawmakers like <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> have introduced legislation to exclude locally used farm trucks and firefighting vehicles from the new regulations. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> has indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would move `` as expeditiously as possible towards resolution of this issue'' after it receives comments. The law, which takes effect this year, is being phased in to give the states time to adjust their licensing systems to meet federal minimum standards of large commercial trucks. Truck drivers generally will have until April 1992 to obtain a commercial license which complies with the federal standards although states may set earlier deadlines.

 After more than a year and a half perched atop two 43-foot poles to raise money for cancer research, <PERSON> Mellissa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> came down to earth to a place in the record books and the fiance she has never dated. `` Everything looks so small, so different from here,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 19, said Thursday after a fire truck's bucket brought her down from the three-story-high shack where she spent 517 days with her feline companion, Pole Cat. `` My knees are wobbly but I feel great,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who was embraced by her mother, <PERSON> Mauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` Without the cat, I would never have made it,'' she said. `` It was pretty cramped quarters, but it was n't so bad. I'll miss it.'' Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' shack in the sky measured 6-by-7-by-9 feet. It had a plastic kiddie pool for bathing, a chemical toilet, television and a telephone that resulted in regular $ 300 phone bills. Among the 1,000 people waiting on the ground for Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was her fiance, 25-year-old <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` She's kind of hesitant,'' Seal said. `` She's wondering what's going to happen and knows she'll miss all the attention. The pole sitter thanked her sponsors, and accepted bouquets and contributions. Then she climbed into a stretch limousine for a drive around town. Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said she was looking forward to `` a good long walk and a real shower.'' She raised $ 10,000 for cancer research, but had hoped her effort would bring $ 100,000. Her sister, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, has cancer and has been in remission for four years. The <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, native broke the world pole sitting record Feb. 26 when she overtook the 488-day mark set by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, winning her a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. Pole sitting runs in the family. Her mother set a record in 1959 by spending 211 days in the air. `` I'm sure she'll look back on this with fond memories,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' aunt, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` Maybe she saved a life by doing this. And that's about all you can ask for.'' Firefighters were on hand to make sure Miss Sanders got down safely. `` She's going to look up and be lonely when she passes by here next,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON>. `` It's been her home and when you take someone out of their home _ no matter how much they want to go _ they're going to look back with longing.'' However, <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was not coming down a moment too soon. `` I've been waiting a year for this,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> agreed it was time for her daughter to return to earth. `` All this does n't seem real,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` We want her back with us, but honestly it seems like only yesterday that she went up there.'' Before coming down, Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said there `` were some real sad times, times that were real hard.'' `` But I always knew I would make it, even when I was scared or going through hard times,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who rode out 70 mph winds during a February snowstorm. Miss <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> plans to return to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in May, and hopes to go to a trade school there. Seal first contacted Miss Sanders after reading a newspaper story about her in November 1986. They communicated, but did not meet in person until November 1987. `` Now that she's getting down, we have to start dating,'' said Seal. `` I mean we're already engaged and we have n't even gone on a date.'' He predicted that the next time the couple passed by the intersection where they first met, `` I'll probably look up, then over to her and say she was crazy for spending a year and a half of her life up there.''

<HEAD>Cyclosporine Used in Cadaver Skin Grafts on Burn Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY McDONALD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A potent anti-rejection drug can safely be administered orally to severe burn patients, and appears to help skin grafts from cadavers last longer, says a leading burn specialist. `` I think it's a good first step, but it needs a lot more work,'' Dr. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, who used the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine on 13 patients, said in an interview Thursday. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a plastic surgeon and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Sherman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was to report his findings today at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting here. Cyclosporine has been used in injection and oral form to prevent rejection by the body's immune system of newly transplanted hearts and other organs. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said his work over the past year and a half showed that oral doses of the drug are also safe for skin transplants. He said it also appears that cyclosporine enables cadaver skin to `` take'' to the body's skin longer, reducing the need for several expensive cadaver skin grafts and providing a more attractive appearance than laboratory-grown skin. Without cyclosporine, cadaver skin is rejected within a week to 10 days, he said. Cadaver skin is mainly used to buy time for a few weeks until the patient has enough skin of his or her own to be transplanted. Repeated cadaver skin grafts are made until that time. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, chief of staff at the <ORGANIZATION> Shriners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has not seen <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>'s study, but said the prolongation effect appears to represent `` tremendous potential.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said more studies comparing cadaver skin transplants with and without the drug need to be done. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> is not the first burn specialist to use cyclosporine on severe burn patients. Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Achauer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> used injections of the drug with poor results, and later used an oral dose on one patient, who survived, <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said he decided to try lower, oral doses. Because of concern over kidney failure in burn patients, the <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> study on nine patients referred to in his paper and on four subsequent patients used increasingly lower doses. `` Our original purpose was to let the cadaver skin stay on a while until we could reharvest the patient's own skin,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said. `` But we found after about three or four weeks that it was staying on for good.'' The first patient in the study was kept on cyclosporine for two months after his discharge from the hospital, <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said. `` But with each successive patient we found they needed less and less'' cyclosporine. With the last patients in the study, the medication was discontinued before discharge, within six weeks of the injury. `` I do n't believe that using cadaver skin with a possibly dangerous drug is the be-all and end-all,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said. `` I think we're plugging a dike until the right thing comes along.'' That, he said, would be improvements in the use of laboratory-grown skin.

 Corrupt city health inspectors doubled and tripled their annual salaries by extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from restaurants, federal officials said after the arrest of more than two dozen employees. `` The restaurant owners would dread seeing these inspectors pull up in their Cadillacs and <PERSON> Rolex </PERSON> watches,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, assistant director in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` They turned the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> into their own Department of Wealth.'' City health-code inspections of restaurants will be temporarily suspended while the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> reorganizes. `` The revelations of widespread and longstanding corruption among restaurant inspectors are particularly repellent and painful because of the importance'' of public health, Health Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. Twenty-eight people, including health inspectors, their supervisors and former <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who acted as middlemen, were charged Thursday with extorting money from restaurateurs. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees earned annual salaries of $ 25,000 to $ 30,000. If convicted, each could face a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail and a fine of $ 250,000. The charges contained in the complaint represent about one-third of the employees responsible for enforcing the city's health code, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Inspectors allegedly secured the extortion money by threatening to cite restaurants for health-code violations. About 300 of the city's 15,000 restaurants were victimized, ranging from fast-food establishments to little ethnic places to some tony <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> spots. A chart released by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> showed that the restaurants were in all five boroughs, with the largest concentration on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. The names of the restaurants were withheld because the owners are considered victims and because the information could hinder a grand jury investigation, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. The city's Department of Investigations and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> combined separate investigations, dubbed `` Kitchen Net'' and `` Operation Sanisweep'' respectively, in 1986. They used a combination of confidential informants, undercover agents and physical and electronic surveillance. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said if a restaurant owner refused to give an inspector a payoff during a regular inspection, the inspector would claim to find mouse droppings or dead flies in the restaurant and threaten to issue violations or, in some cases, close the restaurant. In one case, on-site inspectors demanded $ 1,400 from a restaurant owner to prevent the establishment from being closed for serious health violations, authorities said. In another, inspectors charged a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> restaurant $ 1,200 to allow it to reopen despite serious code violations. A confidential informant told authorities that he and another inspector made up to six stops a day and collected $ 500 to $ 1,000 in payoffs from owners at each restaurant, according to <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. The extortion payoffs were shared with inspectors' supervisors, authorities said. One senior inspector was called `` Hungry Joe'' by his fellow inspectors because he made so many demands. In addition, he said, former <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspectors and others established `` consulting'' companies that would advise restaurants on how to pass inspections and would act as middlemen for the extortions. Supervisors allegedly would recommend these consulting services to restaurants and then take a percentage of the consultation fee, authorities said.

 Before his arrest on fraud charges, a high-living 23-year-old investment adviser lured customers by falsely telling them that his other clients included the <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, authorities say. Those allegations were contained in criminal charges against <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> is expected to plead guilty at a court appearance next week, according to his lawyer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who was not licensed as an investment adviser, allegedly lied to clients by telling them their funds were invested in the stock market when he was actually pouring the money _ more than $ 10 million worth _ into private purchases. Among his purchases were works of art totaling $ 5.5 million; an $ 830,000 <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment; a beach house in East Hampton worth $ 1.9 million; two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> _ worth $ 200,000; and home furnishings that cost $ 800,000. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> also bought `` numerous items of expensive jewelry; and deluxe trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> for himself, his family and friends,'' according to the federal charges of mail fraud and securities fraud. The charges say that <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> `` falsely told investors that he managed money for prominent individuals and investors, including the <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family, the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> -LRB- and -RRB- <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>.'' In a brief appearance before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> waived his right to have his case heard by a grand jury. After he entered a plea of innocent, Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> assigned the case to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> apparently was ready to plead guilty before <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, but the judge was unavailable and the case was scheduled for next Thursday. If found guilty of the two charges against him, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on each count and a maximum fine of twice the amount lost by investors. Bloom was arrested Jan. 14 on a federal complaint charging him with fraud. He had begun investing money for friends while at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and had 130 clients at his <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> at the time of his arrest. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> has said many of the items Bloom purchased would be sold and his clients could recover their money and a profit. The assets were turned over to a court-appointed receiver.

<HEAD>Wedtech Witness Says He Gave $30,000 to D'Amato Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive says the scandal-plagued defense contractor contributed to numerous political campaigns, not because of ideology but `` for favors we expected to get.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also testified Thursday that he gave under different names, about $ 30,000 to Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to evade election law contribution limits. Federal election law limits individual campaign contributions to $ 1,000 per election and bars corporate contributions. A <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> spokesman branded <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s testimony `` ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s claims came during defense cross-examination at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and six others. Prosecutors have said <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> will testify for the government. The prosecution contends <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> enlisted the help of <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and other politicians to help secure no-bid contracts for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, then extorted millions of dollars in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> stock as a payoff. He and his co-defendants are accused of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes for government contracts and other favors. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> is among four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives cooperating with the government in return for leniency on state and federal charges to which they pleaded guilty. Defense attorney <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Nessen </PERSON> got <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who was on the witness stand for the eighth day Thursday, to admit he and other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives contributed to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and other public officials who have not been charged with wrongdoing. `` Now <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>. There were contributions to his campaign that you in fact hid and put under different names so you could violate the limits on campaign contributions. Is n't that correct,'' <PERSON> Nessen </PERSON> asked. ` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Nessen </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> if he had given <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> close to $ 30,000, the witness said it might have been more than that. `` And all the while, the senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was helping you get contracts with the government?'' <PERSON> Nessen </PERSON> asked later. `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, later saying that <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> `` was one of the most important people'' in helping <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> secure a multimillion-dollar <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract without competitive bidding. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` We have no knowledge of any secret contributions.'' He said prosecutors told <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> staffers there was `` a lot of false name-dropping going on'' at the trial. `` This is an example.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said he and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials contributed to the campaigns of Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, city Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON>, none of whom has been charged with wrongdoing. He said contributions were made to the Democratic, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Conservative parties, not because of political ideology but `` in exchange for favors we expected to get.'' Asked what favors <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> expected from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said, `` We expected to get the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in our pocket.'' `` By giving a check for $ 2,500?'' <PERSON> Nessen </PERSON> asked incredulously. `` By giving a lot of checks,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said without elaborating. `` What he refers to, I have no idea,'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state committee, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> office. `` If their -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials' -RRB- purpose was to get some sort of hook into us, God, we did n't know it,'' <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> said. `` I did n't know certain people gave to us until I saw it in the newspapers.''

<HEAD>GM, Government Differ On How To Fix Emission Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is being ordered to recall nearly 500,000 1985 vehicles for failure to meet federal air pollution standards, but the automaker and the government are at odds over how to fix the problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which announced the recall order Thursday, said a faulty thermal vacuum switch was part of the reason the vehicles' exhaust contains excess carbon monoxide and evaporated gasoline. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said the automaker told the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> it believed replacing the switch on the vehicles would be sufficient to bring emissions into compliance with federal standards. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, however, said its tests showed that `` replacement of the -LRB- switch -RRB- alone will not completely remedy the problem and that additional repairs may be necessary.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has 45 days either to request a public hearing to contest the order, or to submit a repair plan for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s approval before notices are mailed to owners. The vehicles affected by the recall are equipped with 5.0 liter -LRB- 305 cubic inches -RRB- and 5.7 liter -LRB- 350 cubic inches -RRB- engines, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. They were sold as the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Impala </ORGANIZATION>, Caprice Classic, Camaro, <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camino </ORGANIZATION>; the Pontiac Firebird, <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, Grand Prix and <LOCATION> Parisienne </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caballero </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Advocates for people who are hearing impaired say a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposal to require that more telephones be hearing-aid compatible does not go far enough. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday proposed to extend compatibility requirements to all credit-card operated phones and phones in common areas of a hearing-impaired employee's workplace. The agency said extending the requirement to all phones with existing technology would be unwise. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltz </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, an attorney for the National Center for Law and the Deaf at <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> action was not tough enough and that legislation still is needed to extend compatibility to all phones. `` I just do n't see those two areas -LRB- where the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> extended compatibility requirements -RRB- as nearly sufficient to meet the needs of equal access for the hearing impaired,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 400,000 Americans are expected to participate in a May 4 national program offering blood cholesterol tests. Hundreds of hospitals will offer free tests, while a few will charge $ 3. The program, organized by the Voluntary Hospitals of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was outlined Thursday at a news conference. Officials said they were announcing the national program well in advance to give people plenty of time to learn where they can go for testing for the fatty substance that is a leading contributor to heart disease and strokes. About 400 not-for-profit hospitals that are members of the association have agreed to participate. A public service television spot promoting the program, called `` CountDown <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' will begin airing next week. It includes a toll-free telephone number _ 800-634-9541 _ for people to call weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. -LRB- EST -RRB- to find out which hospitals in their areas will offer the testing.

<HEAD>Thousands Honor Slain Bishop; Alleged Conspirator Defends Election
Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people marched in memory of a slain archbishop while the man accused of ordering the clergyman's assassination defended his far-rightist party's nationwide election victory About 10,000 people joined in Thursday's march, which was called by student, labor, rights and church groups on the eighth anniversary of Monsignor <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s death. The bishop was shot through the heart by a sniper as he celebrated Mass at a chapel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The marchers carried flowers, large portraits of the bespectacled bishop and banners saying `` Monsignor <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> did not die in vain.'' They chanted calls for the prosecution an punishment of those responsible. In the weeks prior to his assassination, <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> called on members of the security forces to disobey orders to torture, kidnap and murder their countrymen. The late 1970s and early 1980s were a time of intense activity of Salvadoran death squads. In 1980, when <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was killed, the squads of soldiers, police and extremist anti-leftist civilians were blamed for killing more than 500 suspected leftists a month. No one was indicted in <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s slaying, but President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> late last year publicly accused <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a right-wing legislator and former army major, of masterminding the slaying. `` The case is solved. We know who did it, who ordered it, who drove the getaway car,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> told the country on nationwide television in November. He accused d'Aubuisson of issuing the order, and said testimony from the driver of the killer's car backed up his claim. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, the founder and a legislator for the far-rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, denies the charge. He says it is politically motivated slander. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for extradition of a Salvadoran army captain, <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>, who allegedly hired the sniper. <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>, arrested for a traffic violation, is in jail in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> pending resolution of the extradition request. Local authorities say it could be granted in the coming months. But whether the case will ever reach court is not clear. As a legislator, <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON> enjoys broad immunity from prosecution. His party was the big victor in Sunday's elections for all 60 members of the unicameral <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and municipal officials across this nation of 5 million. It is unlikely an Assembly controlled by <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>'s party would strip him of immunity to allow him to stand trial as an alleged conspiritor in <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s assassination. Early returns indicated <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> would hold an outright majority in the Assembly and most town and city posts nationwide. But on Wednesday, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> leaders charged the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> with manipulating returns in an effort `` to steal'' the right's parliamentary majority. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> and other Arena chiefs said violence could erupt if the vote count was flawed. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who had 33 seats in the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> but are expected to have fewer than 25 in the new one, deny the charge. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> had 13 seats in the old legislature. Talking with reporters Thursday, <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> was calmer than the previous day. But he insisted his party would not permit maneuvers to erode its electoral result. `` The people's will can not be subverted,'' he said. `` By tomorrow -LRB- Friday -RRB- afternoon we believe the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will be in a position to announce definitive official results that will confirm the triumph of our party.'' But there was no promise from the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that final results would be ready today. Council president <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> told reporters: `` We will take as long as is necessary to make sure the electoral law is fulfilled, whether certain parties or individuals like it or not.''

 An 18-year-old anti-nuclear activist charged today he was tortured for two days at the headquarters of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s security force and his companion was murdered. A spokesman for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said he was unaware of the allegations. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said he was willing to have authorities investigate the charge. <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> recounted his ordeal to reporters who interviewed him at a government hospital. He was recovering from a deep wound in the back of his neck doctors said must have been inflicted with a machete or an ax. The injury was similar to that which killed <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>'s companion, <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>, whose body was found by police Monday night in a field on the outskirts of the capital The field is near where a private security guard found <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>'s near-dead body hours earlier. Speaking in a low voice and unable to move his body, <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said an unidentified woman was also hacked that same night. Police have not reported finding any female body in the field. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said he, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> and five other members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalism </ORGANIZATION> were pasting up posters against nuclear arms and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases Saturday when about six armed men in a jeep chased them. He said the men, in civilian clothes, claimed they were police `` authorized by <PERSON> Malacanang </PERSON> -LRB- presidential palace -RRB-'' to arrest the youths. The men caught <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> and Francisco a few blocks away, but the others escaped. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> claimed he and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> were taken to a military compound behind the presidential palace, where he said they where they were handcuffed, blindfolded, interrogated and tortured. The compound houses the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` They wanted us to admit we were members of the Sparrow Unit, that we were <ORGANIZATION> NPA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said, referring to the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and its assassination unit. `` They kept asking us whether we killed such and such policeman or soldier.'' `` They beat us with iron rods and burned us with cigarettes,'' he said. Late Monday, <PERSON> Bustamente </PERSON> said three men drove him, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> and the woman to the field and hacked them. Deputy presidential spokesman <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gozo </PERSON> said he was unaware of <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>'s charges. `` We will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, but it sounds odd,'' <LOCATION> Gozo </LOCATION> said. `` We will have to check if it is a fact.'' De Villa called on <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> to provide evidence to back up his charge. `` I'm willing to have all these kinds of incidents investigated,'' he told reporters. `` We do not tolerate, we do not condone the use of torture. We are willing to subject our people to genuine investigation.'' Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> charged in a report released in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military was using torture and murder to fight the 19-year communist insurgency. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> called the report one-sided.

 When `` The Gospel at Colonus'' sings, it soars, raising the roof of Broadway's cavernous Lunt-Fontanne Theater and the spirits of everyone within shouting distance. There is n't a more joyous expression of song on Broadway, and that may be enough for some people. It's when the production stops to tell its tale that the show sags, marking time until the next musical explosion. This overlong gospel celebration, which opened Thursday, offers a sketchy and an often confusing version of Sophocles' `` Oedipus at Colonus,'' set within the framework of a rousing black Pentecostal church service. What little is left of the Greek tragedy in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuer </PERSON>'s adaptation is overwhelmed by religious fervor. Oedipus, in this version, comes to Colonus seeking redemption but is rejected at first by its citizens. When his prayers for forgiveness are heard by Theseus, king of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Oedipus </PERSON> and his two daughters <PERSON> Antigone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ismene </PERSON> are welcomed back to the holy city. The daughters are seized by <PERSON> Creon </PERSON>, king of <LOCATION> Thebes </LOCATION>, but then released after the intercession of Theseus. Oedipus then prepares for a happy death. <PERSON> Breuer </PERSON>, according to program notes, sees the show as a sermon or series of parables on fate, and much of the story is delivered between songs by a minister, played by <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. He's a commanding figure on stage but must muddle through the rudimentary narrative that rarely clarifies its characters. The real passion comes from the singers, many of them gospel music veterans, led by <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> and the Five Blind Boys of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. They all sing different facets of the role of Oedipus. Fountain has an ingratiating, swivel-hipped stage presence, a booming voice and sass to spare. He gets ample support from several other soloists and gospel groups including <PERSON> Jevetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> and the J.D. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> Singers and <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and the Soul Stirrers. The entire production is backed up by the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>, a Brooklyn-based church group. Its 30 members, dressed in colorful African robes, sit on bleachers that climb high above the stage. Large Greek columns, designed by <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Yerxa </PERSON>, rise behind them. The choir shouts its affirmation to much of <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s preaching, and their enthusiasm is infectious. The choir is the focal point of the evening's two show-stopping numbers _ `` No Never,'' a rousing hymn of welcome, and `` Lift Him Up,'' a song of redemption after <PERSON> Oedipus </PERSON> has gone peacefully to his death. The music by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Telson </PERSON> is melodic, just right for hand-clapping and toe-tapping, while <PERSON> Breuer </PERSON>'s lyrics are simple without being simplistic. <PERSON> Breuer </PERSON> also directed the musical, and he could have trimmed the show without diluting its impact. As it stands, `` The Gospel at Colonus'' is often a long wait between the hosannas. In other reviews: `` This is a show that never stops advertising its high-mindedness, whether in its program notes or on stage,'' writes <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` But happily, there is the music, too, and it is so rousing ... that the considerable spoken text ... can never completely upstage it. ... Even a cynic may feel that the tidal wave of music is lifting him to some higher, ecstatic plane.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> called the conception `` innovative and brilliant,'' although the show itself `` seemed somewhat longer than it should be ...'' But, he said, `` the power of this production can not be denied. There is no Broadway musical _ none _ that attains the rarefied heights that ` Gospel' does at its best.''

 Women who let sexually transmitted diseases go untreated run the risk of dangerous pregnancies, researchers say. Medical investigators at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> explored 22 possible problems they thought might lead to ectopic or tubal pregnancies, in which the fetus develops outside the womb. Their study is reported in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Ectopic pregnancies occur tens of thousands of times annually, and account for 10 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maternal deaths and are a major cause of infertility, the researchers said. They examined 274 cases of ectopic pregnancy diagnosed from 1935 to 1982 in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and compared the cases with 548 live-birth deliveries during the same period among similar women. One of four problems researchers identified more often among women with ectopic pregnancies was previous pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the upper genital tract that can result from untreated diseases of the lower tract. The study's lead authors, <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchbanks </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, said a history of venereal disease alone does not appear to increase ectopic pregnancy risk, but appears to increase risk if it advances to the upper genital tract. That means women have another good reason to seek medical help if they think they have a sexually transmitted disease, she said. Other problems in women with ectopic pregnancies were previous infertility for at least one year and having undergone reproductive surgery of the Fallopian tubes, the researchers said. And they found a strong association between conception while using an intrauterine birth control device and ectopic pregnancies. Women who had an ectopic pregnancy were 13.7 times more likely to have been using IUDs at the time of conception than women in the comparison group, the study said. A <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher not involved in the study, Dr. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, said that figure is inaccurate because it compares two groups that should n't be compared: women using birth control and women using no birth control. In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg lodges somewhere in the abdomen besides the womb. In 97 percent of cases, the site is in the Fallopian tubes, where as the fetus enlarges, it can rupture the tubes or cause severe bleeding. Though ectopic pregnancy is dangerous, it can now be detected early and the pregnancy ended surgically before damage makes a woman infertile, wrote Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, in an editorial accompanying the study.

<HEAD>Softball Players Would Get Hurt Less if Breakaway Bases Used</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Softball players would break considerably fewer bones if breakaway bases replaced anchored bags on recreational league diamonds, says a study published today. `` No system is foolproof, because poor technique can defeat a lot of safety measures,'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>, one of the study's four authors, said Thursday. `` But this is one place where we can do something almost immediately.'' Breakway bags could reduce injuries by more than 90 percent, according to the study published in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The study even contains some good news for baseball purists worried that using breakaway bases would detract from the game's tradition `` We did not have a single problem about an out call from either a player or an umpire in the more than 600 games we looked at,'' said <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>. `` Not only was there not one complaint, but we had a meeting of managers after the season, and virtually everybody said we had to have breakaway bases on the rest of the fields,'' he added. <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>, two colleagues from the orthopedic surgery section at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, and a director of the city's softball league gathered data from 633 softball games on diamonds that used breakaway bases and 627 games on stationary-base fields Stationary bases usually are anchored with a nut-and-bolt type arrangement in a tube driven into the ground. A set of three breakaway bases costs $ 295 vs. $ 150 for stationary bases. The breakaway bases used in the study had two parts: a rubber plate mounted flush with the ground and a base secured on top with suction and small rubber grommets that can pop loose. There were 45 sliding injuries, or about 7.2 per 100 games, on the stationary-base fields compared to two, or about 0.3 per 100 games, on the breakaway field _ a ratio of nearly 23-to-1. Medical costs for the 45 injuries totaled more than $ 55,000. Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON> of the Atlanta-based federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, took the numbers from the study and extrapolated them nationwide. `` If all games were played on stationary bases _ and we know they're not _ we could expect 1.7 million sliding injuries and medical costs over $ 2 billion,'' <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON> said. `` Put those same people on fields with breakaway bases and the numbers are just over 70,000 injuries and $ 24 million in medical costs,'' he said. <PERSON> Janda </PERSON> said his study revealed that most of the injuries resulted from `` things like not knowing how to slide, poor conditioning, late decision-making on when to slide, and even alcohol consumption.'' <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>, who described himself as `` a no-hit, no-field'' second baseman, declined to say how frequently alcohol figured into the equation. `` Nobody on our team drinks,'' he said, `` but we've played teams where everybody does.''

<HEAD>Late Medicaid Payments May Close Homes For Mentally Retarted</HEAD>

 Delays in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Medicaid payments could force private residential-care facilities to evict hundreds of mentally retarded patients in the coming months, officials say. `` If nothing changes, we will see 50 to 1,500 people discharged from community residential centers throughout the state,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mule </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> oundation, a home for retarded adults in <LOCATION> Lincolnshire </LOCATION>. Earlier this week <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> received a reimbursement check from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> for December, but is still owed at least $ 250,000 for care provided since then, <PERSON> Mule </PERSON> said. Another non-profit agency, <ORGANIZATION> Clearbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadows </LOCATION>, will have to close within three months if $ 446,000 owed by the state ca n't be found elsewhere, center president <PERSON> Guerin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. Reimbursements are slow now, and they're bound to get worse, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, state public aid director. `` I'm not choosing to do this, I'm running out of money,'' he said. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said because the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> underfunded the Medicaid program by $ 159 million last year, reimbursement money will run out. Requests received after April 15 wo n't be paid until July, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` We're working along with banks to help these agencies get credit lines,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` But the only real solution is more money.'' If the private homes are forced to evict their residents, the state would have to make room for them in already crowded facilities. `` We would have to put these people up on cots in gymnasiums,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Devane </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` They would be without programs, without any treatment that is not life sustaining.''

The Sonic Jacket, developed at <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> offices, is made of cotton and twill and has pockets in the front that house four C-size batteries and a cassette or CD player. Five feet of wires sealed by Velcro into the jacket's lining are connected to four speakers _ two low-frequency speakers in the lining of chest pockets and two `` tweeter-type'' speakers on the shoulders, <PERSON> Shoults </PERSON> said. The jacket, currently available in limited supplies, has detachable sleeves, comes in three sizes in white and black, and sells for $ 199.95. As clothing goes, the Sonic Jacket is not loud, <PERSON> Shoults </PERSON> said. `` This is intended to be personal electronics,'' he said. `` You ca n't really turn these things up so loud.

<HEAD>Latest Federal Surveys Find Increasing Public Knowledge About AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More Americans are learning about the causes of AIDS and discussing it with their kids, according to a new federal report. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, which launched its AIDS awareness interviews in August, reports that children are getting more education about AIDS at school and at home. The most notable changes between the November survey results _ the latest available _ and those from one month earlier `` were in the proportion of adults who reported having discussed AIDS with their children and who stated that their children had received AIDS education at school,'' the center reported. In November, 68 percent of those surveyed said they had discussed AIDS with their children ages 10-17. That was up 5 percent from October, and up 8 percent from August, according to the report, released Thursday by the center's parent agency, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Also in November, 51 percent of the adults surveyed said their kids had received AIDS instruction in school; that was up 6 percent from October, and 15 percent from August. Throughout the surveys, about one-third of the adults questioned did not know if their children had learned about acquired immune deficiency syndrome in school. The center also reported that public awareness about AIDS increased noticeably over the first four months of surveys. For example, in August, only 61 percent of the Americans surveyed by the center believed it very unlikely or impossible to get AIDS from shaking hands with a patient; in November, the percentage had risen to 70. And only 53 percent of those surveyed in August believed it very unlikely or impossible to get AIDS from working near someone who has it; by November, it was up to 61 percent. AIDS experts say the disease is not spread through such casual contact. AIDS, which had struck 57,024 Americans and killed 31,836 as of March 21, is spread most often through sex or shared drug needles. The 3,333 adults questioned in November were not the same group interviewed in previous months. The survey is designed with a margin of error no more than 1 percent.

 The research nuclear reactor at the center of a debate over whether <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has an atomic weapons program has been closed temporarily, but not because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, a top government official said today. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuang-chi </PERSON>, secretary general of the government <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the reactor is being converted to a system that no longer requires heavy water, which is used to control the splitting of atomic nuclei. Local newspapers have reported the military-run <ORGANIZATION> Chungshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> shut down the reactor at Lung Tan, 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government suspended delivery of heavy water. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration pressured <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to close the reactor and stop work on a secret installation that could have processed the reactor's spent fuel to extract plutonium, a key component of nuclear weapons `` The reactor was not closed because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said during a brief interview as he left a meeting with lawmakers. He declined comment on the report of a secret installation to process spent fuel. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said plans to convert the reactor are four years old and designed to make the facility compatible with the island's three nuclear power plants. He refused to elaborate. The reactor was closed in January for the remodification, according to <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, who would not say when the facility will restart. He said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> reported the plans to the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> last week. He refused to explain why the notification was made two months after the closure. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-lung </PERSON>, professor of physics of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the remodification plan was uneconomical. `` This is like buying a car and replacing its engine with one from another car,'' he said. Local newspapers, without disclosing their sources, have said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government learned from Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-yi </PERSON>, former deputy director of the institute's <ORGANIZATION> Nucleary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> had plans to make nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> has been missing since January, and local newspapers have claimed he is working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials say they do not know his whereabouts but are investigating the case. Government officials have reiterated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s position that it has not developed any nuclear weapons. Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said Taiwanese production of atomic weapons would be a reason for invading the island, which <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> views as a renegade province. Lawmaker Jaw Shau-kong of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today asked the government to lodge the `` strongest protest'' to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is found to be involved in Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can have nuclear weapons. Many other countries have their nuclear weapons,'' <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON> said at the Legislative Yuan, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s highest lawmaking body. `` We may not want to develop nuclear weapons, but we can not give up our high-technology research work because of this.'' Jaw said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> `` can never tolerate the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to recruit one of our colonels and then get him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' A day earlier, <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON> urged the government to ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to resume supplying heavy water so the Lung Tan reactor could continue production of isotopes used in certain X-ray techniques, cancer treatments and scientific research.

<TEXT>
 Police fears that a movie about <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> gangs might spark new violence when it is released next month show how out of control the problem is, its director says. `` I live in a gang area. I live in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> -LRB- Beach -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, director of `` Colors,'' said recently. The film, starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> as policemen fighting gang drug dealing and street crime, drew fire from real law enforcement officers who were given a preview. The movie, scheduled for release in mid-April, features graphic depictions of gang violence, including a gang drive-by shooting and the killing of a police character by gang members. Several detectives said the film glamorizes the gang lifestyle and could trigger violence among gang audiences. Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> suggested it be banned. <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, best known for his acting in such films as `` Easy Rider,'' `` Apocalypse Now,'' `` Hoosiers,'' and `` Blue Velvet,'' said the official reaction shocked him. He said banning the movie would be `` like burning books ... And they wanted to burn it before it could even be seen or read.'' `` What they're basically saying is that they have a police problem and they ca n't handle it,'' <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON> said. `` The gang thing is out of control.'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> defended his use of real gang members as extras and the realistic presentation of gang dominance in many <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighborhoods, using some statistics in the film to show what police are up against. `` At the beginning we point out that there are 250 men and women in law enforcement working against 600 gangs with over 70,000 members,'' he said. `` How can they possibly handle it?''

 Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> predicted today that his struggling presidential bid would be revitalized by a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> victory and dismissed reports that he would opt to run for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> if he loses here. `` I think we're going to turn this race back around here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' show. `` We're going to get back in the middle of this thing and I'm going to go ahead and win.'' Asked why he was planning to file for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat by <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s Tuesday deadline, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> replied: `` No decision on that at all. ... I'm going to be the nominee. I'm going to be the next president.'' But before a crowd of laid-off auto workers, enthusiastic about his call for tough foreign trade policies, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on Thursday acknowledged his presidential candidacy is in need of extraordinary help from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrats. `` This Saturday we're going to have a miracle in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> miracle,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said, mimicking <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his description of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' economic turnaround during his three interrupted terms as governor. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is running third in the polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. After suffering major losses across the South and elsewhere on Super Tuesday two weeks ago, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> launched a major effort to climb back into contention with the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> contest. Aside from winning his home state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday, his only other victories have been in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s lead-off caucus. Aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was making plans to file for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> by the deadline Tuesday if <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> does not give him the victory he seeks. `` That's right. He will be out if does n't win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said a campaign aide who would not be quoted by name. Asked about the aide's comment, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said: `` No. I'm running for president and I've doing very well here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. ... I'm going to win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> I'm going to continue and do well. `` My mother always told me to cross one bridge at a time. That's what I'm trying to do,'' he said His wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> reinforced the notion that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was a do-or-die state for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> has to come in first or a real strong second to remain in the race, because at some point if you do n't do well here, it becomes difficult to raise money,''' she said. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s message will be very popular in the industrial states, but if we do n't do well here, we will not be able to continue. In <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spoke in a roped-off street between a union hall and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Body </PERSON> assembly plant that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> shut down last December, leaving an already reduced work force of 3,500 workers without jobs. The plant manufactured large, rear-wheel drive <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> autos. Many of the several hundred people present carried signs saying they were unemployed auto workers. A billboard above the union hall said, `` There is hope,'' and was signed by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> 581 <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` While it may be cloudy and a little gloomy here today, what we're going to do in 1988 is we're going to win an election for the presidency and we're going to bring the sun back out in the American economy,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. He repeated his familiar call for tough trade sanctions against countries that do not open markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, and resumed his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for changing positions on trade policy. He said he welcomed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recently announced support for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would toughen trade policies, and then added: `` I just hope he does n't change his trade policy again after leaving <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.''

 A motorist whose car was mistakenly towed from a service station searched frantically for three days before he found his prized <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> _ in a junkyard pile. `` It was squished, just like a little metal cube,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraca </PERSON> said Thursday. `` All the wheels and the doors were gone. It was about 20 inches high.'' <PERSON> Geraca </PERSON> took his last ride in the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> on March 11, when he went to the service station to pick up the Cadillac he had dropped off for a tuneup, police said. After paying the bill for the work, <PERSON> Geraca </PERSON> drove away in the Cadillac and left his red Chevy behind in the parking lot, intending to pick it up later, police said. But it was gone when he returned after two hours. Another red Chevy, this one a 1976 Impala, was still in the parking lot, however. The owner of that car had asked that it be junked, and no one at the station noticed when the tow truck picked up the wrong car. `` I guess he just pulled up, hooked up on a Chevy and away he went,'' said station attendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>. `` He did n't ask anybody about it.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> junkyard, said it was an honest mistake because the description of the two red Chevys was identical. `` Right about now, they're probably making Toyotas out of it,'' said <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, one of four people arrested on racketeering and theft charges last week at the culmination of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police investigation of suspected chop shops. `` We're completely honest here, and all we're trying to do is make an honest buck,'' <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> said. `` We do n't steal cars.'' Scrap cars fetch about $ 25 at a junkyard. Police said <PERSON> Geraca </PERSON>'s car was worth about $ 1,000 Investigators have told <PERSON> Geraca </PERSON>, who says the car held $ 16,000 worth of marine electronics equipment, that the case is a civil matter, <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanrahan </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Rescue workers struggled through the night to free victims trapped in the crushed cars of two passenger trains that crashed head-on outside <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, killing at least 28 people and injuring 109. Chinese officials said today that 27 Japanese high school students and one Chinese passenger died in Thursday's accident. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone that 37 students from <ORGANIZATION> Gakugei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kochi </LOCATION> prefecture and 72 Chinese passengers remained hospitalized. Ten other Japanese from the 193-member school tour group were treated for injuries and released, said <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatao </PERSON>, a Foreign Affairs spokesman. It was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fourth fatal train collision this year, bringing the total death toll to 169. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said the cause of the crash was still under investigation. <PERSON> Bundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takagi </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Second Consular Division, said a team of three Japanese doctors will leave for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Saturday morning to assist in the treatment of injured students. The school group arrived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on March 21 for a tour of the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> area and the nearby city of <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>. The crash occurred at 2 p.m. Thursday when train No. 311, carrying the Japanese group, ignored a stop signal as it left <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> station for <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> and smashed into the southbound train No. 208 arriving from <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Fengban </LOCATION>. The Japanese group was traveling in the first-class cars in the front of No. 311. The cars were knocked off the track along with the baggage car of No. 208. <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> said the trains were not traveling at high speeds at the time of the crash. Chinese officials responded last month to the string of transportation disasters by demanding greater attention to safety. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s railway minister was forced to resign to take responsibility for three fatal train accidents in January.

 Efforts to educate minorities about AIDS have failed to stop the deadly disease because they have largely ignored differing customs and languages, witnesses told a presidential commission. Most black men with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> are homosexual or bisexual, yet have been nearly untouched by efforts to halt the spread of the disease among white gay men, said <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston-Hamilton </PERSON>, chairwoman of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS. `` We believe these men have fallen through the cracks,'' <PERSON> Houston-Hamilton </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic. `` They are dying alone, frequently coming for medical services when they are too sick to walk, incontinent, demented,'' said <PERSON> Houston-Hamilton </PERSON>, one of a panel of Asian, Hispanic, Native American and hemophiliac leaders who testified Thursday as the commission began a three-day visit here. `` There are 32 distinct Asian ethnic groups, with different languages, cultures, traditions and customs. These differences have been been largely overlooked by AIDS education programs,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja </PERSON>, of the San Francisco-based Asian AIDS Project. The group represents the Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese communities and runs the only Asian AIDS education program in the nation with $ 230,000 in federal funds and a staff of six. <PERSON> Lillis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, of the Sacramento-based <ORGANIZATION> Hemophilia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that of the state's 2,300 hemophiliacs, at least 1,600 are infected with the virus, an infection level exceeding that of gay and bisexual people in the state. An estimated 10 to 20 percent of sexual partners of infected hemophiliac men infected are also infected with the AIDS virus, according to surveys by the organization. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimate 53 cases of AIDS among Native Americans nationally, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsley </PERSON>, a community leader, contended the number is much higher and will mushroom as a result of a 20.8 percent teen-age pregnancy rate and the nation's highest levels of drug abuse <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> gay activist and former co-chair of the National Mobilization Against AIDS, told the commission it should use its influence against those who claim the virus justifies discrimination against homosexuals. `` The AIDS epidemic will not destroy our liberation movement, but attempts to misuse the fear of AIDS to suppress us will be very destructive to social peace,'' he said. The testimony will be considered by the full 14-member commission, which is about two-thirds of the way through its national tour. The commission will deliver its recommendations for a national strategy to stop AIDS to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by June 24, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Acting Premier Calls For Reform At Annual Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> today told delegates to the annual session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must emphasize reform as it continues on its path of economic development. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s report to the 2,970 delegates of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature also said that in the next five years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will maintain its policies of market-oriented reforms, opening itself to the outside world and making its political system more democratic. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, 59, is expected to be confirmed as head of government at the legislative session, which will last 20 days. With his report, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> displayed his full support, at least publicly, for the reforms set in motion by his protege, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. In the next five years, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must `` put reform at the center of all our undertakings and integrate it more closely with economic development so that the two are coordinated and promote each other.'' Veteran military leader <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, 81, an ally of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, is likely to replace <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, 79, in the largely ceremonial post of president. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 83, who entered semi-retirement last fall at a major <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting, sat on the podium between <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the former premier who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The delegates also are expected to pass laws giving greater authority to factory managers. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a Soviet-trained technocrat regarded as being cautious toward reforms, also sounded several conservative themes on economic problems in his speech, the keynote address of the congress. Among those problems, he said, are rising prices, `` the outstanding problem in our economic and social life today,'' inadequate investment on agriculture, and economic crimes committed by those seeking personal gains. In the past five years, reforms have brought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an annual growth rate of 11.1 percent, provided jobs for 37 million people, substantially raised living standards and opened <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to foreign investment and trade, he said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> outlined 10 objectives for the next five years, led by the need for further reforms in agriculture. Chinese leaders have been concerned about stagnating grain production as farmers switch to more lucrative cash crops, and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> stressed that more money and effort must be spent to `` mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for agricultural production.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also stressed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must revitalize its enterprises by instituting contract systems for managers and reducing government interference in factories. Heading the legislation to be passed at the congress is an industrial enterprise law to guarantee the rights of managers to operate their factories without interference. He hit hard on the problem of rising prices and said inflation must be fought by reforming the irrational, heavily subsidized pricing system and expanding supplies while controlling some prices. Officially, inflation was 7.3 percent last year, but prices in most larger cities rose at double-digit rates. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> mentioned March 5 anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk-led demonstrators `` violated the law and undermined the unity of the motherland. The rioters must be severely punished.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> officials have promised that the session will be the most open ever, with foreign journalists allowed to attend some of the legislature's discussion groups as well as the opening and closing sessions. Access to the discussions is part of the government attempt to show the outside world that the congress, long belittled as a rubber-stamp body for policies set by the party, has become more democratic and influential. All major decisions are still made by the party Politburo and its standing committee, but under outgoing <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON>, 86, the body has gained some stature as a forum to debate, and sometimes revise, policies handed down by the party.

But <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said he still does n't think <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has been truthful about surrendering all his assets, as stipulated in the plea bargain the former mayor made with the government Jan. 6. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has turned over $ 1.4 million to the government, but <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> alleged during Thursday's hearing that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is hiding $ 200,000 and has lied about other kickbacks. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 60, who spent 16 years as mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest city, had faced up to 30 years in prison for his admission to charges of racketeering, conspiracy to obstruct a government investigation and tax evasion But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAvoy </PERSON> followed the sentencing recommendation made by prosecutors. `` I've brought great pain to my loved ones and the people of my city and stand here now ready for my punishment,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said at the close of a 10-minute statement he gave before his sentence was pronounced. `` The punishment you are about to impose on me ... pales against the pain and remorse I feel.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was indicted July 16, 1987, by a special grand jury empaneled 18 months earlier to investigate public corruption in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> initially denied the charges. But he sought a plea bargain after being faced with evidence the government had gathered, including testimony from <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s bagmen and other co-conspirators. He admitted running the extortion-kickback scheme during his four terms as <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> mayor between 1970 and 1986. A 40-count federal grand jury indictment charged that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> extorted kickbacks of up to 25 percent from businessmen, professionals and consultants doing work in the city. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> will be eligible for parole after about 40 months, but <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> will serve at least five years. He must surrender by April 14. Also Thursday, seven co-conspirators were sentenced to terms ranging up to 2 -LCB- years.

<HEAD>Mubarak Warns Against Israeli Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has warned that an Israeli attack on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s new intermediate-range missile launchers would `` blow up the entire peace process'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said Thursday he had sent an urgent message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging him to `` use his influence with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and urge it to stop threatening <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in this irresponsible way.'' He said he also sent a verbal message to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> via <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON>. The Egyptian president said other senior Israeli officials also had been contacted. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s remarks to local reporters was <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s second sharp response to Israeli warnings about <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s Chinese-supplied CSS-2 missiles. On Wednesday, an unidentified Egyptian official said <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> would consider any Israeli attack on the installations an attack on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> itself. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s comments were distributed by the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` I warn against any attack on ... <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which is a sister and friendly country,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` This is a grave, grave matter. If an attack on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> occurred, it would blow up the entire peace process.'' <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also have said they would regard an Israeli attack on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> as aggression against them. The Egyptian warning, however, appeared to carry greater weight because of its 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the only one between an Arab country and the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> also is the Arab world's strongest military power. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> recently acquired the missiles, which have a range of 2,200 miles, enough to reach <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have given assurances they will be fitted only with conventional warheads. After disclosure of the missile deal, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was reported to have told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the Saudis must get rid of them. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted close <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> as referring to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reputation not to let potential dangers become actual ones, an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1981 air raid on a nuclear reactor being built in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said later that <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> denied making the statement, but the premier said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were `` making efforts to deal with ... the grave development.''

 Two defense contractors and five executives are facing charges of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, one by faking test results on electronics for a missile system, the other by selling reconditioned aircraft parts as new. <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and its top two officers were charged Thursday with one count of conspiracy and four of submitting false claims about hydraulic parts provided under a $ 1 million contract beginning in 1984. Another indictment accused <ORGANIZATION> Genisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> and one current and two former executives of conspiracy and falsely certifying that sensing devices used in air-to-ground missiles and helicopters had been tested. `` Fraud in defense procurement and in the production of strategic and military hardware is the No. 1 ` white collar' crime priority of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Feess </PERSON>, chief assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The parts in the Consolidated contract were destined for use in the steering systems of A-7, F-4 and F-104 jet fighters, the B-52 bomber and the C-141 transport plane. The hydraulic parts were certified by the company as new but actually had been refurbished, the indictment alleged. All the parts that have been tested failed, and flight crews could have been endangered had the parts been used, officials said. Consolidated could be fined $ 3.5 million if convicted. Also charged were <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Strube </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, Consolidated president and chief executive officer, and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, vice president of sales. Telephone calls to the company went unanswered Thursday. If convicted, <PERSON> Strube </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 7 -LCB- years in prison and fined up to $ 1.25 million; Guy faces up to 15 years in prison and a $ 750,000 fine. The <ORGANIZATION> Genisco </ORGANIZATION> contract was worth several hundred thousand dollars a year, <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Genisco </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum $ 7.5 million fine. <ORGANIZATION> Genisco </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> suggested that any wrongdoing was the fault of officers and former officers of the company's transducer products division in <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and he called indictment of the company unwarranted Also charged were <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkschulte </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, former general manager of the division; <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, former division supervisor, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kersnick </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Sepulveda </LOCATION>, quality assurance manager of the division.

<HEAD>One Year Later, Heidnik To Go To Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year ago today, police discovered three half-naked women chained in a north <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> basement and limbs of another in the house's freezer. A grisly tale unfolded of how they were kept prisoners, one for four months. The trail led to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> forest where the naked body of another woman was found. The man who lived in the house, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, 41, faces trial April 4 on rape and murder charges in a case that has already attracted the attention of authors and could lead to a movie. Any profits from such a venture can not go to <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> if he is convicted, and at a federal bankruptcy court hearing Wednesday, attorneys debated what should be done with the money. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said two-thirds of the profits should be assigned to the estates of <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> and a sect he started, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the Ministers of God. If <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> were convicted, the money would then go to his victims. Both <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> and the church are in bankruptcy. `` If I bring in money to enhance the estates, I get one-third of what I enhance,'' <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said. `` The estates would get two-thirds.'' As part of the agreement, the lawyer would not get any legal fees for defending <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumberg </PERSON> argued the state's victim compensation law provides that 100 percent of such book or movie profits goes to the victims `` If anything in the book contains any thoughts, feelings, impressions of Mr. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, that belongs to the victims,'' she said. At least two of the women are undergoing psychiatric treatment. <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 27, a prostitute who police say was held by <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> the longest _ four months _ and who escaped to notify police, still is undergoing periodic counseling. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 20, another captive, continues to undergo weekly psychiatric counseling. <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> `` Tony'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s retarded friend who is charged with assisting him in the house, recently got married. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 32, who is free on bail and has been cooperating with police, on Nov. 13 married <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincow </PERSON>, 37, a mildly retarded woman who had been a friend and, police say, a temporary prisoner of <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s.

 This <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate found and retrieved an armed power launch apparently abandoned by the Iranians in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The craft, with a twin-barrel 25mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on its bow and protected by a canvas, was brought alongside the USS <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> in a tense, three-hour operation hampered by high seas Thursday. The find could advance American knowledge of how the Iranians operate in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` I'm not sure what all this is going to lead to in the way of intelligence,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieley </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, skipper of the <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. `` But I think it will go a long way in helping us to understand the kind of thing that goes on out here.'' The captain repeatedly tried to approach the boat late Thursday with his 443-foot frigate when it was found about 12 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> at the entrance to the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. But seas up to 10 feet and strong winds made maneuvering difficult, and the Irananian boat disappeared into the darkness until it was relocated two hours later. Two seamen was finally lowered onto the deck of the Iranian boat from a helicopter hovering overhead. `` I was scared,'' said eight-year <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 24, of <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, one of the lowered seamen. `` I did n't know what to expect, whether it was booby trapped or whether to look for someone lying down on the boat or what.'' Lines were attached, and the Iranian craft was tied to the frigate's stern for towing. Its rusty but functioning anti-aircraft gun had ammunition boxes attached and was ready for firing. Spent shells littered the floor of the boat, along with several sealed boxes of ammunition, cans of diesel fuel and other items. The area where the ship was found is close to main shipping lanes where tankers and other commercial vessels are frequently attacked by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval frigates and armed patrol boats.

 The suicides of three teen-age boys in two weeks have shocked students and faculty at a high school here, but they are trying to avert further tragedies with a vigorous counseling program, including teen advisers. `` It's a scary situation,'' said <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 18, one of several students receiving training as a peer group counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Reitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after the suicides. `` Even people who did n't know them are affected by it.'' More than 600 parents and students attended a meeting at the school auditorium Thursday night to talk about the deaths, the latest of which occurred Wednesday morning. `` We're concerned about the families it happened to,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elfreich </PERSON>, whose daughter is a freshman at <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON>. `` I'm not really worried about more -LRB- suicides -RRB-, but you just ca n't predict things like that.'' Along with the peer counseling groups, <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Settle </PERSON> said the school would begin a `` buddy system'' to pair newcomers with older students. In addition, six school psychologists and two counselors were sent to the school of 1,350 students on Wednesday to assist the four counselors normally assigned to <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON>. `` I hope all this helps,'' Miss <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. `` People have come to me to talk, but they're afraid to tell their parents because they know they'll get sent to get help. And then they'll have to come back -LRB- to school -RRB- and have people tell them, ` Well, we know you're crazy now.' So it's a lot easier for them to talk to us.'' <LOCATION> Vanderburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> told the audience that an investigation had turned up no connection between the deaths and satanism or cults, despite rumors to that effect. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said before the meeting that `` all three were immediate, personal, emotional problems with the young men. One was a boyfriend-girlfriend problem, and the others were family problems.'' The three victims were boys who knew each other and were in the same year in high school, the sheriff said. Two were <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> sophomores, and the third was a former student who transferred to another school. The latest victim, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Orth </PERSON>, 15, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> left a note indicating he was having family problems. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 16 and also a <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> student, died March 10; and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, 15, who left last year, died March 13. Both <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> also shot themselves. The school system began a weeklong spring vacation today, and school officials hoped the break would help settle the students. `` They will still see their friends, but they wo n't be together in one building and rumors wo n't be spreading as much,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, head of psychological services for the <ORGANIZATION> Evansville-Vanderburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think that will help,'' she added. The suicide rate for those ages 15 to 24 more than doubled, from 5.2 per 100,000 in 1960 to 12.5 in 1984, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>.

 Red Army troops patrolled the tense Armenian capital today to enforce a ban on public demonstrations by Armenians locked in a violent territorial dispute with neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin took a series of decisive steps to quell the ethnic violence, which has claimed more than 30 lives and posed a serious challenge to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Soldiers and helicopters were deployed to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, to prevent the kind of massive demonstrations staged by Armenians to demand the return of the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region that is now part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Demonstrations had been planned for Saturday, but Armenian activists reported they had been called off. Armenian activists reported that authorities have ordered disbanded an Armenian committee that spearheaded the drive to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The government on Thursday announced an eight-year plan to build more housing, roads, schools and social services in the disputed region, where nearly 75 percent of the population of 160,000 is Armenian. The Kremlin has accused the demonstrators of being extremists and demanded an end to the Armenian protest actions as `` intolerable.'' The demonstrations led to retaliation aganst Armenians in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, where at least 32 people were killed and nearly 200 injured. Sources in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that the atmosphere was tense, but they reported no outbreaks of violence. Western reporters have not been allowed to visit the area. <PERSON> Hovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON>, an activist in the protest, said the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> newspaper announced today that the committee to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was being disbanded `` because it was working against the people's interests.'' <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said the planned demonstrations Saturday `` wo n't happen. He said they have been called off `` considering the situation.'' Armenians, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, have been demanding that the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabkh </LOCATION> region, which is smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, be annexed to the neighboring Armenian republic, though there is no common border. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is overwhelmingly Moslem. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan for <PERSON> Nagorno-Karabkh </PERSON> also assures the local population that television transmission will be upgraded so they can receive broadcasts in Armenian as well as the national network and Azeri programming. Other assurances, such as better supplies of Armenian-language books and preservation of historical and cultural monuments, address issues that incited Armenians to demand annexation for the mountainous region, which has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. In <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baku </ORGANIZATION> reported today that public assemblies, meetings and street demonstrations will be allowed only by permits, which must be applied for at least 10 days in advance. Those violating the order face criminal penalties, according to the broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> instituted a similar ban on unsanctioned demonstrations earlier in the week, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yerevan </ORGANIZATION>. It was not immediately clear whether the government plan would succeed in pacifying Armenians worried that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is losing its ethnic identity. But one official source in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> reported a generally quiet, though tense, atmosphere today. A duty officer at the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for police operations, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that the city was `` fairly quiet.'' The officer, who declined to give his name or detailed information, confirmed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and security troops were patrolling the capital to keep order. Calls to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> did not go through today. Moscow-based dissidents reported Thursday that the atmosphere in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was `` filled with tension.'' On Wednesday, the Soviet government rejected as `` intolerable'' the Armenian campaign for annexation, indicating it would not bend to pressure brought on by mass demonstrations and strikes in the republic last month. The unrest brought an unusual personal appeal from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for calm and reason in dealing with the ethnic dispute. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also promised the leadership would review <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s claims to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address calmed the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. But on Feb. 28, ethnic extremists went on a rampage of murder, rape, robbery and other crimes in the Azeri city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>.

 This small, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town has been chosen as the focus of a $ 4 million, two-year, privately funded study aimed at reducing heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure, officials said. Sponsors of the pilot program said they chose <LOCATION> Wellsburg </LOCATION> because of its small population _ 4,000 _ and because <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> registered the highest obesity rate in the country at 24 percent in a 1986 federal study that also found 31 percent of West Virginians smoke cigarettes. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> trails only <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in the annual death rate from heart disease, according to state Health Director Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Heydinger </PERSON>. `` Education, especially health education, is lacking in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON>, administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the program's advisory board. The program, one of the first privately funded public health education programs aimed at rural areas, is sponsored by The <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an aspirin and over-the-counter drug manufacturer, and <ORGANIZATION> Glenbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION>'s New York-based parent. However, aspirin, recently linked to the prevention of heart attacks and strokes, will not be part of the program, said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We already have ongoing research into that,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. `` What we want to develop is a health program that we can offer to rural Americans.'' The program will begin in May when 1,000 volunteers will be checked for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors. Participants must be at least 21 years old and willing to return for checkups every three months over a two-year period. Health professionals will attempt to lower the weight, cholesterol and blood pressure of participants and eliminate other risk factors through education and behavior modification. Some aspects of the study, including nutrition seminars, weight reduction techniques and smoking clinics will be available to all of the town's 4,000 people, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. The company will also sponsor walks, runs and other exercise activities for the town, which is about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` If people listen, it will be a good thing,'' said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, 46, owner of <PERSON> Nora </PERSON>'s Novelty Nook, as she smothered a cigarette in a full ashtray. `` I'd go crazy if I had to quit smoking and I do n't have to lose weight, but I'll probably check it out,'' she said. Cardiovascular disease _ the leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ kills nearly a million Americans each year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly one-fifth of those deaths occur in people under the age of 65.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fired on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators who hurled rocks and broken bottles in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today, killing two and wounding six, hospital officials and witnesses said. The army said five protesters were wounded in the attack on a makeshift army headquarters in <LOCATION> Tarqumia </LOCATION> and in a clash in the nearby city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. It said it was investigating the reports that two were killed. Officials close to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> protested a meeting planned Saturday between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and two Palestinian-Americans tied to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. As part of a campaign to crack down on leaders of recent unrest, the army arrested a prominent <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer under special laws allowing detention for up to six months without trial. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted an unidentified military source as saying the military had evidence that the attorney, <PERSON> Raji </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourani </PERSON>, was linked to the organization of the uprising. The army has not commented. More than 4,000 Palestinians have been detained since the unrest began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and 3,000 remain in jail. But unlike previous roundups, which focused on stone-throwers, the current one has zeroed in on the underground leadership. In <LOCATION> Tarqumia </LOCATION>, a village of 9,000 near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, hundreds of stone-throwing youths set out before dawn to attack a school that troops had turned into makeshift headquarters, said <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON>, a 52-year-old schoolteacher. `` The troops came into the village at 4 a.m. and took over the school,'' <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> said. `` Then about 500 youths marched out to the school and started throwing rocks and broken bottles.'' Troops responded by opening fire, <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> said, and the confrontation lasted several hours. He said two youths were shot and killed. Villagers and an official at <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> hospital identified the dead as <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Murktan </PERSON>, 18, who was shot in the stomach, and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatatta </PERSON>, 18, who was shot in the chest. <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> said the bodies were buried in the town's cemetery. There, villagers pointed out to a journalist two freshly dug mounds of earth, with an inscribed rock beside them. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, soldiers surrounded <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haras </PERSON> mosque following noon prayers on the Moslem Sabbath when 20 youths took up positions on the roof and began throwing stones and waving a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, which is outlawed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. As a reporter watched from a nearby vantage point, troops fired tear gas and the sound of shots also could be heard. Three protesters were shot and critically wounded, the Arab-owned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Later, three Arab teen-agers were seen sitting on the ground with their hands tied behind their backs. A soldier was seen kicking one of the young men, who was wearing a blue sweater. The army said an empty passenger bus headed for the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Qiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> was surrounded by residents of an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> village, who beat the driver and set the vehicle on fire. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the driver was hospitalized with two broken arms. Israeli officials reacted angrily to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plans to meet with two Palestinian-American members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. The officials said the meeting violated a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment not to talk to the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Organizaton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lughod </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, were to discuss the latest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace initiative with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the prime minister planned to raise the issue today with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Ambassdor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, a senior legislator from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said he was `` very upset about this because they are not just Americans; they are members of a group the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has promised not to talk to.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. The Palestinian death toll in the violence is 109, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed.

 In the heady days following his Southern victories, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> depicted rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as having the electoral appeal of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. Two weeks later, the harsh rhetoric is gone. With recent polls showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ not <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ as the only Democrat running even nationwide with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is having a more difficult time pinning his rival with the image of the Democrats' landslide losers of 1972 and 1984 <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who needs a victory in the North to remain a top contender, has hardly mentioned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or his other rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination as he campaigns in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Instead, he is focusing on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in a slight retooling of his new populist message. His silence on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has caused some to speculate about <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s intentions _ whether he is holding his fire against a candidate who could, as nominee, offer him the second spot on the ticket <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> maintains he has `` no interest'' in the vice presidential nomination _ a statement that stops short of ruling it out. There are also suggestions <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> may be awaiting a better opportunity to engage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, when the field has narrowed and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> can find a state where he does not speak from a position so far behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that his remarks seem born of desperation. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> catapulted to the top tier of Democratic presidential contenders through his victories in the South and West on Super Tuesday, March 8. Two days after that, campaigning in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' primary, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delivered a strong assault on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as representing the Democrats' past losing formula. `` For those who want another election blow-out, and see the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> losing 49 out of 50 states, vote for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said then. `` How long will it take for us to learn the approach that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> represents does not sell to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people?'' he asked. Campaigning this week across <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s sparsely populated <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was asked why he is not continuing that language, and did he no longer think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be a `` blow-out'' loser. `` I said that the approach he represents runs that risk,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> responded. `` I'm not going to say any of my opponents are not electable. `` I think the recent history suggests there are only two kinds of elections in modern history _ Republican landslides or Democratic squeakers. This is going to be a Democratic squeaker.'' When he was pinning his hopes on appeal among the South's independent and conservative-minded Democrats, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> argued that he is the most electable Democrat Two polls this week _ one by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the other by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> _ both showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a virtual dead heat. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, meanwhile, was far behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when paired against the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> now refers to the `` electability'' issue as one of importance primarily to the Democratic `` super delegates,'' the nearly 650 elected officials who will get delegate berths and be free agents at the convention, unbound by primary or caucus results in their states. He still contends he has demonstrated an appeal to swing voters that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have not. But he usually couples it with an acknowledgement that it is more an issue for party insiders than average voters. `` Many Democrats, particularly the so-called super delegates, are interested in finding a candidate who has the best chance of winning in the fall, the best chance of appealing to the independently thinking voters who hold the balance of power, the best chance of carrying areas like the South, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where we have lost overwhelmingly these last several elections,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I think it's a legitimate question to ask _ who can best win.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> disputed the answer presented in the recent polls, saying it is too early to measure such sentiment accurately. `` Hypothetical matchups of that kind ... are entirely meaningless,'' he said.

<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Socialist Labor leader <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON>, a staunch defender of independence for this British colony, was declared the victor today in local elections. <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON>, who rejects a competing Spanish claim of sovereignty over the fortress colony at its southern tip, received 8,128 votes, or 58 percent of the votes cast Thursday. Incumbent Chief Minister <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON> was next with 4,442 votes, or 29 percent, in the most lopsided victory ever by a <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> party. The incumbent leads the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which had long dominated <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> politics. The party of <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON>, branch officer of the 7,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, won eight seats in the 15-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON>'s party won the other seven. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by former civil servant <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitaluga </PERSON> got 13 percent of the vote, but none of its candidates won enough votes to gain a seat. In his first comments to reporters after the victory, <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> asserted that most of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>'s 29,000 residents reject a 1984 British-Spanish accord known as the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> agreement. Under that accord, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the first time said it would discuss the question of sovereignty with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ceded <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the 1713 Treaty of <ORGANIZATION> Utrecht </ORGANIZATION> following its defeat in the War of Succession. The treaty stipulates that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> recover sovereignty over the territory if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> relinquishes it. <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON> is a protege of longtime party leader and <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> Chief Minister <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, who governed the colony for 40 of the last 43 years. In campaigning for <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> of being a radical who would harm <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> said he intended to better relations with both countries. Presiding senior election officer <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> said 13,473 votes were cast, representing just over 76 percent of the colony's 17,500 registered voters. The highest previous turnout had been 74 percent in 1984 elections.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today it hammered <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> with missiles and shellfire and repulsed an Iraqi counterattack in the northern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains, killing or wounding 500 men Both sides claimed to have shot down four jets, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed it attacked two ships off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coast in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Revolutionary Guards in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> pushed back four infantry battalions and a brigade _ about 7,200 troops _ that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> moved up from its southern 7th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to reinforce the northern front. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the fighting centered around the <LOCATION> Rishan </LOCATION> mountains east of the town of <LOCATION> Sayyid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sadiq </LOCATION>. Iranian forces, estimated at around 30,000 men, were reported Thursday to be five miles east of the town, a strategic transport hub, after punching 10 miles into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in an offensive launched March 16. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported four Iraqi fighter-bombers were shot down by ground fire today and the pilots killed. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said four U.S.-built Iranian F-5 jets were shot down by Iraqi anti-aircraft fire over the battle zone. It said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> fighters destroyed four Iranian helicopters on the ground. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, quoting military communiques, said <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> jets carried out 14 attacks on Iraqi troop concentrations in the northeastern battle zone and around <LOCATION> al-Amarah </LOCATION> in the south. It said all the planes returned safely to their bases. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s air force flew 224 combat missions Thursday. That was one of the highest one-day totals in the last year and underlined the growing intensity of the current fighting. The newspaper said the planes dropped nearly 200 tons of bombs and destroyed three Iranian jets and two helicopters. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said six missiles were fired during the night into the strategically important city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the border town of <LOCATION> Mandali </LOCATION>, 80 miles east of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The agency said long-range artillery also pounded `` military, economic and industrial centers'' in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the border town of al-Gharbi farther north. There was no immediate word on casualties. In recent weeks, hundreds of civilians on both sides have been killed or wounded in missile, air and artillery attacks in the so-called `` war of the cities.'' The Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi fighter-bombers attacked two `` large maritime targets,'' which usually means tankers, off the Iranian coast during the night. It reported `` accurate and effective hits.'' There was no immediate independent confirmation of the ship attacks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said 13 people were killed and 68 wounded Thursday when two Iranian missile crashed into downtown <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Among the victims was a woman, killed in a hospital bed while breast-feeding her newborn baby, <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The infant was found alive in his mother's arms several hours later. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired six long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said 10 civilians were killed and 100 wounded when the missiles hit two schools, two mosques and two hospitals as well as shops and houses. Both sides have fired more than 250 missiles into each other's cities since Feb. 29, when <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was hit by long-range <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles for the first time in the war <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Thursday that its troops advanced further into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s northeastern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> province It claims to have killed or wounded 11,000 Iraqis, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200 tanks and armored vehicles in the 10-day offensive. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims it has killed thousands of the invaders but has admitted losing several towns.

Risk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who began taking birth-control pills as teen-agers and used oral contraceptives over several years do not face an increased, long-term risk of breast cancer, according to a study published today. Previous studies have disagreed over whether the use of birth-control pills increases the risk of breast cancer for women through middle age. Some researchers have suggested the conflicting conclusions might be the result of a long-term latent effect from early use. `` But we found no direct human evidence for such a latent effect,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON>, one of four authors reporting on the study of more than 9,000 women in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Early and prolonged use of birth-control pills was defined as using oral contraceptives for at least six years before the age of 25, according to <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> and his colleagues, who were from the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. Researchers collected case histories and interviewed 4,714 women through age 54 who developed breast cancer, then matched them with a control group of 4,540, breaking the subjects into comparable sub-groups depending on how long they had used oral contraceptives. `` This was a very, very large study ... and these data are immensely reassuring,'' said <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> who was at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> when the study was conducted and now is with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The study also gave reassurances about different dosages in birth-control pills, <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning'' show. `` The work you're seeing in this paper reflects the experience of birth control pill use during the 1960s up through the mid'70s, when doses tended to be higher than they are now,'' he said. `` The fact that we find no increased risk from that type of pill use, has implications that the lower dose should not be even that much concern.'' Despite the results of the study, <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> said researchers believe additional large studies should be conducted in the 1990s, `` when the women we interviewed will be in their mid-60s.'' `` More than 50 million women around the world are on the pill and the cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer is about one in 10. When you consider those two things together, you can understand why we'd want someone to take another look,'' <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Striking unions representing people who perform in commercials have agreed to meet with a federal mediator in two weeks, while fallout from the scriptwriters' walkout builds in the television industry. Television production companies said they have laid off more than 1,000 people because of the writers' strike, costing workers more than $ 4 million in salaries and benefits. Union actors who appear in radio or television commercials walked off the sets March 21 in a dispute over payments from ads run on cable television. But Thursday, negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> agreed to meet with advertisers and a federal mediator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on April 6. Performers' unions and representatives for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION> said no preconditions were attached to the planned talks. The Writers Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> went on strike March 7 when talks broke down with producers over rerun payments and creative control on the set. No new talks are scheduled, and representatives from both sides expect a long strike. About 125 writers and producers have had to suspend TV development deals at a cost to them of about $ 1.5 million a week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. Some prime-time TV shows ended production early when scripts ran out, and several projects in the works had to be shelved. Talk shows like <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s `` Tonight Show'' and `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' are broadcasting reruns until the strike is settled. SAG and <ORGANIZATION> AFTRA </ORGANIZATION> represent more than 100,000 actors and announcers working on commercials, while the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> represents more than 9,000 script writers coast to coast.

<HEAD>Terrorist Suspect Released for Insufficient Evidence, Source Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investigating magistrate has released a Lebanese man held in a series of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> bombings because of insufficient evidence, a well-informed source said today. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouhajer </PERSON>, who was arrested last March in a police sweep, was freed Thursday by magistrate <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulouque </PERSON>, according to a source in the magistrate's office. Seven Tunisians also were arrested in the sweep. <PERSON> Mouhajer </PERSON> was released `` because there was not sufficient evidence to keep him in temporary detention'' any longer, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Boulouque </PERSON> has been in charge of investigating a series of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> bombings in 1985 and 1986 that left 13 people dead and 250 injured. French authorities have said <PERSON> Mouhajer </PERSON>, a former philosophy student at the <LOCATION> Sorbonne </LOCATION>, was an ideologist for the Committee for Solidarity with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> Political Prisoners, a group which claimed responsiblity for five of the violent attacks. The source said <PERSON> Mouhajer </PERSON> was held while police investigated his relationship with <PERSON> Fouad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, a Tunisian immigrant described by authorities at the time of his arrest as the leader of a pro-Iranian terrorist network. <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> has been charged in several of the bombings, including a Sept. 17, 1986, attack at the <PERSON> Tati </PERSON> department store that killed six people and injured 51 others. <PERSON> Mouhajer </PERSON> still faces charges of criminal association and illegal possession of arms and has been forbidden to leave the country. Neither charge is related to the terrorist bombings, the source said. A French newspaper today implied that <PERSON> Mouhajer </PERSON>'s release might be connected to Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s hopes for the upcoming presidential election. Four Frenchmen are missing and believed to be held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> said, `` In this electoral period, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> would not be displeased with the release of some French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Earlier this week, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosciusko-Morizet </PERSON>, national secretary of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s party, the Rally for the Republic, visited <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> where he met with a number of Syrian officials. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main powerbroker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and maintains troops in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. On his return to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kosciusko-Morizet </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency Agence France-Presse that the meetings were not related to the French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In all 22 foreigners are missing and believed to be held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

 A robbery suspect who lived in a cave was lured into custody with promises of cigarettes and a hot meal, police said. The man who allegedly put the suspect in a cave was later arrested as well, and apparently tried to commit suicide, police said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON>, 24, had long, dirty hair and apparently had not shaved for at least a week when he was arrested Wednesday night for investigation of robbery, according to Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> was addicted to tranquilizers and was put in the cave by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON>, 37, of <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerrito </PERSON>, who was arrested Thursday. In what police say may have been a suicide attempt, <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> jammed a key into an electrical outlet at a police station and was knocked unconscious. He was taken to a hospital and booked for investigation of robbery. <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> was held at the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON>, who told officers he had been addicted to tranquilizers since he was was 14, admitted at least 15 robberies in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> counties, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. Police said <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> had lived with <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> until last week, when <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> took him to the cave in the hills above the community of Canyon. <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> has a history of emotional problems and `` was afraid to be around people,'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> and a few other friends knew of <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON>'s hiding place, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. They would drive to the area with food and other supplies, and honk to let <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> know they were there. When the two undercover officers following a tip drove to the area Wednesday night and honked, all they could see at first was `` eyes in the bushes,'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Vietnam Veterans Involved In Spraying Suffered No Ill Effects,
Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans involved in the spraying of the herbicide Agent Orange show no unusual health problems to date, according to updated results of a government study. In a statement Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> medical officials called `` reassuring'' the findings that the chemical defoliant has n't caused disease in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, but warned that the results were n't conclusive `` This is the definitive study on Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, and so far it shows that disease is not related to apparent exposure, that there is no increased incidence of major long-term health effects,'' Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, senior investigator in the government's 20-year Agent Orange probe, was quoted as saying in the statement. `` These results are reassuring,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, chief of epidemiology at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The findings reflect the latest tests of 2,309 veterans in the government's investigation into Agent Orange and its impact on soldiers who handled the dioxin-containing herbicide. The study will conclude in 2002. Some <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans are seeking compensation for ailments they say are tied to exposure to the toxic chemical. `` No matter how good this study is, it will never lay to rest the issue for people who argue they were hurt,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gass </PERSON>, head of the Agent Orange registry operation at the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jolla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He said the study is scientifically sound but handicapped by its focus on <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> servicemen involved in handling and dropping the herbicide from aircraft. `` It does n't answer the question about what happened to the man in the field,'' he said. `` The Ranch Handers flew in, flew out. The men in the field were there for days. They did n't take showers.'' Ranch Handers are used because they are assumed by the government to have had the greatest amount of exposure to the chemical. The study, begun in 1982 and conducted for the past four years at <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, examined 1,016 men involved in Operation Ranch Hand and 1,293 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> veterans not involved in the operation. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> physicians assessed each participant for general health, malignancy, and the neurological, psychological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, cardiovascular, hematological, renal, endocrine, immunological, pulmonary and nervous systems. `` These examinations found no evidence of a relationship between Agent Orange exposure and adverse health,'' the statement said. `` A number of minor medical differences were seen but they appear to be unrelated to exposure to dioxin. They will be monitored and re-evaluated during the next scheduled examinations in 1992.'' Last year, a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> study found increased deaths due to lung cancer and certain lymph cancers among <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran Marines, providing what veterans' groups called the first clear scientific data implicating Agent Orange. The <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> statement cautioned that the latest results are not conclusive because the study used estimated levels of herbicide exposure based roughly on amount of contact, not by actual bloodstream dioxin levels. Scientists have recently discovered a way to detect dioxin levels in blood even years after exposure. Analysis of blood samples from 2,010 veterans is expected to be completed within two years. Thursday's findings were released three days after an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> report admitted that an often-cited 1984 government study had been flawed because it did n't make clear that it could n't exonerate the chemical from veterans' health problems.

 An attacker shot and wounded the captain of an Italian jetliner today after the plane landed at <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s airport and tossed two grenades at pursuers before he was captured, authorities said The assailant fired four shots from an automatic pistol at <PERSON> Vittorino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanataniello </PERSON>, who had landed the <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> airliner a few minutes earlier after a flight from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Police said <PERSON> Sanataniello </PERSON> and 12 other crew members were climbing onto an airport bus bound for a city hotel when they were attacked. Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the attacker, identified as <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahadi </PERSON>, was believed to be a member of the <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nidal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist group. They said he apparently had intended to attack a French airline crew. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> flight was due to land at <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> about 40 minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> plane set down. The sources said police had received warnings of a possible attack on <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> targets. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> is the pseudonym of <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Banna </PERSON>, who broke with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. His group has since claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks around the world aimed at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other targets. The attacker was overpowered by two off-duty policemen who chased him as he fled the bus, said Police Commissioner <PERSON> Vasant </PERSON> <PERSON> Saraf </PERSON>. The two grenades he lobbed failed to explode. <PERSON> Sharaf </PERSON> said a second attacker may have escaped in the confusion. The captain was hurt in the thigh and waist, but his life was n't in danger, said an <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> The police sources discounted early reports that <PERSON> Shahadi </PERSON>, 35, was Iranian. They said he claimed to be a Lebanese national but carried no travel documents. He appeared in court today and was being held in a <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> jail. Initial reports described the attack as an attempted hijacking, but police later discounted that theory because the crew had already left the airplane and passed through the airport terminal. Police were investigating whether the attack was linked to the discovery of unexploded grenades in the visitors' lounge of the Saudi Arabian Consulate Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police converged on the airport and <PERSON> Saraf </PERSON> ordered a red alert throughout <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, sealing city exits. Foreign consulates and airline offices in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> were asked to increase security. At the airport, visitors were banned and security strengthened with the deployment of reserve police. <PERSON> Shahadi </PERSON> was being interrogated by police for motives in the attack, the police commissioner said. Police seized a handbag, which contained clothes and two loaded magazines. The airplane had landed at <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> after a flight from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> with stops at <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. It left <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> about two hours after the shooting and was bound for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

 Affidavits released today show that authorities found a skeleton buried in the police chief's yard after being told the man died during a fight with the chief, who is now married to the victim's ex-wife. Authorities on March 14 found the skeleton of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> about 20 feet down after they were told to dig in Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' front yard. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who has since resigned as the part-time chief, has not been charged in connection with the death. His lawyer has said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> had nothing to do with it. An autopsy showed that Bean, 25, died 10 years ago of severe blows to the head and chest. Affidavits unsealed in District Court today paint a picture of wife swapping, brutality and alcohol abuse by Bean and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who was a logger at the time. The statements allege that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told his father 10 years ago that he had accidentally killed a man in a fight and that father and son buried the body. The affidavits allege that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, now 36, and Bean, who were considered close friends, had been drinking together in <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> and got into a fight, and that Bean fell and hit his head and died. The affidavits, used to obtain a search warrant to excavate the yard, contained statements by <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON>. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> is Chambers' sister, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> is her daughter, and <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON> is married to Chambers' sister <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> said her father, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>, 61, told her about the incident twice, but made her promise not to say anything until after his death. The elder Chambers died March 9 of natural causes. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> went to police the next day. <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON>'s affidavit confirmed <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s story. State Police Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was quoted as saying that he learned from the family that Bean's wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, telephoned <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>'s mother in September 1978 to say he had disappeared <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>'s mother that she had learned from Chambers that Bean had borrowed money, and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> had given him a ride to the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> state line and dropped him off. Mrs. <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> won a divorce in June 1979, and she and Chambers were married in September 1979. <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON>'s affidavit said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> initiated a conversation about Bean shortly after the man was last seen. <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told him that `` he hit him so hard, no one would ever see him again. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> to hit the road and <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> did.'' <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> also told him that he, Bean, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> and Chambers' then-wife, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>, were swapping partners for sex. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s statement was similar. She said the relationship between the two couples `` was weird. ... I know <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> always beat <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>, that was why she ran off. -LRB- She -RRB- could n't take it any longer.'' In addition to his Marlow job, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> has taken a leave of absence as part-time chief in nearby <LOCATION> Gilsum </LOCATION> and has been suspended as a trainee with the <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION> police department.

 About 40 minutes after <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> walked out of prison, he married the woman who fought for five years to get him off death row. `` I search for words to describe what I'm feeling. So far the proper words to describe it have n't surfaced,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Thursday after he and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenfels </PERSON> exchanged vows on the lawn of the Clay County Courthouse. `` I feel like I'm getting out of prison myself,'' his bride said before they left for their new home in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` I feel wonderful. I'm so happy I ca n't tell you.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 37, was on parole from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison when a <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge sentenced him to 20 years for armed robbery in 1976. On July 7, 1981, while he was serving the time at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, fellow inmate <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was stabbed to death. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and another prisoner were charged with the slaying after a third inmate, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, said he saw them leaving <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' cell shortly before the murder was discovered. The two were convicted and condemned. Ms. <PERSON> Lichtenfels </PERSON> met <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Christmas 1983 when she was with a group visiting condemned prisoners who had no holiday visitors. `` He was the saddest face I'd ever seen when I met him. It was a spiritual love right from the start,'' recalled Ms. <PERSON> Lichtenfels </PERSON>, 54, a divorcee with three grown children. It was at her prompting that defense lawyers pursued and won an appeal on technical grounds in November that overturned the convictions of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Lichtenfels </PERSON> then she hired a private investigator and tracked down Wise. They agreed to meet and she was given a hidden microphone, with which Wise was recorded admitting that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was innocent and asking for $ 2,000 to recant his testimony. Wise was arrested on bribery charges in December and Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> said in February that he would not to prosecute <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> again because <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>'s credibility was damaged. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that while Ms. <PERSON> Lichtenfels </PERSON> was fighting for the appeal, he considered her optimism unrealistic. He tried to talk her out of it, he said. But `` I did n't know what kind of person she was,'' he said. `` She believes in action.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> must complete his parole term in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.

 An opposition leader returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> vowing to rid the nation of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and sources today said the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church would issue its harshest denunciation yet of the military strongman. It was the fifth day of a general strike that has paralyzed the economy. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, arrived Thursday to find <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the midst of the anti-Noriega general strike, which has shut down more than 90 percent of business and industry. The government refused to allow <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> into the country when he tried to return from a business trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Feb. 25, the day President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was in turn ousted by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters. There was no reason given for blocking <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>'s return, and there was no reason given for his being allowed back. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, said without elaborating that `` the government backed down.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials warned <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> to be prepared for a `` longer haul'' before <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is forced from power. `` Nobody's talking about hours, nobody's talking about days,'' said <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, who is on a fact-finding tour with Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the country's de facto leader by virtue of his influence as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said he had been assured that the church soon would release a statement carrying a `` strong message'' against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Sources from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the message would be the church's strongest statement yet against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, led by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, has sharply criticized <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the past but fallen short of calling for his ouster. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Thursday. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> had refused to discuss the talks, saying only that he was not negotiating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure. Today was payday for the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. On Monday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must come up with money for retirees already forced to wait an extra week for their pensions. A banking source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Thursday the government had pleaded with local banks to hand over an estimated $ 70 million in their vaults. But the banks said the money belonged to their depositors and they could not legally give it up. In an attempt to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into exile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frozen Panamanian deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and withheld payments for use of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> canal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s currency. The country has been in an increasingly chaotic state since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug traffickng charges last month. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> arrived on a commercial flight from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and told a cheering crowd that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go. His return had `` but one objective _ to get rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. He was accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, a likely presidential candidate in scheduled May 1989 elections, said he would meet with other opposition leaders to plan a strategy for ousting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The government stepped up its propaganda attacks Thursday against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its military presence along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The state radio station again urged <LOCATION> Panamanians </LOCATION> _ particularly soldiers and youth _ to be on guard against `` any aggression by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Foreign Relations Ministry denounced a background briefing for journalists at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters on Saturday. The Ministry accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military of `` instructing'' reporters that they `` must help remove'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The last of 670 military police and support personnel arrived Thursday at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases to beef up security. Southern Command officials had said earlier the reinforcements were `` simply good planning in view of the current unrest in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told high school students in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Thursday he had no plans to take military action to get rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We're not going to be the big colossus of the North once again, coming in to ... our smaller neighbors' places of living and business and trying to guide and direct them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A temporary cease-fire between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels held today, and the army pulled out of jungle war zones across the country to avoid clashes that would imperil a new peace accord. Radio Liberacion, the Contras' radio station, has reported no combat since Monday, the first day of cease-fire talks between the government and Contras at the border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. An international verification commission was in its second day of an inspection of the northern border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The group was asked by the Sandinista government to prove that its troops were not across the border. The cease-fire talks ended Wednesday with the peace accord between the government and the U.S.-supported Contras. The Sandinista newspaper Barricada today ran a special edition about the pact. A front page editorial said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> warmongers fail to give the final blow.'' The four-page extra said the reaction of Nicaraguans was that `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the Contras should comply.'' The editorial called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open talks with the Nicaraguan government. With the end of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to the Contras, the `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been disarmed, without pretexts to ask for more funds for its warriors.'' Both sides had called the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> talks <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s last chance for peace, and civilians greeted word of the pact with hope. One critic of the leftist Sandinista government called it a miracle. Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to brief Mexican President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, called Thursday night for direct talks with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to ensure the truce holds. The White House has rejected previous Sandinista calls for such talks, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had first to negotiate with the rebels. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Sandinista troops withdrew Thursday from a jungle war zone in central Chontales province, said a state security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The province has been a hot spot in the 6-year-old war that has cost more than 40,000 lives. To celebrate the accord, dozens of women gathered in the main square of the Chontales city of <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION> and `` lit candles to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leaders extended the informal cease-fire to April 1, when a 60-day truce takes effect and they will meet in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to seek a permanent peace. Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regional peace plan signed Aug. 7 by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents _ ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoring democratic freedoms. The opposition says the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised democracy when they overthrew rightist President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979, but instead established a Marxist regime. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and staunch critic of the government, called the pact `` a miracle.'' In <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said it offers `` a new and firm hope that all Central Americans can live in peace.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the regional peace plan. On Monday, Sandinista and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will meet to designate areas inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to which rebels will go during the first two weeks of April. Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying down their weapons, so that may be taken up in next week's meetings. In past negotiations, the rebels insisted on keeping their weapons until provisions of any accord were carried out. The pact provides a gradual amnesty for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 3,300 political prisoners that starts on Sunday. It also also guarantees `` unrestricted freedom of expression,'' a condition demanded by the rebels, and permits all exiles to return home and participate in the political process. Once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones, the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leadership can send up to eight delegates to participate in national reconciliation talks under way as part of the regional peace plan, the agreement says.

 Jurors in the case of a man accused of strangling a young woman during a Central Park tryst began their ninth day of deliberations today after a tumultuous day during which one juror reportedly asked to be dismissed. Jurors were expected today to begin rehearing medical testimony that state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> estimated would take a day and a half to two days to complete. But shortly before noon, the jury had yet to hear a single word of testimony and had not appeared in the courtroom. It was not clear if the panel was deliberating the fate of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as they awaited the readback of testimony. On Thursday, a juror asked <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> to be dismissed because of an argument over the meaning of medical testimony in the case, said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Chambers, 21, is accused of second-degree murder in the death of 18-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> on Aug. 26, 1986. He could be convicted of the lesser crimes of first - or second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, defense attorney <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> and prosecutor <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> met in the judge's robing room. Despite requests from lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON>, the judge refused to divulge what was discussed. <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> referred to `` that matter discussed in your honor's robing room'' without providing details. One of the 12 jurors _ who have heard eight weeks of testimony _ could be replaced by an alternate at this point only with the consent of both sides, and a mistrial could result if a juror wanted to leave. Jurors were expected back in the courtroom today to begin rehearing medical testimony that <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> estimated would take 1 -LCB- to two days to complete. The prosecution contends Chambers strangled Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> in a rage. The defense has argued he killed her accidentally when he yanked her backward to stop her from hurting him during rough sex in Central Park. At jurors' request, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday instructed them on several points of law, including burden of proof, circumstantial evidence, reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence. The jury's request for a rereading of most of the medical testimony by key defense and prosecution witnesses means lawyers must go through about 1,500 pages of transcripts. The jury asked to hear testimony that bears only on the facts on Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s injuries, not experts' theories on how they occurred.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he welcomes the cease-fire in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but `` there is reason to have caution'' as to whether the couantry's leftist government will observe it. `` Of course we look forward to this and hope it continues, but I think we should keep in mind that, just as in some other meetings that have gone on in which I have been involved, I think that we should keep in mind that both parties must be dedicated to the things that are said and agreed to in those meetings,'' the president said. When a reporter said that it sounded as though he were suspicious that this would not be the case with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I think there is reason to have caution; they have a past record that indicates that we should be.'' The president did not say who he was talking about, but he supports the Contra rebels and has often said that he considers the Sandinista government unreliable. The exchange with reporters took place as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was preparing to meet with visiting president <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaguer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Earlier, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> raised the possibility that the administration will seek legislative authority for a quick vote on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels if the cease-fire there breaks down. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday night that the prospect of additional military assistance to the rebels would be added insurance that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government will abide by promises it makes under its cease-fire agreement with the Contra rebels. But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, D-Tex., indicated that he would oppose any effort by the administration to have an `` expedited procedures'' provision for military aid included in a Contra humanitarian assistance package the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will take up next week `` I want to emphasize positive things, and not anticipate failure,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who was interviewed with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on PBS' MacNeil @ <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> `` NewsHour. The reaction of both the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was generally positive to the agreement reached by the Sandinistas and the Contras, which calls for a 60-day cease fire during which talks on a final settlement will take place. There is agreement among the administration and the lawmakers that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should provide humanitarian aid to the Contras _ permitted under the agreement _ but the comments of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> indicate the military aid issue is not dead. `` I do think there is great merit ... to have in it -LRB- the humanitarian aid package -RRB- a mechanism for a fast track vote,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said there should be a guaranteed early vote on `` whatever the president might ask for.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said such a provision in the humanitarian aid package is tantamount to having a discussion of terms for divorce during a wedding ceremony. `` I think it's inappropriate at this time to be anticipating failure,'' he added. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., a longtime Contra aid supporter, said he thought that any differences over an expedited procedure provision could be ironed out The agreement `` reduces the requirement, in our view, for lethal aid,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said, adding that he believes real compromise is now possible with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on that issue. `` Our differences of opinion are not major,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., a critic of administration policy, said he hopes the agreement will encourage the administration to turn its attention away from `` a military approach, and will begin to work in the context of this agreement for a lasting peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government now has a profound responsibility not to do anything except what is in strict conformity with the precise terms of the cease-fire, neither more nor less We must not tinker with what the Nicaraguans themselves have agreed to.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he welcomes the agreement but that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have a `` history of broken promises.'' `` We have to maintain strength to go with negotiating efforts,'' he said. He added that the real issue in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is democracy and not whether the Sandinistas are in or out of power. `` If there is an open system and an election that's truly a democratic election, and the people now in the government get elected, we have no objection to that,'' he said. `` It's the process that's the key.''

The other men who would be president are no better when it comes to humor, he said. `` They're basically a sterling bunch but I do n't hear the humanity of humor in them. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, 58, believes candidates need humor to prove they are human, quick-thinking and slightly self-effacing _ `` not humor as a form of oppression or a weapon but as a means of liberation or perspective.'' He links a demise of lightness with the rise of electronic media, starting with radio. Until the 1930s, storytelling was an art form, and public figures could rise a long way with a knack for spinning good yarns. Now, with television time so precious and expensive, <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said, `` Politicians think they have to get everything in in a minute instead of seeing things in a larger contextual way.'' The candidates do manage an occasional jab, an occasional jibe, he admits. Bushy-browed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently joked that Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had `` eyebrow envy'' _ a line fed to him by an aide. `` You do n't hear them spontaneously making things up as they go along,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` What I've often argued is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs a levity adviser. The story about him is he's so straight he even lines up his socks in his top drawer.'' So who among recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders had a light touch? <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> admired <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. Asked why he appointed his brother attorney general, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once replied `` because he needs the experience.'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> `` would poke fun at himself for talking too long. He would say ` I should shut up now, but I ca n't.''' And which of this year's candidates are featured in the jokes that criss-cross the nation and sometimes connect with pop culture via television comedians? `` I hear jokes about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and nobody else,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` And a continuance of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> jokes and how ridiculous he is. He's fallen in prestige. You can tell through the humor.'' According to <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a `` throwback'' because he tells stories. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> displayed an ability to laugh at himself after he was shot in 1981, quipping that he hoped the doctors were Republicans and quoting <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> about being shot at `` with no apparent effect.'' `` If you ca n't laugh at youself and laugh at a situation it bespeaks an inflexibility,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` I think one of the problems in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is we separate humor out from seriousness. Politicians who are obviously concerned about getting elected are more hypersensitive to this than others. They think if they use humor they ca n't be taken seriously.'' On the contrary, <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> argues, if candidates show a sense of humor the public is more likely to warm to them when talk turns to weightier issues. To counter the Seven Dwarfs talk, the Democrats `` should have gone to the five and dime and bought masks and gone before the cameras,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said, in all seriousness.

 Surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has asked for twice-a-week visitation with Baby M, while the child's father wants to block all visitation, according to court briefs. `` ... Only a suspension of visitation will ensure that <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> is provided with a loving, supportive, nurturing and peaceful environment, free from interference, at the critical stages of her development,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, a lawyer for the girl's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. In legal papers released today by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON>, <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> said he will present testimony at a visitation hearing Monday that will show the child's psychological welfare is at stake. `` Indeed it is contended that the proofs will indicate that the emotional and psychological burden which <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> will have to sustain in establishing a relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> will be significantly more damaging than any benefit which might occur to her as a result of visitation at this time,'' <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> said in the 25-page brief. The visitation hearing was ordered by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in its landmark ruling Feb. 3 that restored Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s parental rights while awarding custody of the baby, now known as <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has been allowed to see <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> once a week, for two hours, under supervision at a youth center here. Court papers released Thursday by Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s attorney called that schedule `` insufficient.'' The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> housewife, who gained notoriety by refusing to turn over the child she agreed to bear under a $ 10,000 contract, says in court papers that she wants her visits with the child to be expanded eventually to half the summer and some holidays. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> also rejected a request by <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> to terminate contact between mother and child for at least six years. She contends that a break in visitation could be harmful to the child. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has fashioned an excellent relationship with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing and productive relationship,'' her attorney argued. Legal briefs from both sides were filed with <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> earlier this week. The judge released them today after he had time to review them. However, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, an attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, released his brief Thursday. `` The warm, satisfying relationship which has come into existence over the past two years would be lost to <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> if visitation were suspended,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s attorneys said. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> requested that the visits be expanded immediately to two days a week, eight hours each time, at her home for the next six months. She also requested the scheduled be expanded to allow her to see <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> overnight every other week, alternate weekends when <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> is 3, and half the summer and one week of Christmas vacation when the child is 5. The court papers say that when <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> is 12 she may `` voice a desire for more or less visitation.'' <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> has said the Sterns want to delay visitations `` as long as possible.''

<TEXT>
 About 142,200 individuals or their families will be eligible for a new military medal honoring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoners of war, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` The medal will be issued at no cost to any person who was taken prisoner of war and held captive after April 5, 1917,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing it was ready to begin issuing the award, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized two years ago. `` To qualify, an individual must have been taken prisoner during an armed conflict; i.e., World War I, World War II, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and must have rendered honorable service during the period of captivity,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The medal can be awarded posthumously to legal next-of-kin, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the criteria established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not allow relatives of servicemen `` who are listed as missing in action, but for whom there is no evidence of captivity as a POW,'' to receive the medal. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 142,200 individuals or their next-of-kin were eligible for the medal, which features an eagle surrounded by barbed wire and bayonet points and includes the inscription, `` For Honorable Service While a Prisoner of War.'' `` The public law establishing the POW medal specifies that it will be displayed immediately following decorations awarded for individual heroism, meritorious achievement or meritorious service, and before any other service medal, campaign medal or service ribbon,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. A toll-free 800 telephone number has been set up for qualified individuals to request an application form for the medal, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The application forms will also be distributed by a number of veterans organizations and public service agencies. Using the form, an applicant will be expected to provide his full name, service number, Social Security number, <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> claim number, date and place of birth, branch of service, unit of assignment when captured and dates of confinement and release. Processing of the applications will take anywhere from 45 days to 90 days because of the need to verify military records, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it would prefer individuals to use the application form, but would accept a personal letter mailed to the proper military records center providing the same information as that sought on the form. `` Applicants may also submit their requests through a third party, such as a veterans organization or public official, who will agree to receive the medal and present it to the requestor,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The phone number for requesting an application form is 800-873-3768. Personal letters requesting award of the medal or more information should be sent to one of these three addresses: _ For former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> prisoners of war: <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Attn: DARP-PAS-EAW, 9700 Page Blvd., <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. 63132-5200. _ For former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> prisoners of war: <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 9700 Page Blvd., <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> 63132-5199. _ For former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> prisoners of war: <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 9700 Page Blvd., <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> 63132-5199.

 Yugoslav workers cheated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of up to $ 60 million in unemployment funds, authorities said Friday. Bavarian police spokesman <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> said 74 Yugoslavs had been arrested in the past two weeks in the case. He said more arrests were possible. Those arrested were suspected of fraudulently obtaining jobless compensation worth $ 303,000. But he said other Yugoslavs apparently bilked the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> government of $ 30 million to $ 60 million. The suspects had formerly worked in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and applied for unemployment compensation after losing their jobs, according to <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON>. They later moved back to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> but made regular trips to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to continue collecting unemployment funds, he said. West German law stipulates only residents of the country are eligible for unemployment payments. About 590,000 Yugoslavs live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most are employed as `` guest workers'' who remain citizens of their home countries.

 A man linked to a leftist opposition group probably died from police torture, but no one can be charged because the authorities' own inquiry was substandard, a judge ruled Friday. <PERSON> Njenga </PERSON> <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON>, 42, was held without charge and incommunicado for three weeks before he died in February 1987 with injuries consistent with beatings, according to testimony at the High Court Inquest. Government Special Branch officers, who are responsible for internal security, arrested <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> at a coffee shop he owns in <LOCATION> Nakuru </LOCATION>, 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, on Feb. 7, 1987.

However, he said the Special Branch's own investigation into <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON>'s death was `` not up to standard'' and conducted `` with some kind of fear.''

 Angry Palestinians on Friday buried six of the eight women guerrillas killed in an Israeli air raid, and they vowed to avenge their death by continuing the fight against the Jewish state. `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> -LRB- God is great -RRB-, we shall avenge your death!'' chanted the mourners, many with their eyes brimming with tears. `` We shall kill all those who killed you! Your blood will not go cheap!'' shrieked the mother of one of the dead women. The coffins, draped in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, were driven to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in ambulances from the southen port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, where the eight were killed Wednesday in an Israeli air strike on bases manned by guerrillas of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. About 3,000 Palestinians, men, women and children, carrying <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> flags marched in the funeral procession from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elias </LOCATION> refugee camp to the cemetery. Children carried wreaths from various Palesitnian and Lebanese leftist factions. A wreath, signed Fatah-RC, led the procession ahead of a contingent of armed Palestinian guerrillas. Many mourners carried placards proclaiming the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' determination to continue the fight to liberate Palestine Women ululated as the procession marched slowly to the accompaniment of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> revolutionary songs blared from loudspeakers. Only six of the women were buried in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Martyrs' Cemetery. The bodies of the other two were buried in refugee camps elsewhere in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Helmeted Syrian soldiers in charge of security in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> fired their Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles in a final salute as the six coffins were lowered into the ground. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> group is led by convicted terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, who broke away from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, tops the wanted lists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Four <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> employees tested positive for tuberculosis after being exposed to infected monkeys, and a state health official blamed improper quarantine procedures. Three of six endangered Tibetan macaques have died of tuberculosis since arriving last March from the <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> Zoo in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, officials said Thursday. The other macaques remain quarantined although they tested negative for the disease. None of the four workers has tuberculosis so far, though one is under medication, The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified source as saying. A veterinarian who inspected the zoo for the state last spring said Thursday he found several deficiencies that could have led to the infection. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayer </PERSON>, a consultant with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said employees did not regularly wear masks or gloves while around the infectious macaques and were not told to wash their hands before leaving the quarantine area. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Janssen </PERSON>, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, said those safety procedures were n't in effect at that time. A memo shows <PERSON> Janssen </PERSON> implemented changes last May to comply with <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION>'s findings Among those infected with tuberculosis was <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, 27, a senior hospital keeper. `` I was upset and I'm still upset because we did n't have any policy about quarantine procedures at the time,'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said. `` I'm working there and I expect my employer to protect me about things I do n't know about and that was n't being done.'' In another incident, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> recently fined the zoo $ 1,060 for two violations stemming from improper animal and keeper contact. Zoo officials say the facility is contesting the citations and declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials said their inspection was prompted by a complaint and not related to the tuberculosis infection or the state inspector's findings. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> cited the zoo for failing to protect its employees from the possibility of contracting infectious diseases from animals, and because keepers failed to use such protective equipment as boots, gloves, aprons, pants, and protective eye wear or face shields. Tuberculosis, a bacterial disease, once was a leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It now is rarely fatal. Those who test positive for the disease do n't necessarily develop active cases, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, TB control officer for the county.

<HEAD>Republican Congressmen Wary of Accord; To One It's `Disguised
Surrender'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservative Republican members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are wary of the cease-fire pact in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ one calls it a `` disguised surrender'' _ and say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to continue pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> until they install a truly democratic system. At the same time, the congressmen _ attending a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> retreat here _ say it was <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pressure and American aid to the Contras that forced the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to deal with the Contras. The result was this week's dramatic turn of events: a 60-day cease-fire agreement signed by representatives of the Nicaraguan government and the guerrilla leaders, and a Sandinista promise to institute democratic reforms. `` The goal has never been just a cease-fire,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., one of six dozen <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers at the retreat The provisions on democratic reforms in the cease-fire pact are `` weak,'' he said, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should try to keep the Contras alive as a fighting force `` as a spur to continued good faith on the part of the Sandinistas.'' Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., said it was `` reasonably implausible'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> would live up to their promises for reforms But if they do, it would have made the years of supporting the Contras a successful policy. `` The values of the West will have won,'' he said. `` Our goal was to have freedom, not to have a war.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said one of the reasons he had doubts about the pact was because the Contras were negotiating from a weakened state, their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid having been cut off by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a month ago. It's too early to tell, he said, `` to what degree this is a true negotiation and to what degree this is a disguised surrender'' by the Contras. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> acknowledged that the Contras were `` in difficult straits'' but said they `` still have some potential.'' Rep. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, R-Wash., who has co-sponsored a plan to renew military aid to the Contras, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had `` failed miserably'' when they crossed over into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> recently in what he said was an attempt to `` deal a knockout blow to the Contras. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were under pressure not only because of the Contras but because of their war-torn economy that has resulted from the insurgency. `` If we had never supported the Contras, they'd have never been a factor,'' he said. But if the Contras fold their tents and it is `` back to the usual Sandinista behavior'' of totalitarian rule, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to `` take some action with external forces ... external, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` It's down to that,'' he said. `` It's definitely a new era.'' In the meantime, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said, he expected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to rapidly approve some new humanitarian support for the Contras with the option of adding military aid if things turn sour. Democratic leaders have been discussing with the White House and with congressional Republicans a $ 48 million, year long package of non-lethal aid. The plan would allow expedited consideration of arms shipments if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested them. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said that he felt the Contras `` were not put in a very good bargaining position by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he hopes that democracy takes root, but added: `` I'm a cynic.'' <PERSON> DeWine </PERSON> said he feared `` this is just the beginning of the end for the Contras.'' He said he would n't be surprised if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> over the next six to nine months tightened up their authoritarian rule and at that point the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is left with `` very little leverage.'' `` It's a containment policy at that point'' with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trying to help neighboring countries such as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> maintain democracy. <PERSON> DeWine </PERSON> said he supported peace but, he added, `` Is it the peace of slavery? Is it the peace of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>? Is it the peace of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>? Is it the peace of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>?'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., said he was more optimistic `` If they really live up to their commitments, then it really is a good deal,'' he said. If not, however, `` then we've got really big problems.''

<HEAD>Administration Mounts Last Effort to Ease Restrictions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today launched its final effort before leaving office to remove four-decade-old prohibitions on industrial homework in five industries. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it will publish proposed regulations next week that would allow employers to contract work from people in their homes in producing gloves and mittens, embroideries, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry. Unlike the administration's two earlier attempts to deregulate industrial homework, officials said this time they will not try to remove the ban on women's apparel. Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> acknowledged that the exclusion of women's apparel, an area in which investigators have found about half of the violations of the current law, was aimed at defusing opposition from the 210,000-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed revisions also do not attempt to overturn state bans on the same type of work at home in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ILGWU </ORGANIZATION>, other unions and employer associations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> led a firestorm of attacks on the administration's last two efforts to repeal the bans in 1981 and 1986 As a result, only the ban on knitted outerwear was lifted in 1984. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said the latest proposal will be open for 30 days of public comment after it is published in the Federal Register next week. Despite expected challenges from unions and anticipated court appeals, he said the administration hopes to have the prohibitions removed before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. `` It seems to me we ought to be able to get a final rule sometime this summer,'' he said. All of the current prohibitions were adopted from 1941 to 1943 under the Fair Labor Standards Act in response to what then was perceived as rampant exploitation of mostly immigrant home workers paid on a piecework basis. `` The recommendations of this administration demonstrate that it has learned nothing from history,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The record shows that industrial homework has brought nothing but unfair competition, long hours and low wages for our poorest and most disadvantaged workers.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, however, said unions have not yet had a chance to study the latest proposal, which includes what he called a new set of `` enforcement teeth'' such as requiring bonds from employers with records of paying less than minimum wages or other labor law violations.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s son testified today that the family auto dealership was in `` very strong'' shape and that an $ 80,000 loan from the governor's protocol fund was intended to provide higher interest for the fund. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, general manager of <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, testified at the governor's impeachment trial that his father called him in mid-July 1987 and `` asked if I could use $ 80,000 in the dealership operations.'' The governor was expected to take the stand later today. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said his father told him `` they were looking to generate additional interest'' for the protocol fund. The prosecution has contended that the dealership was in dire financial straits and needed the loan to meet its payroll. However, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, asked by defense attorney <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> to describe the dealership's general financial condition at the time, said, `` It was very strong.'' About $ 6,000 of the loan was repaid to the protocol fund in early October, and the governor's son said he was asked Oct. 22 by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> then-chief of staff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON> to repay the balance `` since there was a political question.'' The repayment was financed by family members, he said. On Thursday, former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> special assistant <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said he did not consider the protocol fund to be public money and thus the loan was legal. `` I think we have a politically stupid thing that was done, but not an illegal thing,'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said. `` I think it's a very clear demonstration that here was a man, Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who had total confidence that he was going to be able to repay this. `` He did not sense the public perception of what that might appear to look like to other people because he was so convinced of the correctness of his own approach,'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said. `` Now that's the man that I knew as governor. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> is scheduled to go on trial Monday on a charge of theft by extortion for allegedly trying to influence the vote of a state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused of misusing the protocol fund, which was created with inaugural proceeds and intended to pay for gifts for visiting dignitaries. Prosecutors claim the money became public funds when it was turned over to the governor's office and that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to cover up the loan. However, the defense contends the protocol fund was private money and that the loan was a good business deal because it earned a higher interest rate for the fund. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> agreed Thursday in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> that borrowing from the protocol fund `` was a dumb thing to do politically,'' but he insisted it `` was n't illegal.'' He accused <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prosecutors of having `` to make some kind of a devious program out of this in order to have any fabric to say anything about us.'' `` They would be laughed out of any court in the country, really,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. `` The only place they've got any standing is because this is a political issue; it's really kind of a tragedy, but I think our case will take care of that very easily.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has heard testimony on the first impeachment allegation that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official against former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. The third allegation charges him with concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. A conviction would remove <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office, although the trial could continue on whether to bar him from holding any future office. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. He is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in six decades and the first ever in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is scheduled to go on criminal trial April 21 on six felony charges of hiding the $ 350,000 loan and faces a May 17 recall election.

 Choreographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON>, who founded a dance troupe on a shoestring and built the Joffrey Ballet into one of the nation's top companies, died this morning. He was 57. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON>, who had curtailed his duties at the company because of illness, died at 6 a.m. at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Pennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the company. He had suffered from a liver ailment caused by medication he was receiving for asthma and a muscle condition, and had been in intensive care for two weeks, she said. A lifelong asthmatic, <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> suffered severe asthma attacks in August and had been working from his home since then, she said. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> became ill in April 1986 and was diagnosed as having severe myositis, which causes deterioration of the muscles, enlarged liver and asthma. Earlier this month, he announced a three-person advisory group to help <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Arpino </PERSON>, the company's associate director, run the company `` He had a passion and a love for dance. He respected dancers so much. He loved to bring dance to parts of thew world that had never seen it,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chryst </PERSON>, a former member of the Joffrey who dance with the company for 11 years. In 1956, <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> borrowed a station wagon and sent his fledgling dance company _ six dancers, one of whom could double on piano _ out to tour the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He stayed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he held a job to pay for the tour. Today, the <LOCATION> Joffrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> ranks with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and American Ballet Theater as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s big three ballet companies. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> built by far the most far-ranging repertory. Nobody had ever tried to recreate Vaslov <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>'s 1913 `` The Rite of Spring,'' but <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> engaged two dance historians to see whether they could recreate the ballet. The Joffrey version opened last September in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> brought into the company ballets of strong classical base and flowing quality by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>; the 1932 stylized anti-war masterpiece, `` The Green Table,'' by <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jooss </PERSON>; a group of ballets created for <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaghilev </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranko </PERSON>'s full-length `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>,'' dances by American choreographers from <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mille </PERSON> to the avant-garde. His own ballets include `` The Nutcracker'' in 1987 and his striking 1967 `` Astarte,'' where a couple dance in front of a billowing white silk curtain on which a movie of them dancing is projected. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> was the first artistic director to invite experimental modern-dance choreographers to work with a major ballet company. He brought <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> to ballet in 1973. <PERSON> Arpino </PERSON>, one of the original six dancers, is resident choreographer. Money was always a problem for the company, and <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> was innovative in solving it. He decided that two bases were better than one and announced a bi-coastal company, with boards and fund-raising in both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Last summer, he worked on his $ 1.5 million production of `` The Nutcracker'' in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, with one-third of the money coming from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, where it premiered. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anver </PERSON> <PERSON> Bey </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, Dec. 24, 1930. His father was a native of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and his mother was Italian. He had asthma as a child and a doctor suggested that he take dance classes, for the breathing exercises. He started dance classes in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, studied at the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and later with two modern-dance teachers. His short performance career began with a solo concert of his own works in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He danced with <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>'s Ballets de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1949 and from 1950-52 danced sometimes in the concert group of one of his modern-dance teachers, <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. The Robert Joffrey Ballet Concert performed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> YMHA </ORGANIZATION> in 1954 but <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> dated the founding of his company from 1956, when he taught six dancers four pieces he had choreographed and sent them out in a station wagon to 23 cities. Tours were annual through 1964. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> taught at the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peforming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and choreographed for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and other opera companies, including choreographing `` Alcina'' in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in which <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> made her American debut. By the spring of 1962, the company had 38 dancers and 21 ballets. That fall, the government sent the <ORGANIZATION> Joffrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> on a 15-week tour of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. It was co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Rebekah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harkness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The foundation sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> Joffrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> until March 1964 when <PERSON> Rebekah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkness </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> decided to use the money for a new <ORGANIZATION> Harkness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION>, keeping dancers, costumes, sets, scores and choreography from the previous two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> made a grant to get the Joffrey Ballet going again. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> did intense fund-raising and re-established the company, which became the resident dance company at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> did not do much choreography in recent years. He choreographed part of a new production of `` The Nutcracker Suite'' that was performed this year; his last full production, `` Postcards,'' was performed during the 1970s. He left no immediate survivors. Ms. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said a memorial service would be scheduled at a later date. A viewing was planned for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s Funeral Home on Sunday and Monday.

 A young Irish woman, who came here to visit a sweetheart but found him jailed on murder charges, was struck by a car on St. Patrick's Day and lapsed into a coma, say her family and friends. `` The girl is a beautiful looking girl. When I first saw her lying there in the hospital, I thought to myself, ` It's Snow White in a trance,''' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Archbold </PERSON>, a director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Irish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, 22, was listed in critical condition today at <LOCATION> Weiss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where her parents are keeping a vigil at her bedside. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> left their 13 younger children behind in <LOCATION> Coolock </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, and flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to be with her. Neighbors collected money to help pay for their trip. Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>'s father said he was against his daughter's trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` But she wanted to travel the world, you know,'' he said. And she had a special reason for her trip. Last year she met a man named <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, the brother of a girlfriend, who'd returned to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for a visit. She was attracted to him. `` He took her out, and they must have communicated -LRB- when he returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Archbold </PERSON> said. `` She was infatuated with him.'' So Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, an aspiring actress who dreamed of traveling the world, left her home for a three-week vacation and a visit to <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. When she arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, she learned that <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was in jail, charged with murder, <PERSON> Archbold </PERSON> said. He said he did not know the details of the case against <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, but officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Thursday night that a <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was held there on murder charges. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said today in a telephone interview from jail that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> knew he was in custody before she came and wanted to help him. `` It was very hard to accept, the emotional stress of seeing me behind bars,'' he said. A disillusioned Miss <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> called her family, telling them she'd decided to return home and was planning to leave last Friday. `` She said she'd explain it all to us later,'' her father said. But the day before she was to leave, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> was struck by a car as she crossed a street on the North Side. Her leg and hip were broken, but she was conscious as she was taken to a hospital emergency room, where she slipped into a coma apparently induced by a blood clot, doctors said. Her parents spend their days at their daughter's bedside and their nights at a room given to them by priests at the St. Patrick Fathers home. `` All we can do is wait,'' <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> said. `` There is nothing we can do for her. Where there is life, there is hope.''

<HEAD>Sales Of Existing Homes Up 3.8 Percent In February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of existing homes, after declining for three straight months, posted a modest increase of 3.8 percent in February, a real estate trade group reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said that existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.29 million units in February. While this was 11.3 percent below the sales level of a year ago, it was the first advance since a 1.2 percent rise in October. Sales fell 2.9 percent in November, 1.2 percent in December and 4.8 percent in January as the housing market was rocked by volatile mortgage rates and consumer worries sparked by the October stock market collapse. The February increase in sales was credited to better economic news, falling interest rates and renewed consumer confidence. Fixed-rate mortgages, which stood at 10.61 percent at the beginning of the year, have fallen into single-digits, standing at 9.92 percent currently. `` Lower interest rates have brought the consumer back into the market,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the association. `` February's existing home sales numbers indicate good health on the part of the housing sector, which, in the sixth year of expansion, is far from dead.'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted the lower mortgage rates would help boost sales even further in the months ahead. The rise in home sales was accompanied by a slight increase in home prices. The median or mid-point price of a home increased to $ 88,300, up from $ 87,400 in January. The increase in sales was led by a 12.8 percent jump in sales in the South, which rose to an annual rate of 1.23 million units, still 4.7 percent below the level of activity a year ago. This region has been hard hit by depressed conditions in the oil industry. Sales were also up in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, climbing 8.2 percent to an annual rate of 660,000 units. Sales fell 5.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 870,000 units, but analysts blamed this decline on unusually severe weather in the region during February. Sales dipped a small 1.9 percent in the West to an annual rate of 520,000 units.

 President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today, declaring that his island nation is `` as peaceful and tranquil as it can possibly be in today's world.'' <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> was expected to seek increases in aid and sugar quotas during the meeting, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition he not be identified. The official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` looking for ways to be helpful.'' As the two leaders posed for photographers before their meeting, <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> was asked if everything was calm and peaceful in his country, which has seen violent uprisings in the past. `` Yes, everything is calm and peaceful,'' he said. `` As peaceful and tranquil as it can possibly be in today's world.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked if the same could be said of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, replied, `` I would say that the situation is normal.'' <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, elected to his fifth term as president of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation in 1986, arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday and was meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> follows a visit Thursday to a high school in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Appearing with Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised a trend toward `` free-market principles'' in education that provide incentives for teachers who achieve superior performance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sharply reduced aid to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in recent years and has lowered its quotas on imports of sugar, a major Dominican crop. `` Their economic difficulties, and they have economic difficulties, are largely the product of our sugar policy,'' said the senior official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. `` Our imposition of lower and lower sugar quotas every year has diminished their ability to sell sugar to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that has been a really crippling blow to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> economy,'' the official said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has pressed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unsuccessfully for changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar policy. Inflation is running at around 30 percent and unemployment at close to that figure in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the official said. `` We are very appreciative of the efforts of President <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> to keep the economy of his country on an even keel,'' the official said. `` I do n't think there is anybody in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> who is appreciative of our aid cuts or cuts in the sugar quota.'' Although the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> has received substantial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in the past, it is down for nothing in either economic support funds or military assistance in the fiscal 1988 budget. The figure for development assistance is a relatively modest $ 18.7 million. The sugar quota declined about 27 per cent this year and is `` on a downward trend,'' the official said. In 1983 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought 500,000 tons, or $ 188 million worth, of Dominican sugar. This year the total was 125,000 tons, valued at about $ 50 million. `` They will ask for additional aid, either direct financial aid or other forms of assistance,'' the official said. `` We are looking for ways to be helpful,'' he added.

Public protests had been called for Saturday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but radio broadcasts in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> warned citizens of both <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics Friday against illegal demonstrations. The broadcasts announced new regulations requiring permits 10 days in advance of all public gatherings. <PERSON> Hovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON>, an Armenian activist reached by telephone, said the Saturday demonstrations `` wo n't happen.'' <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said they were called off, `` considering the situation.'' He also said activists had learned that Armenian nationalist <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> was arrested Thursday night. He said they did not know the charges, but <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> had provided information about the protests to foreign reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. An Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reaching <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday said the republic `` remains tense and explosive.'' It spoke of `` unpredictable consequences'' if the demonstrations were held. Activists and official sources in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> most Armenians appeared to be wary of illegal protest because of the crackdown. A duty officer at the police ministry described the security precautions by telephone and said <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> was `` fairly calm.'' He would not give his nam. <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said groups of three to five soldiers of the internal security forces were patrolling with police and that helicopters had been circling over the city for three days. Repeated attempts to telephone <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Friday were unsuccessful. On Thursday, the national party's governing Politburo issued an eight-year plan for dealing with complaints about discrimination against ethnic Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, where they are more than 75 percent of the population. Pravda and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the party and government newspapers, gave prominent display Friday to letters from readers urging reason and patience in resolving the territorial dispute between Armenians, most of whom are Christians, and the predominently Shiite Moslem population of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The letters, and official commentaries, had the apparent purpose of portraying the leadership's approach to the sensitive ethnic issue as a wiser course than strikes and demonstrations. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the Politburo's eight-year plan provides for more housing, roads, schools and social services in the disputed region, and more Armenian television programming and literature. Concern that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was losing its traditional Armenian character was among the reasons prompting calls for annexation. Armenian residents of the area began protests in mid-February after the national party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected a request from the the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> government for union with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The region, slightly smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, was part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> until 1923. Official media described the annexation drive as an extremist action, and hundreds of thousands of Armenians demonstrated in the streets of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. The mass unrest abated only after Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for calm and reason. On Feb. 28, extremists in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, went on a rampage to protest the Armenian demands, and officials said at least 32 people were killed. The official reports said 197 were injured and about 400 arrested for murder, rape, robbery or other crimes in the industrial city. Armenian supporters of the annexation proposal, including some prominent officials in the southern republic, formed a committee to press the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> issue and called the protests for Saturday. The committee withdrew the appeal for protests, but nonetheless became a target of authorities. Wednesday's issue of <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, the Armenian party daily that reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday, accused the committee of blackmail, threats and anti-party attacks. It said officials were ordered to `` take measures necessary to avert meetings on March 26'' and party organizations were told to `` neutralize activities of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> ` committees' because at present their actions are politically harmful.'' Vassilian, the activist, also said the committee was ordered `` closed'' Friday. Prominent officials and literary figures appealed on radio and television for patience and an end to protests and strikes, he said. Pravda said it was suspending an Armenian journalist who contributed to a report on the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute but denounced it after publication Monday. The party newspaper said it had handwritten copies of the information submitted by the journalist, identified as <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arakelyan </PERSON>, and his report conformed with the published article. It did not give details of his original material.

 The head of the nation's largest teachers' union today proposed that every state designate a school district as a `` living laboratory'' for experiments aimed at producing better educated students <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said she will ask her state affiliates to work with governors, state legislators and state school officials to bring about such experiments on a broad scale. She told a news conference that teachers, parents and others in the experimental districts would have the union's blessings to `` turn their school systems upside down or inside out'' in pursuit of improvements. In response, Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in a statement: `` It's rather ironic to hear a call for reform from the organization that has done the most to resist meaningful education reforms in recent years. But if they are serious, it will be a welcome and refreshing change to have <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> begin supporting real education reform.'' Each state should have at least one district operating `` as an experimental, living laboratory for education reform,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said. `` In these 50 school districts, school employees, working through their local association, would join with school boards, parents, civic leaders and business to develop whatever innovative or creative program they deem appropriate to improve education,'' she said. `` Those 50 local communities would be free to turn their school systems upside down or inside out,'' she said. `` They would be free to open their school doors to 4-year-olds, or end the arbitrary division of class periods into 50-minute chunks, or experiment with alternatives to student tracking,'' she said. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said the idea must still be approved by delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in July. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> told the news conference that if a laboratory school district decided to adopt a merit pay plan, the national union would not object. She also said the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> was prepared to provide some financial support for the experiments and said that bold action is needed to revive what she called lagging efforts to improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools. `` Five years after ` A Nation At Risk,' lack of funding is strangling education reform in state after state,'' she said, referring to the landmark report on the state of education. She said Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` wants <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to believe that excellence costs nothing, that just talking about reform _ and blaming people _ will substitute for money. It wo n't.'' State and local governments have poured more money into public schools, she said, `` but they ca n't do the job without help from the federal government.'' The federal share of the public school budget has slipped from 9.2 percent in fiscal 1980 to 6.2 percent in fiscal 1988, she said, and education's share of the overall federal budget has dropped from 2.5 percent in fiscal 1979 to 1.8 percent in fiscal 1987.

 Japanese monopolies on trade in tobacco and beef must be eliminated because they are barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, a former <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday during his confirmation hearing for the post of top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator on farm trade. `` The monopolies must go,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of agriculture, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are barriers to trade just as sure as import quotas are. ... They are a kind of marriage between industry and government.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is insisting on elimination of Japanese quotas on beef imports. `` I think we'll be successful,'' he added. <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON> agreed with Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., who urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators to push international sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products `` This is not the place to make moral judgments,'' <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON> said after the hearing. The official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign against smoking was not discussed at the session itself. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said moral judgments about practises in other countries are `` not up to us.'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> estimated that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s cigarette market rose from 2 percent to 11 percent in two months after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure succeeded in easing restrictions on Japanese imports. He urged <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON> to be aggressive in getting restrictions eased in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> too. He said that despite the popularity of Turkish tobacco, many Turkish workers acquired a taste for American tobacco as `` guest workers'' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and created a demand for it when they returned home. Smoking in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is on the increase and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should take advantage of the opportunity, he said. <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON> declined to say what priority he would give to pressing cigarette sales. `` Everything is first,'' he said. He explained that at the big international trade discussions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, known as the `` <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round,'' an effort is being made to keep the negotiations away from particular products. On farm products, the emphasis has been on reducing government subsidies. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has proposed that all government farm subsidies be phased out by the year 2000. Other governments have called the goal unrealistic. The committee is expected to approve <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON>'s nomination next week.

<HEAD>Taxi Drivers Get Jail Sentence in Protest of Smog Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge sentenced 20 taxi drivers to jail Friday after they defied the city's new anti-smog ban. The new rules, which allows taxis and private cars in a 5-square-mile area of downtown only on alternate weekdays and on weekends, are aimed at dispelling the acrid cloud that hovers over the city in still weather. The cabbies say they are not at fault and the ban hurts their business. The 20 taxi drivers were sentenced to five weeks in jail. Another 35 cabbies were fined $ 150 each, said a judiciary spokesman requesting anonymity. The 55 cabbies drove into the banned area on Monday and Tuesday during protests organized by their union, which seeks daily access for all the city's 15,000 taxis. The spokesman said all 20 cabbies were freed after appealing the sentences.

 Three boys removed from a religious commune by court order and returned to their fathers, at least temporarily, had been physically and emotionally abused by cult leaders, the fathers say. Deputies surprised devotees of the <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Susan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> communes in <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION> on Thursday, reuniting the children with their fathers before a custody hearing in <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was a lot of confusion and cries of anguish from the adults,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakebush </PERSON> said. `` There were people everywhere, people running around the grounds shouting.'' The boys' mothers were n't at the <ORGANIZATION> Alamo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> commune when the raid took place. <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON> gained notoriety when he vowed that his wife <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, who died of cancer in 1982, would be resurrected. He kept her embalmed body on display for six months while followers prayed. The custody dispute involves brothers <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, who were banished from the commune after 15 years as members following a disagreement over control of a trucking firm they operated in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. `` My wife is absolutely and completely brainwashed by <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON> to the extent that she has now consented to live with another man as husband and wife,'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 34, said in a sworn statement. `` I am given to understand that I was now an outsider and would be prevented from seeing my wife and children.'' The men filed court statements contending the children were abused, physically and emotionally, by their mothers and cult leaders, and that they feared their sons would soon be taken to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> if they did n't act to regain custody. Both have begun divorce proceedings. They also said they were wrongly separated from their families after a business dispute with church leaders, contentions the commune's founder denied. `` They abandoned their wives and children, embezzled money from the church and lied in court about it,'' <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The foundation has sued the brothers for allegedly emptying the trucking company's bank accounts when they left the commune. <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON> said commune members agree to sign over all property to the church, something the brothers balked at doing with their trucking company. Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> granted the Millers temporary custody of the boys, ages 11, 9 and 4, until an informal mediation session April 6 and a court hearing five days later to hear arguments about permanent custody. Attorneys for the two mothers, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, and the church said the women were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> selling clothes made at the commmune northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> brothers said they fled the commune in fear of their lives in September after an altercation with <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and church officers. `` I never threatened anybody,'' said <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON> and his wife started preaching on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in 1966.

<HEAD>Health Advisory Issued On Egg Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health authorities have warned that eggs from two farms near the site of a chemical fire last year contain toxic dioxin at levels 100 times greater than in normal eggs. Officials of the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they advised about about 45 familes living near the Koppers Wood Treatment Plant not to eat eggs or chicken from the two family farms. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> was the site last April of a fire and explosion that left residues of a toxic wood preservative used at the plant. Dioxins are a class of toxic chemicals found in a variety of chemical compounds, including some preservatives. Minute levels are also generally found in all animal products. While there is no proof that dioxin has ever killed anyone, a 1980 report by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said immediate effects of exposure to dioxin can include burning in the eyes, nose, and throat; headaches; itching, swelling and redness of the face; dizziness; nausea and vomiting. There is also increasing evidence of an association between occupational exposure to dioxins and a rare form of tumor called soft tissue sarcoma, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The eggs and chickens may have been contaminated as a result of the Koppers accident, but an investigation is continuing to pin down the source, said state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON>. `` If we knew the cause of the contamination, we would say so,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Borzelleri </PERSON> of the department's toxics division. Samples taken from the two affected farms last May showed dioxin levels of 10 parts per trillion, compared with levels of 0.1 parts per trillion found in eggs a few miles away. Samples taken this month show dioxin levels ranging from 15 to 30 parts per trillion. Eating one contaminated egg a day over a 70-year lifetime would increase a person's chances of developing cancer from 250-in-1 ,000 to 253-in-1 ,000, the department's scientists <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightle </PERSON>, who owns one of the farms, said he was angry that the state testing took so long. `` One of my daughters loves to eat eggs. ... I'm worried for my kids,'' <PERSON> Lightle </PERSON> said. `` The state told us after the fire it was OK to eat our eggs and stuff out of the garden. They should have issued an advisory from the very start. I would rather have buried the eggs or thrown them out.''

 Acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> declared Friday that economic reform was irreversible but cautioned against hasty change as he opened the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The 59-year-old technocrat is expected to be confirmed as premier during the legislature's 20-day session. In the 2 -LCB- - hour speech, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> resoundingly endorsed the nation's reform But he stayed true to form by sounding repeated notes of caution against expecting rapid prosperity or making changes faster than people can accept them. `` We must not rush headlong into mass action, issue arbitrary orders and spoil things by excessive enthusiasm,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> warned. `` We can not succeed if we are too impatient for quick results.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which sits for five years, is expected to approve key measures giving legal underpinning to the market-style economic reforms that have doubled Chinese incomes over the past decade. The congress itself is intended to be a showpiece of the reforms. Its 2,970 delegates were elected by provincial legislatures and the military using multiple candidate balloting for the first time. Several working meetings are being opened for the first time to foreign reporters, in addition to the ceremonial opening and closing sessions. Before the start of Friday's session, reporters were allowed to mix freely with delegates as they drank tea at small tables in the cavernous entry room of the Great Hall of the People and watched `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'' cartoons on a small TV at one end. In his speech, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> applauded the achievements of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic decentralization and said the state's role in the economy gradually will be reduced from that of planner to indirect market regulator. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> generally is regarded as more cautious than his predecessor, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who has become the leading architect of all-out economic and political decentralization. However, he echoed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s words by declaring that increased productivity must be `` the criterion for judging all our work.'' At a major party congress in October at which he was named party general secretary, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said development must take precedence over ideology if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is to end its chronic poverty. `` We should continue to put reform at the center of all our undertakings,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said in agreement. `` It has become an irreversible trend for the masses and cadres alike to take an active part in the reform.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who sat behind <PERSON> Li </PERSON> on the stage, appeared restless during the long speech. On his left, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 83, the initiator of the reforms, followed the text closely while chain-smoking. He said price increases were <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s No. 1 economic and social problem, but for the first time in public endorsed continuing the gradual decontrol of prices long distorted by stae subsidies. However, he said workers will be given direct subsidies for some staple foods, on which price ceilings will be imposed. Inflation was 7.3 percent nationwide last year but hit 19 percent in some cities during the summer. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said that in the next five years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must increase grain production, encourage scientific development, revitalize the bureaucracy and reduce controls on enterprises. One of the few specific goals he set was to raise grain production by about 8 million tons, or 2 percent, per year. Grain production hit a record of 407 million tons in 1984 but since has declined, causing shortages of livestock feed and pork rationing. Delegates interrupted <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s speech with applause 17 times, generally at natural pauses in the text. When he finished, applause was brief and perfunctory and the huge hall emptied within five minutes as top officials rushed to their chauffeur-driven Mercedes Benzes and ordinary delegates to their buses. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, grinning widely, was congratulated by his colleagues in the party and government leadership as he walked back to his seat and gulped tea. The congress will hold four more plenary sessions to hear reports from top officials before gathering April 13 to vote on proposed legislation and elect top officials. The congress also is expected to name Gen. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> as successor to outgoing President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>. Although the congress long has served as a rubber-stamp body for Communist Party decisions, in the past few years it has taken a more active role in debating and even amending party proposals.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded today that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was almost certain to win the Republican presidential nomination, saying, `` I can read the numbers.'' On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> denied reports that his candidacy was near an end and declared `` we're going to turn this race back around'' in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader, indicated he was in the process of re-evaluating his presidential campaign and would likely `` have something to say about that'' before the April 5 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. `` I've been saying now for some time as a candidate all the things I thought we should focus on and nobody really seems to care,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told his audience. `` I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side.'' `` But I still have some things to say,'' he added. `` Lo and behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find more people willing to listen.'' Still, he said, `` I can read the numbers and I probably know what's happening.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won a huge lead in delegates in the past month. All five Democratic presidential candidates were in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> today, scouring the state for votes on the eve of Saturday's caucuses with 138 delegates up for grabs <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> clearly had the most at stake in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a state his own aides described as a do-or-die situation for his once vital presidential campaign. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman mimicked rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim of an economic miracle in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, saying he looked forward to a `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> miracle'' to revive his candidacy. `` I think we're going to turn this race back around here in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning'' program. `` We're going to get back in the middle of this thing.'' His aides said Thursday that without a win this weekend, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman would end his presidential bid and run for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. The filing deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat is Tuesday. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a Democratic rival, said today at a Lansing airport news conference, `` My hope is that <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> can stay in the race.'' As for the possibility that he himself would win no delegates in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, `` I recognize that's a possibility but it's not fatal to my campaign. Fellow Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s county jail today, telling inmates they must take control of their lives and shun the `` short-term thrill, long-term chill'' of drugs. He urged the inmates at the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail to ask for absentee ballots and vote in Saturday's caucuses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned Thursday in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where he was expected to cruise to an easy win in Tuesday's primary. He grew up in the state, and his father was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been under fire in recent days for supporting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a sweeping civil rights bill. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overrode the veto this week. The vice president said he favored the basic premise of the bill, but did n't want to go against the president on the matter. Besides, he said, the legislation was flawed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has scoffed at that, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lacks leadership. `` Perhaps Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was talking when he should have been listening,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted Thursday. `` If he's the nominee, we'll have a chance to discuss civil rights records and I'll lay my record on the ground with anybody. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Democratic rivals were too timid about criticizing him. `` It's not that I'm afraid to do what some Democrats are afraid to do _ go after him,'' he said. At a news conference, the vice president also expressed admiration for former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to criminal charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair. `` I think anybody who sheds his blood for his country and wins a Purple Heart _ three of them _ and a <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> deserves whatever accolades one gets for that kind of stellar heroic performance,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not expect the arms-for-hostages affair to hurt his campaign. `` The Democrats will be trying to raise it and make an issue out of it,'' he said, but added: `` I do n't think anyone has ever implicated me or suggested any wrongdoing.'' For the second time this week, a poll suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have a tough fight on his hands if he were running against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated 46 percent of all registered voters polled favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 45 percent backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. A survey by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also put the two neck and neck, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> polling the best against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among the Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a round of appearances today in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. On Thursday, he was replenishing an already impressive campaign treasury with fundraisers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor fielded questions in English and Spanish. Asked whether he would consider a Hispanic running mate, he answered `` Vamos a ver'' _ we'll see. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who was crushed in the big round of Super Tuesday contests earlier this month, said no matter what the press or anyone else says, his candidacy is n't dead. `` I do n't think they are aware of the Resurrection,'' the former television evangelist told supporters in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. At recent appearances, however, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has acknowledged he has little chance to win the nomination and is concentrating on his role at the convention and his impact on the party

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday the record of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led government indicates `` there is reason to have caution'' that it may not live up to the cease-fire agreement reached with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. It was the first time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had commented in any detail on the 60-day nationwide cease-fire, effective April 1, that was announced Wednesday after negotiations in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Of course we look forward to this and hope it continues, but ... just as in some other meetings that have gone on in which I have been involved, I think that we should keep in mind that both parties must be dedicated to the things that are said and agreed to in those meetings,'' the president said. When a reporter said that it sounded as though he were suspicious that this would not be the case with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I think there is reason to have caution _ they have a past record that indicates that we should be.'' The exchange with reporters took place as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was preparing to meet with visiting president <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. During his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing earlier, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters `` we are having discussions with the resistance leadership'' about the new cease-fire plan. `` We're very hopeful that it works,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We want to do whatever we can to see that it works.'' But at the same time, the spokesman said the administration is `` very hopeful'' that a package of humanitarian assistance to the Contras can be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Easter recess He said that while the administration remained somewhat skeptical of the Sandinista intentions, a mutually agreed cease-fire between the Marxist regime and the Contra rebels `` was the No. 1 item on the agenda'' in the joint peace plan that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered last August in coordination with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said Friday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no intention of entering into direct discussions with the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> _ as suggested by Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` We have never envisioned bilateral talks. ... We have said that once a cease-fire was reached ... we would be willing to talk on a multilateral, regional basis'' involving the leaders of Central American democracies. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to speculate on what motivated the resistance fighters to enter into a cease-fire agreement, although he did say `` it's certainly understandable that they would find the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> less than supportive,'' given the defeat of new aid packages on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The spokesman reiterated administration statements urging the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to lower the level of military assistance it has been sending to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We have talked to the Soviets. We have made our views, publicly as well as privately,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he also said `` we believe it's very important to have an -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- aid package -LRB- for the Contras -RRB- ... as a means of keeping pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>'' to institute Democratic reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conservatives were voicing some muted criticism of the agreement, but appeared willing to put the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the test and wait to see whether pledges of amnesty and political pluralism are fulfilled. `` They've gained something,'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said of the rebels, but added: `` It's an agreement that's shaded on the bad side ... What they're after is a pluralistic government with human rights, and they have none of that.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said `` a sense of euphoria is not in order. The Sandinistas promised all of this -LRB- the pledges in the agreement -RRB- at the time they took power. I do n't believe I've ever heard of a leopard changing his spots.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said the agreement removes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at least for the moment, from any influential role in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We are in a position of wait and see,'' he said. `` The only improvement is that the heat will really now be on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to put up or shut up.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said `` I do n't have any real problems with this agreement if it's kept,'' but he was skeptical about whether that could occcur. `` It's incumbent on us now to find out what other pressure we can keep on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. We ca n't afford not to be players. The end product of what they've agreed to still leaves a Soviet puppet state in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' receiving large amounts of weaponry. `` That worries me in terms of our relationships with the nations that surround <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. I view <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as being more worrisome for our future than <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.''

 Police and firefighters today agreed to end their day-and-a-half bout of `` blue flu'' and return to work after city officials promised to set up a committee to discuss their salary complaints, a police representative said. `` Apparently, the mayor is appointing a committee this afternoon comprised of members of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Cpl. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, adding that the committee would meet with police officers Monday. He said police and firefighters would return to work this afternoon as part of an agreement that included creation of the committee. Mayor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> this morning ordered police and firefighters to end their sick-out, saying there's a strong possibility those who refused to return to work would be fired. On Thursday, officers ignored similar back-to-work orders from a circuit judge and the City Council, forcing city officials to call in state police, shut down two fire stations and declare a civil emergency. This morning, 119 of 144 police officers remained off the job for the second consecutive day to protest a 2 percent pay raise, but 30 of 44 firefighters reported for work, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, a City Hall aide. `` They seem to be recognizing the concern that firefighters who had been on duty since 8 a.m. Wednesday were exhausted,'' he said, adding there was no indication the firefighters were ending their sick-out. Most of the firefighters held over when the job action began were sent home this morning to rest. At a press conference today, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said that Thursday was `` a grace period, allowing cooler heads to review this situation.'' `` I believe the last 24 hours have given police and firefighters enough time to obey the court order and return to work, and in keeping with uniformed services policy I am ordering all police personnel to report for duty by 2 p.m. this afternoon, and all fire personnel to report for duty by 6 p.m.'' When asked what would happen if the officers remained defiant, he said there was a `` strong possibility'' that those who ignored his order would be fired. The job action in this state capital of 63,000 people, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s largest city, began after city officials announced a 2 percent pay raise for city employees effective July 1. Police and firefighters say the raise is inadequate. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said today he will not meet with police and firefighters until they return to work, and that there is no money for larger raises. `` Let them come forward and show me where the money is,'' he said. Firefighters and police who return to work today face no punishment, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said, but must have a doctor's excuse. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, appearing on television Thursday night, read a statement announcing that two fire stations in outlying areas of the city were being closed temporarily because of manpower shortages. `` At this time I am again asking the police and the firefighters to return to duty at the earliest time or on their next shift,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said on WSAZ-TV. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> _ after declaring a state of emergency _ warned absent workers that `` if you do n't come back to work, you are in contempt of court.'' Less than an hour before an emergency city council meeting Thursday, <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> issued a temporary injunction ordering police and firefighters to return to duty. The order was ignored, with 42 of 44 firefighters not reporting and about a dozen policemen out on a shift that normally has 16 or 17 officers, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. At most, three patrol cars cruised the city Thursday, police chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnett </PERSON> said. `` We're at skeleton now,'' <PERSON> Garnett </PERSON> said, but the public was `` helping out quite a bit'' by not making unnecessary calls to dispatchers. In addition, two state police cruisers patrolled <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> because of the sick-out, state police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Two fire trucks were taken out of service Thursday evening because of a manpower shortage and officials said an additional fire station could be shut down today if the protest continued. The city council Thursday unanimously suspended the city's sick-leave policy, meaning those who called in sick would have to have a doctor's excuse to get paid for any additional absences The sick-out had the `` potential effect of rendering the city unable to maintain public order,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> told the 26 council members. About 20 police officers' wives picketed City Hall on Thursday. Passing motorists honked their horns in support, and some _ aware that patrols were down _ took the opportunity to run red lights. Many of the wives denied their husbands were striking. `` Mine is sick. I do n't know about everybody else,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` There's no strike.'' The 2 percent raise averages $ 438 per employee annually, mayoral aide <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. He said the uniformed services got a 3 percent raise in the last fiscal year and raises totaling 8 percent over the past five years, he said. The city budget, approved Monday night, includes appropriations for 165 policemen, 147 firefighters and 10 paramedics. Police salaries range from $ 18,589 for a patrol officer at three years to $ 27,673 for a captain with 20 years' experience. Firefighters pay ranges from $ 18,409 for a first-year firefighter to $ 27,673 for an assistant fire chief with 20 years' experience.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today arranged to meet with two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and discouraged Americans from traveling to the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The travel advisory cited `` continuing disturbances'' in the areas. In nearly three months of Palestinian protests, 111 Palestinian Arabs and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed. `` We are not issuing am advisory for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself,'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy spokeswoman, said. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is safe for American travel.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will hold the meeting with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, on Saturday `` to discuss our approach to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process,'' the announcement said. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> stressed that Said and Abu-Lughud are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. She said the 13-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> remained intact. `` There is no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on negotiating with or recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` That policy remains as it has been since 1975.'' The council is the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The brief announcement identified Said and Abu-Lughud only as `` prominent Americans with an intimate knowledge of contemporary Middle Eastern politics.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in persuading <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish territory to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, promised in 1975 it would not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is committed to dismantling the Jewish state. The pledge subsequently was incorporated into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had given Said and <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON> permission to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` I have nothing on that.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> initiated the meeting. `` He will discuss the Palestinian point of view,'' she said. `` They have an intimate knowledge of Middle Eastern politics.'' The travel advisory cautioned Americans to avoid going to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> `` until further notice.'' It said Americans living there `` should exercise particular caution.'' The situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which was held by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> until 1967 and is now part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capital, was described as `` unpredictable.'' The advisory said Americans should check with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in the city before entering the area. `` Under all circumstances, Americans should avoid demonstrations and other situations that have the potential to lead to violence,'' the advisory said. `` American travelers should carry their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports at all times.'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador, telephoned <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, on Thursday to protest the meeting as a violation of the pledge. Said and <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON> could not be reached immediately to be asked what they intended to take up with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and whether they had sought <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> approval for the meeting. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met here with two Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Their visit was arranged with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cooperation <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had excluded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from his proposal to open <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations on May 1. His plan calls for Palestinians approved by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to participate in a joint delegation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. During a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> shuttle last month, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> tried to arrange a meeting in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with 15 Palestinian Arabs. Apparently under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders, none of them showed up. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> went to a hotel in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, stood in the floodlit courtyard and read a statement suggesting the Palestinians were fearful of working with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Opportunity knocks loudly on your door,'' he said then. `` Now is the time to get to work. We have a workable plan, and we are ready to commit our efforts to it. The time is right, together, to make decisions of historic proportions.'' Some 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The lands were held by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> until they were lost to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day war.

<HEAD>Anti-Gadhafi Group Claims Libyan Forces Chief in Chad Defects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chief of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s forces in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> has joined a group opposed to Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, the opposition group said Friday. The National Front for the Salavation of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> reported the defection of Col. <PERSON> Khalifah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> el-Kassem Haftar, a participant in <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s 1969 revolution against the Libyan monarchy, in a statement distributed to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> news agency offices. Considered the strongest Libyan exile opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters are in the Egyptian capital. Telephone calls to <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Magariaf </PERSON>, the Front's secretary general and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s former <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, went unanswered The Front statement quoted <PERSON> Haftar </PERSON> as saying that hundreds of Libyan officers in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> agree on `` the necessity to struggle together with their brothers in the <ORGANIZATION> NFSL </ORGANIZATION> ... to save the country from <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s terrorist and dictatorial rule.'' The statement did not indicate where <PERSON> Haftar </PERSON> is or say when he was supposed to have defected. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> spokesman known by the nom de guerre <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Nour </PERSON> said the man was a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> before his defection. Libyan claims to a large zone of northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> along their border have been the object of a long-running war between the two north African nations. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> backs rebel forces against the current central government in <LOCATION> N'Djamena </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> statements were true, <PERSON> Haftar </PERSON>'s defection apparently would be the first of such a high-ranking officer among Libyan forces in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. Colonel, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s rank, is the highest attainable in the Libyan armed forces.

 Brake failure caused two passenger trains to collide head-on outside <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, killing 28 people and injuring 99, officials said Friday. Among the dead were 27 members of a Japanese high school tour group. The two trains crashed head-on Thursday in a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> suburb, crushing and derailing several front cars. About 400 rescue workers were dispatched to the scene. The crash injured 99 people, 17 of them seriously, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted officials as saying at a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> news conference. Most of the survivors from the 193-member Japanese tour group boarded a chartered plane in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Friday night to return home. Dozens of relatives of the Japanese dead and injured, meanwhile, arrived in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixiang </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the No. 311 train from <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> tried to halt at a station as scheduled. But its brakes failed and it continued 460 feet into the path of train No. 208 arriving from <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>. The driver of No. 208 applied his emergency brakes but was unable to prevent the collision, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> as saying.

 A jury awarded two nurseries $ 1.5 million to cover losses to their citrus stock during the 1984 canker scare in a case that could set precedent. A circuit jury returned its verdict Thursday night in a trial to set damages. <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, representing the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, had argued that $ 600,000 would be a fair settlement for the loss of 280,000 trees at <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Himrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Himrod Citrus Nurseries. The nurseries had received $ 248,000 from the state and federal governments as compensation after their stock was destroyed. That amount will be deducted from the $ 1.5 million judgment. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> has a similar suit pending for the destruction of 510,000 trees. Statewide, more than 20 million nursery-stock or newly planted trees were burned after inspectors discovered what they thought was a virulent strain of incurable citrus canker in August 1984. It later was found to be a much less threatening form of disease and some nursery owners sued, claiming the burning unnecessary.

 Police seized 880 pounds of cocaine worth about $ 45 million and arrested 12 people Friday in what they described as the largest seizure of the drug in European history. Authorities believe the find could be linked to the `` Cartel de Medellin'' ring of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the alleged supplier of 80 percent of the cocaine to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, according to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> drug enforcement chief <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. Among the suspects arrested in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> were four Colombians, three Ecuadorians and a Spanish woman. The others were not identified. Police on Friday were still gathering the drug hidden inside prefabricated housing panels inside a warehouse in the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Fuenlabrada </LOCATION>. The total weight of the seizure could eventually surpass 880 pounds, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said the seizure capped an eight-month investigation. Authorities made a breakthrough when they tracked a container sent from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> to the port of <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>, which was later trucked east to the Fuenlabrada warehouse, he said.

<TEXT>
 An attempt by townspeople to protect mating salamanders from being killed by cars was thwarted when all but one of the amphibians ignored tunnels installed for them beneath a busy street. The 50 people who turned out in drizzle Thursday night to watch the first salamander crossing of the year ended up barricading the street and carrying about 40 of the yellow-spotted salamanders across to a breeding pond. The animals spend the winter hibernating in woods and try to reach the pond every spring with the first warm rain. Shouts went up when one salamander was discovered crawling along a fence leading to one of the tunnels under <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>. The salamander made it through in five minutes, 20 seconds, said <LOCATION> Shutesbury </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>. `` It was an historic event,'' <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said Friday. `` It was the first salamander to go through a tunnel all on its own.'' The world's first salamander tunnels were installed after a public outcry over the amphibians' plight. Many salamanders faced certain death when they slithered across the road. Local naturalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> persuaded town selectmen to close the street last year until all the salamanders, members of the mole salamander family, made the trek, which usually takes a week. The salamanders are not on the state's endangered species list, although the <LOCATION> Henry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> population is the last in town. The three 19-inch-high tunnels were donated by ACO Polymer Products of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and installed in November for about $ 2,000. Volunteers erected fences in January to guide the salamanders to the tunnels. The fences failed their first test, but townspeople said it was too early to tell how the whole experiment would fare. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said there were very few salamanders out Thursday night. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>, said the salamanders may have changed their usual migration pattern to start at a spot beyond the fence. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said they might have been hibernating between the fence and the road. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Minear </PERSON>, chairman of the board of selectmen, said the tunnels might not be wet enough for the discriminating amphibians. In any event, the salamanders took townspeople by surprise, said Mrs. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, one of the flashlight-toting helpers at the crossing. `` They came a little sooner than we were quite prepared for,'' she said. The town's superintendent of public works said he had n't yet hung the `` Salamander Crossing'' signs designed by <LOCATION> Shutesbury </LOCATION> fourth-grader <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Ogden YWCA May Lose Charter For Admitting Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OGDEN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Ogden YWCA has been warned that its national charter may be revoked and a reprimand issued over its decision to allow men as full members, the organization's director says. However, Director <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Littleton </PERSON> said no sanctions by the national <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would force her organization to reverse its decision. `` We're holding fast on this,'' <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said. `` We're not going to rescind our action.'' `` I became the first woman member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ogden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> recently,'' <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said. `` Would n't it be tacky of me to become the first woman member of Rotary, then tell members of Rotary they could not belong to the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> because they're men?'' The chapter's members voted unanimously Feb. 23 to extend full memberships to men. <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said she knows of no other among several thousand YWCAs to admit men. Since then, <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> has been contacted by national officials and told `` as soon as they receive the official notice of what we've done, they will begin official action against us.'' The national executive director of ther <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gwendoline </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, was the only person at the group's headquarters who could comment but she was out of the office Friday, said her assistant, <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Papasavas </PERSON>. The pending battle comes nearly a year after a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> could not revoke the charter of local clubs that complied with state laws by extending memberships to women. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Ogden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> extended full membership to males, about 30 men have joined, bringing total membership to about 400, <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said. The private, non-profit agency has numerous community programs, including literacy classes, a crisis center for battered women, treatment centers for abused children and pregnant teens and support groups for divorced or widowed people. `` We have about 300 volunteers in this organization and about 75 of them are men,'' <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said. `` We could n't run this organization without men.'' The opposition to male membership is based `` on old fears that men dominate women, that women will defer to men, and that we will lose control,'' she said. `` But that's old stuff. Nobody dominates anybody anymore. We're all working together much better _ men and women _ and the sexes do n't have to be afraid of each other anymore.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> proposed Friday creating at least one experimental district in each state with no holds barred on school reforms. Teachers, parents, school boards, local businesses and others involved in these 50 districts would have the union's blessings to `` turn their school systems upside down or inside out'' in pursuit of improvements, said <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. `` What we're proposing will say, ` Let's look at everything,''' she told a news conference. Asked if that would extend to merit pay plans, which her 1.85 million-member union has bitterly opposed, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't imagine that they would do that, but if they decide that's an experiment that they would like to try and they bring us a reasonable proposal, we would certainly consider that. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said she will ask her state affiliates to work with governors, legislators and state education officials to reach a consensus on designating `` at least one entire school district in every state as an experimental, living laboratory to fundamentally restructure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools.'' Bold action is needed to revive a school reform movement that has started to flag from insufficient funding, she said. Her proposal drew qualified praise from a persistent critic of the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of education. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> issued a statement from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> saying: `` It's rather ironic to hear a call for reform from the organization that has done the most to resist meaningful education reforms in recent years. But if they are serious, it will be a welcome and refreshing change to have <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> begin supporting real education reform.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>'s counterpart at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, has already scheduled a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to unveil what his union calls `` a new and practical plan for teachers to begin radically restructuring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s public schools.'' The AFT said <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> will outline `` a proposal that teachers be able to ` opt out' of traditional responsibilities to create, run and administer innovative ` mini-schools' within schools.'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>'s idea sounded like `` more of the same old thing'' and `` an example of the top-down kind of reform we and others are trying desperately to get away from.'' AFT affiliates in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, are already embarked on experiments giving local teachers more say in running schools. <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> has a peer review system to improve poor teachers or get them out of the classroom. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> also announced the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> will decide April 28 which Democratic presidential candidate to endorse, if any. Like most other unions, it has stayed on the political fence until the crowded field of candidates sorted itself out. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said her experimental school district idea must still be approved at the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> this July. But she already got a green light from the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful board of directors and has created a union committee on restructuring. `` In these 50 school districts, school employees, working through their local association, would join with school boards, parents, civic leaders and business to develop whatever innovative or creative program they deem appropriate to improve education,'' she said. `` Those 50 local communities would be free to turn their school systems upside down or inside out. They would be free to open their school doors to 4-year-olds, or end the arbitrary division of class periods into 50-minute chunks, or experiment with alternatives to student tracking,'' she said.

 Government distribution of surplus milk to needy families will resume on a temporary basis in June following a one-month suspension, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. `` At this time, we do not know if distribution of non-fat dry milk can be continued beyond June,'' Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced last month it would suspend milk and cheese distributions under the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the suspension was necessary because of dwindling inventories of the goods. The program began on orders from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981 when surpluses were piling up. The suspension announcement had drawn immediate fire from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Bode said Friday that a new upturn in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inventories prompted the June distribution of 8 million pounds of non-fat dry milk through local food banks. He said the department would monitor its inventories `` and keep states informed of availability.'' `` The same is true for cheese,'' he said. `` If we get more, we'll give it away.'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` pleased that there's an additional temporary supply for the month, but this does not address the long-term problem. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> has been calling for renewal of the TEFAP program, and he scheduled a grocery-bagging session in a downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> food bank on Monday morning in an effort to focus the spotlight on the hunger issue. The food giveaway program has distributed more than 5 billion pounds of surplus food worth more than $ 5 billion since 1981, the department said. Seven types of food have been provided: cheese, butter, non-fat dry milk, honey corn meal, flour and rice.

 The toddler who was trapped for 58 hours in an abandoned well celebrates her second birthday Saturday without the cameras and reporters that greeted her rescue last fall. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> and her parents, <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> and Chip, plan a quiet observance at home, said a spokesman, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. But a controversy between rival associations of rescuers over telling the tale for televison is far from quiet. The rescuers were among more than 200 firefighters, law enforcement officers, cave explorers, construction workers, drillers, welders and others who worked for three days to free <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> from the 8-inch well shaft. `` Personally, I hope it does n't get to the point where you're embarrassed to say you were involved in the rescue,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Galle </PERSON>, a caver who assisted at the well site <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>'s recreation superintendent, handled climbing harnesses for dusty workers who repeatedly descended a newly dug parallel shaft and bored horizontally through solid rock to reach the girl, 22 feet down. The two rescuers' groups _ one mostly volunteers and the other city officials and employees _ are negotiating separately with producers for a television movie. The <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> <PERSON> Rescuer </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of more than 30 volunteers, is committed to a movie deal with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> producer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

The other group, the <ORGANIZATION> McClure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, comprises 11 municipal officials and has not yet committed to work with a producer. The rescuers' gatherings started calmly enough. Some, in the spirit of solidarity and friendship, agreed to meet regularly for reunions and an informal group was created, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> mining expert. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s parents have not yet signed any movie agreements, said <PERSON> Snelson </PERSON>. `` It's a beautiful, heart-warming story'' that needs to be told in the right way, he said.

 A judge ruled that 80 children held by a masked gunman last month at a private school will not have to testify at a preliminary hearing next week. An attorney for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, charged with 84 counts of kidnapping in the daylong ordeal, had sought to subpoena the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> pupils for Tuesday's preliminary hearing. At a brief hearing Thursday, District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> accused defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> of trying to `` create a circus atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said the prosecutor `` is trying to create a lynch-mob atmosphere.'' `` I think some people have concluded that Mr. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is guilty and all this is a waste of time,'' <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said. `` Thelevision and read the papers. Everybody knows he's guilty.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is expected to be bound over to a <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury at next week's hearing. y saw him on te <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> and another man, both wearing ski masks, allegedly entered the <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> school Feb. 2 and took the 80 pupils and four teachers The other man, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, gave up a few hours later and charges eventually were dropped against him when authorities determined he had been tricked into the abduction. Twelve hours after the ordeal began, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> laid down his weapons and was arrested after watching a videotape of Gov. Guy Hunt signing a phony pcouch-potato economy'' that will be marked by low unemployment, more savings and rising productivity, economists and population experts say. The dawning of a couch-potato economy is the best thing that could happen to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after years of yuppie splurging, says <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, the economist who coined the term. `` Yuppies are slowing down. We're all getting older, a little less frivolous,'' <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, 38, director of economics and fixed-income research for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said this past week. Exhibit No. 1 in <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>'s case is the shift noted last year in consumer-spending priorities after the go-go years of 1985 and 1986. In 1985, the two fastest-growing segments were brokerage and investment fees and audio and video equipment. In 1986, the leaders were boats and recreational vehicles. In 1987, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> seemed to turn suddenly sedentary. Books and maps finished first, followed closely by funeral and burial expenses. The numbers from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may be misleading because the biggest percentage risers are small segments that fluctuate widely, but <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> is convinced that they tell a story. `` I'm not promising you that the transformation definitely happened in'87,'' but something is afoot, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said. He said the shift could point to an increased savings rate. `` And that should leave room for a boom in exports and a boom in capital spending. Which is not a bad mix at all.'' One reason for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s extraordinary success is its high savings rate, which creates a pool of money for investment. Trailing behind the American baby boomers is the `` baby-bust'' generation _ the smaller complement of workers that is entering the work force now. There are too few qualified baby busters to fill all the entry-level jobs. But <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> optimistically sees a positive side to that: It will force business to find ways to automate more, he says, increasing the nation's productivity. <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>'s ideas are supported by others, including <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographics </ORGANIZATION> magazine in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. As baby boomers settle down, they are beginning to put aside money for their children's education and their own retirement, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said But baby boomers will still be spending, too, something that is good news for producers of consumer goods. `` Baby boomers are entering their peak earnings years, so they will be able to spend more and save more at the same time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. In spite of the free-spending reputation of the young, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said, households headed by people aged 35 and over lead their juniors in every broad category of spending except two: alcohol and rented dwellings. The mix of spending is what is changing. Couch potatoes spend less money on movie tickets, more on things like VCRs. And, of course, couches. The changing habits of the nation are more than a myth. The <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> last year reported a poll finding that more than half of people over 30 prefer doing things at home, while more than half of people under 30 prefer doing things outside the home. The median age in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is rising, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> notes, and it has just passed 30. `` Everyone's tired,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 30, editor of the Public Pulse, a <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> newsletter. `` Some peole call it the cocooning phenomenon. Some people call it the couch-potato economy. We think it's mainly exhaustion.''

<HEAD>State `Rainy Day' Funds Usually Are Undernourished or Empty,
Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty-six states have established `` rainy day'' funds as a hedge against economic downturns, although seven states have put no money in them and most of the rest have n't put in enough to deal with serious financial troubles, a report issued Friday said. Two of the states, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, both suffering from the drop in energy prices, actually have drawn upon those reserves to avoid deep spending cuts and to keep their budgets balanced, the report said. `` That proves the funds are working,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheppach </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association, along with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, put together the report on the financial condition of the 50 states, `` Fiscal Survey of the States.'' In general, the report found that most states tightened their budget belts last year and are reluctant to start major new programs this year because of uncertainty about the economy. States such as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION> are facing tough financial times because of their reliance on the troubled energy industry. But the majority of states are in sound health, the report said. Still, that figure belies the fact that most states are close to the financial edge. The report found that the majority of states will end the year with only small budget balances. Those balances are expected to fall to 1.5 percent of total expenditures at the end of next fiscal year, the lowest level since the recession of 1983, when it was 1.3 percent. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, both with booming economies, are among the handful of states expecting to end the next fiscal year with large balances. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is projecting a $ 1.1 billion balance and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, $ 231 million. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, on the other hand, is the only state forecasting a deficit at the end of next fiscal year _ an estimated $ 731 million. The report also found that some states are putting money aside into contingency funds instead of counting unspent dollars as end-of-the-year balances. Such reserves are a relatively recent phenomenon, formed to buffer state finances from the disruptions of an uneven economy, the report said. But the funds, overall, are small. At the end of last fiscal year, the reserves totaled $ 2 billion, or just under 1 percent of expenditures, the report said. The amount of money in the reserves is expected to increase slightly to $ 2.3 billion at the end of this fiscal year, but that still will equal just 1 percent of expenditures. `` Clearly,'' the report said, `` small reserves can help relieve less serious fiscal conditions, but states will still be unprepared for an extended economic downturn.'' Seven of the states have yet to put money into their reserves: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the report said. The other 29 states that have established such reserves are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> -LRB- which refers to its program as a deficit elimination fund -RRB-, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> are considering creating a `` rainy day'' fund. Most states expect little fallout from last October's stock market collapse, although <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are planning for revenue losses. The report found that the economic picture generally differs by region, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in a strong financial position. One measure of its strength was its unemployment rate, which averaged 3.4 percent in 1987, far below the national rate of 6.2 percent. The <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> also boasts a strong economy, while recessions in the Midwestern farm states and Western energy states seem to have bottomed out, the report said. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, the economic picture is mixed, with some states, like <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, experiencing strong growth and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> facing economic hard times.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> stressed the value of celibacy in a letter sent to priests worldwide and released by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Friday. `` The analogy between the church and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> has a special eloquence for us, who link our priestly vocation to celibacy, that is, to making ourselves eunuchs for the sake of heaven,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in his annual Holy Week message to priests. In the past, the pope has washed the feet of 12 men in a Holy Thursday service to re-enact <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s last supper with his apostles, who are considered the first priests of the Roman Catholic church. Telling priests that their lives are the `` equivalent'' of `` spiritual fatherhood'' because the church has a special relationship with the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, the mother of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote: `` On Holy Thursday we need to deepen once again this mysterious truth of our vocation ...'' The pope urged priests to turn to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> for guidance in keeping their vocation, saying, `` it is necessary that our priestly choice of celibacy for the whole of our lives should also be placed within her heart.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> encouraged priests to `` seek also a proper relationship with women.'' As examples, he cited how <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> showed compassion to an adultress who was on the verge of being stoned by a crowd. He asked the spectators, according to the Gospel of <PERSON> John </PERSON>, `` Let him who is without sin ... be the first to cast a stone upon her.'' He noted also that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> first conveyed the `` Easter good news of his resurrection'' to women who had come to his tomb. `` By reason of his vocation and service, the priest must discover in a new way the question of the dignity and vocation of women both in the church and in today's world.'' The pope did not elaborate on what a church vocation could mean for women, who are barred from the priesthood.

<HEAD>World Jewish Congress Calls Austrian Reparations To Jews
`Desecration''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday condemned the payment voted by <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s parliament to compensate victims of Nazism as `` a desecration. The decision to grant between $ 200 and $ 400 to each victim `` represents a desecration of the memory of the victims of the Holocaust at the very moment of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s reflection on the 50th anniversary of its union with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said. The parliament in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to pay a one-time sum of $ 4 million to victims of Nazism. Some 68,000 Austrian Jews died in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, and more than 120,000 others were incarcerated in camps or fled the country. In all, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> exterminated some 6 million Jews. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>'s statement noted that the Austrian decision was in marked contrast to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 1952 agreement to compensate the victims of Nazism for life with monthly reparation payments. The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has been at the forefront of a two-year campaign to expose the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past of Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. `` The recent attention focused on <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past has exploded the long-held myth that <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> was a victim of Nazi persecution rather than its very willing collaborator,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said. A team of international historians found that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was implicated in Nazi persecution while serving as an officer in the German army during World War II.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he still thinks fired national security council aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is a hero and he does not believe any of the Iran-Contra criminal defendants committed a crime. Fielding questions after making a speech to young people representing the Center for the Study of the Presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he thought that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, along with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and other defendants, will be acquitted of charges brought against them in a federal grand jury indictment. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he could not understand why the arms-to-Iran initiative had become his administration's worst political scandal. `` I still think <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is a hero,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said when asked if he was considering a pardon for his former aide, who retired last week from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this week, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, along with arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, pleaded innocent to federal conspiracy and theft charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.

After telling his audience that the subject of pardons is `` something I ca n't discuss now,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added: `` I just have to believe that they're going to be found innocent because I do n't believe they're guilty of law-breaking of any kind.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said on past occasions that he did not believe any laws were broken in the affair, which came to public light in early November 1986.

<HEAD>Five Years Later, FDA Guidelines on Elderly Drugs Unenforceable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has yet to enact guidelines ensuring that manufacturers of new drugs test their medications on the elderly, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel was told Friday. Medical experts appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging said the guidelines, along with better labeling, were keys in curbing a `` disturbing frequency'' of harmful drug reactions among people over 60. On June 28, 1983, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Novitch </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> deputy commissioner, told the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> that the agency was developing standards to make sure elderly patients were included in tests of new drugs for ailments common to senior citizens. But the guidelines remain unpublished, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a statement the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel released Friday. `` Five years later, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is still dragging its feet,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., the committee's ranking Republican <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had not ignored the standards, but rather had been circulating them among drug companies in draft form for comments and fine-tuning. `` The guidelines are already being implemented in that the pharmaceutical industry is using them,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. But physician <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> told the panel that without final guidelines, there has been `` great variabiity in the eagerness with which drug companies have sought out the elderly in the investigational stages of a new drug.'' <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said there was a `` disturbing frequency'' of adverse drug reactions among senior citizens. Young did not appear in person for questioning, saying in a letter to committee chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., that he was notified two weeks ago and did not have had adequate time to prepare In 1986, people 60 and over accounted for at least 39 percent of 4,481 hospitalizations due to adverse reactions from medication, according to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> figures. But researchers have estimated the number of such hospitalizations might actually be much higher. Stereotypes of the elderly as confused, depressed, weak or diarrheic often cause health professionals to miss drug-related ailments, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON>, associate professor of pharmacy at <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Since the most common manifestations of adverse drug reactions in the elderly are precisely the same symptoms of this unfair stereotype, professionals who believe that aging is synonymous with deterioration of physical and mental function often overlook medications as the cause of their patients' deterioration,'' <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> was not being tough enough in ensuring that geriatric-specific information appeared on labels. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said in an interview that labeling would improve as better information became available about specific medications. Two other witnesses, <PERSON> Wilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of Golden Gate, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cray </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said their mothers had suffered needlessly because physicians had prescribed drugs that produced harmful reactions. Little said doctors had recommended over-the-counter antacids, laxatives and painkillers for her mother, <PERSON> Donnis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>. More importantly, she said, her mother's medicine cabinet was a `` mini-drug store'' of 14 prescription drugs, including medication to strengthen the heartbeat and regulate rhythm, control blood pressure and increase urine flow. She testified that her mother had been hospitalized after a January 1986 overdose left her `` sprawled and lifeless,'' and later confused. Ms. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said her mother, whom she declined to name, had become `` a vegetable'' from legal drug use.

 A giant quilt hand-sewn into the shape of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> in honor of the state's 100th birthday received rave reviews from about 500 people who inspected it in stocking feet. `` I'm proud of how it turned out,'' said <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennyson </PERSON>, 73, who coordinated the quilt's construction. `` A lot of people put a lot of time and effort into it. I think it's a good, clean way to celebrate our centennial.'' The quilt, which covered the entire floor of the Civic Memorial Auditorium, was measured Thursday night at 123 feet, 10 inches at its widest point and 75 feet, 9 inches deep. The measurements were taken by members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes the quilt will be confirmed as the world's largest by the Guinness Book of World Records. Guinness lists a Belgian quilt sewn in 1982 and measuring 69 feet, 6 inches by 99 feet, 5 inches and sewn as its current record. The centennial quilt contains 1,360 four-inch-square township blocks, many with carefully crafted symbols of the local landscape, natural resources and history. `` It's hard to imagine putting this all together with some of the detail that went into the work,'' said <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, who joined some 500 other spectators in viewing the quilt. Most of the spectators walked on the quilt in stocking feet to locate familiar landmarks or family farmsteads. Some knelt on all fours to get a closer look. More than 7,000 volunteers around the state worked on the project, which took 23 months to complete, according to Ms. <PERSON> Tennyson </PERSON>, who teaches arts and crafts in <LOCATION> Antler </LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota-Canada </LOCATION> border.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Alerting Supporters To Ideological Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government and the Contra rebels each claimed on Friday that its own military pressure helped force the other to yield to a cease-fire plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, in their newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION>, called on citizens to prepare for ideological warfare to defend the ruling party against the Contras. The Contras hinted that if peaceful measures do n't bring about democratic reforms, they are prepared take up arms again. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said there were no reports of combat on Friday, five days after the two sides agreed to suspend offensive operations. The temporary truce began at the start of three days of talks that ended with the signing of the plan Wednesday night. Under the pact, guns will remain silent until June 1, when a permanent cease-fire is to take effect. In addition to its regular edition, <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> distributed a special four-page edition Friday praising the pact that outlines steps to end the war, which has lasted more than six years. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON>'s regular edition said that with the agreement, the war will take on a new phase. `` On an internal political level, this means the incorporation of pressure groups, that even though disarmed, continue to be armed ideologically against the popular power and its conquests,'' it said in an editorial. `` This implies that while the warlike battles lessen or stop, the fight enters a new phase of political-ideological battles. `` The people should be ready for the new step to reach total peace, the continuation and the strengthening of the revolution and the power of the Sandinistas,'' it added. It ran a front-page caricature of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dressed as a magician and reaching into an empty high-top hat. The magician's rabbit, with the word `` Sapoa'' written on its chest, sat on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s head The cease-fire talks were held at the customs post outside the border village of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of the capital. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, a Contra spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed the cease-fire agreement `` because of the pressure _ military and political _ put on them by the -LRB- Nicaraguan -RRB- Resistance,'' as the rebels are formally known. `` The Resistance has been proposing this type of agreement since 1983 but the only response we had from them was insults,'' he said. But <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> indicated that if democracy is not reached with the cease-ire agreement that the Contras would renew their armed fight. `` If we ca n't do it peacefully, if the Sandinsitas do not want to achieve democracy, then the reasons Nicaraguans took up arms will still be there,'' he said. The rebels' Radio Liberacion quoted Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> as saying `` the signed truce does n't mean we have abandoned our fight -LRB- for democracy -RRB- in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' `` Our first way is peaceful, but this does not exclude other means if we are obligated to do so,'' he said. Contra sources have indicated that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' rejection of new aid to them in February was the major reason for signing the agreement. The other was that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> reportedly told the rebels the talks were the last chance to end the war. The Sandinistas are banking on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's lame duck status continuing to thwart its efforts to get new Contra aid. At the same time, they made some concessions to reach the agreement, which could ease severe internal problems that revolve around the draft, economic policies and the chronic shortages of food and basics. The Contras have been backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981 in their fight to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, who came to power in a popular revolutionary war. Government opponents say they promised democracy and delivered Marxism. Under the cease-fire agreement, the government will grant a gradual political amnesty and full press freedoms. The Contras may receive only non-lethal aid and it must be distributed by a neutral organization. All political exiles can return. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> delegation went to the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for a second day Friday. It was invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to prove its troops had not crossed into Honduran territory during an eight-day offensive that ended March 16 to rout Contras from base camps. Defense sources said Thursday the Sandinista army has pulled patrols from mountainous jungle regions in war zones to places where there are less likely to be clashes with the Contras. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the Honduran government have cited an incursion by 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> as the reason for sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week. Nicaraguan soldiers in the border region of thick jungle, mountains and a maze of rivers indicated they had crossed the Coco River dividing the two nations. The Sandinista offensive pushed about 1,800 rebels back into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, according to the government. Military sources indicated that the low number of battlefield deaths, put at 92 by the Sandinista army, did not mark a victory for government troops.

<HEAD>No. 666: Luxury Apartment Owners Move To Change `Satanic' Address</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> knew little about apocalyptic imagery in the Bible and cared less about satanic symbols until the new owners of her lakefront luxury building said it was no longer 666 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>. `` I never knew it had satanic connotations until one night when I was watching ` The Omen' on television,'' Ms. <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> said, referring to the 1976 movie in which a boy named <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> has the numbers `` 666'' on his scalp. `` When I saw that,'' she continued, `` I said to myself, ` Is n't that amazing He has our address on his head.' It actually made me feel kind of proud.'' The building's new owners and management felt differently. In a March 1 letter, they notified commercial leaseholders and occupants of the nearly 400 residential units that as of May 1, the building will be known as <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> at 680 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the owner, a <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, and the local management company, <ORGANIZATION> Golub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, say the address change had nothing to do with the devil. They say their intent was to disassociate the building from a spate of financial problems that befell its previous owner, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developer who bought the building in 1979 and lost a mortgage foreclosure battle with the bank last year. `` It certainly was n't us who raised this devil thing,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Golub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Some Chicagoans have taken to calling the building the Mark-of-the-Beast Building or the Devil's Building, apparently in light-hearted reference to passages from the book of Revelation in the New Testament. The book tells of a beast with two horns like a lamb that arose from the earth and caused every person to receive its mark on the right hand or the forehead. `` Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six,'' according to Revelation 13:18. Ms. <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> said a supervisor in the city department that approved the address change told her the owners specifically mentioned that `` 666 refers to the devil.'' If the owner's motive is open to debate, the inconvenience the name change will cause many tenants is not. `` They're fighting mad and ... we're talking about wealthy people, not the kind of people you'd expect to pick this kind of fight,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON>, 36, who makes her living writing and recording commercial jingles with her husband. `` I'd just bought a year's supply of client forms and checks: 10,000 envelopes with the wrong address were delivered four days before we were notified,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Wottrich </PERSON>, owner and president of A-Plus Talent Agency in the building. The tenants have collected $ 1,600 thus far and retained an attorney about making a legal challenge, Ms. <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON> said. The final blow to some tenants is n't even the name change. It's the new _ some say stuffy _ moniker of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> `` It's absolutely pretentious,'' said <PERSON> Zacharias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosner </PERSON>, another leader of the tenant uprising. `` It's like painting a <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> orange.''

 A U.S.-built rocket carrying a satellite with Italian, West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific experiments was launched from an Indian Ocean platform off the coast of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Friday night. The satellite will orbit the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on a yearlong mission to study the lower atmosphere. The Scout rocket, a four-stage, solid-fuel booster, rose in a plume of fire and smoke into a cloudless sky beneath a quarter moon. The launch at 10:55 p.m. came 12 hours after an original daylight launch was postponed. Weather forecasters had predicted a thunderstorm, which did not materialize. Aboard the 522-pound satellite was equipment from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Goddard Space Flight Center in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to measure the electric field outside the craft. Another experiment from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> will measure hot gases and ion winds surrounding the spacecraft. The Italian space agency sent a device designed to measure drag forces on the orbiting satellite, and the West German space agency sent equipment to measure solar ultraviolet radiation and radiation of interplanetary and intergalactic origin. The satellite, which will be monitored from a control room in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, will make a complete loop around the Earth, above the equator, every 100 minutes. Friday night's launch was the first from the Italian-run <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> since 1974. The range, 90 miles north of the port city of <LOCATION> Mombasa </LOCATION>, was established in 1965 and has been the site of eight previous launches, all of them involving Scout rockets. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rome </ORGANIZATION> operates the range. Friday's launch was conducted in collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marco </LOCATION> platform, named for the patron saint of navigators, is three miles offshore and similar to those used in offshore drilling. The Scout rocket is one of the most reliable ones used by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. Friday night's launch was the 53rd success out of 54 attempts in the past 20 years, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The launch had been postponed from last week because of mechanical problems.

 Soldiers opened fire Friday when a mob attacked a school they had occupied, killing two Arabs, and others stormed a mosque to pursue youths throwing stones, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and army reports. Witnesses and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 13 Palestinians were wounded at the school in <LOCATION> Tarqumia </LOCATION>, which was being converted into a temporary army headquarters. In nearby <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, soldiers shot at young Arabs on the roof of <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haras </LOCATION> mosque who pelted them with rocks and raised the outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag after midday prayers. Hospital officials said four Arabs were wounded. About 30 soldiers stormed the mosque, yanked down the flags and lined up dozens of teen-agers against a wall. The army said 50 were arrested. Troopers stormed <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> later and arrested six young Arabs who barricaded themselves on the roof, flinging stones at soldiers and passing cars, the army reported.

 <PERSON> Varryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says her family had two choices: `` It was either come here to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tammany </LOCATION> and live in a tent or stay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and live in the streets.'' St. Tammany gave the family an unexpected third choice _ to move the tent because it was violating sanitation and building codes. However, the deputy who ordered them to move put them in touch with a church, which is helping them find a home. `` We have no relatives around here and did n't know anybody,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We had no place to go. My husband's disabled and I do n't have a job. If it was n't for the churches, we would be some pitiful people.'' The <PERSON> Thomases </PERSON>' problems began in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> about a month ago, when the house they were living in was sold. They'd been living rent-free in exchange for watching the property, Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We did n't have enough money to rent a new house,'' she said. `` Rent there is about $ 175. Plus you have to have that much more for a damage deposit and more money for utility deposits.'' They took their $ 277 monthly welfare check and every penny they could scrape up and made a $ 200 down payment on a 75-by-125-foot lot in a subdivision near <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>. Last weekend, they loaded their belongings in plastic garbage bags, put them on a small pickup truck and drove across the Causeway to their new lot. Several of the bags blew into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION> on the way over. `` That did n't help matters,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Their 9-by-12-foot tent made it, however. The family improvised an outhouse from a blue tarpaulin over a hole in the ground. The couple and their children _ <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 4, <PERSON> Alaster </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Luwana </PERSON>, 6 _ planned to live there until they could afford to build a small house. `` We did n't know we were n't supposed to put up a tent on the lot,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We were told the only thing you could n't put on the lot was a trailer. After learning the family's plight, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tammany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> sheriff's deputy who ordered them to move called <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anselm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>. Deacon <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Baham </PERSON> put the family up in a motel for the rest of the weekend and found them a house in <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The church paid $ 100 for a month's rent and the <ORGANIZATION> Covington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Vincentian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> gave the family food, said food bank manager <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the family paid $ 200 down and $ 125 in closing costs for the $ 9,500 lot. The 17-year mortgage was to be paid at $ 95 a month. `` We were going to try to pay it out of our welfare check, I guess. And I was hoping to find a job,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said the Vincentian Center is trying to find a job for Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who has worked as an auto mechanic. `` But I'll do anything at all,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I'm not choosy about a job. I went to three places today, but they did n't have any openings.

 A shy `` caveman'' with a toy gun and a man who allegedly drove him to stickups and ordered him to hide in the cave are suspected of at least 16 robberies, police said Friday. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON>, 24, of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, was lured from his cave by undercover officers who promised him cigarettes and a hot meal, then arrested him, said Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON>. `` He looked like <PERSON> Grizzly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> without the long beard,'' said <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON>. `` He wore an old ragged jacket, dirty pants and sneakers and he smelled pretty bad.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON>, 37, of <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerrito </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> claims took him to the robberies and told him to stay in the cave, also was arrested for the robberies that netted a total of about $ 1,500 since March 7, <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> would drive <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> to the places they would rob, convenience stores, florist shops, ice cream parlors and liquor stores, easy places to hit,'' <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said. `` Steffani would walk in, throw a bag on the counter, say ` This is a stickup,' show the gun in his belt and tell them to fill the bag.'' No one was hurt in any of the holdups. `` We did n't believe it at first when we heard a caveman was pulling these robberies,'' <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said. `` But it turned out to be true.'' In an apparent suicide attempt, <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> stuck a key into an electrical outlet in a police interview room Thursday after admitting his involvement in the robberies, <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said. He was knocked unconscious and was hospitalized overnight for observation. <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> also were being treated for heroin and cocaine addiction, <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> told police he's been addicted to the tranquilizer Valium since he was 14 and was afraid to be around people without the drug. <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> split the money from the robberies, <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said, and apparently used it to buy drugs. Police said <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> befriended <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> last Christmas and lived with him in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cerrito </LOCATION> until last week, when he took <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> to the cave above the tiny town of Canyon. Only a few friends knew of <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON>'s hiding place, said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>. They and <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> would drive to the area with food and supplies and honk their horns. <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> would come out of his hiding place, see who it was and either `` get the things or run back into the bushes and hide,'' <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said police were tipped off by an informant. Undercover officers went to arrest <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> late Wednesday night and honked their horn. At first, <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> said, all the officers could see was `` eyes in the bushes.'' <PERSON> Steffani </PERSON> eventually gave up without a struggle. <PERSON> Hawtin </PERSON> was arrested the next day, and a plastic replica handgun allegedly used in the robberies was found in his car, <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, voting 92-0, urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday to increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic pressure against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as part of a campaign to drive him from office. The unanimous vote was intended to demonstrate <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> has lost all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. The non-binding resolution also urged the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to consider `` a comprehensive package of emergency financial and other economic assistance'' to help a democratic successor government rebuild <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. An administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said, `` We have been aware of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution for days and consider it to be completely complementary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` The impression in all our minds is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He will go, and this will help him down the slippery slope,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` To Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, we say step aside now, while you still have the chance _ for your own sake and for your family'' s future,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., a principal sponsor of the resolution The resolution declared that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military rule and his alleged involvement in large-scale international drug running and money laundering represent `` an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' But senators stressed that any action the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> takes against <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> is in response to the direct request of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Devalle </PERSON>, who was ousted as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s chief executive on Feb. 25 after trying unsuccessfully to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` This battle is going to be won or lost by the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` But I think it is important that in this struggle they know where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands.'' Several senators urged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to reconsider his refusal of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offer not to seek his extradition for trial on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics-trafficking charges if he gives up power and goes into exile in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> needs to know that offer is not good forever _ and that he will not be free to pursue his sordid activities without fear of paying the consequences,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn. `` If he thinks this is the end of it _ if he feels this is all we are going to do _ he'd better think again,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> `` This is a man who is a symbol for destroying liberty. Among the options available to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the imposition of a total trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a step the administration has resisted in favor of a more measured, incremental approach. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> originally called for such action before joining forces behind the resolution approved Friday. After two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with multimillion-dollar drug trafficking and money laundering, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cut off the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses dollars as its own currency and the move paralyzed the Panamanian banking system. Before meeting in the Oval Office with Dominican President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might seek exile in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. `` No,'' he replied. `` That's not far enough.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution at a departure ceremony for <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, said, `` We're considering everything, but I ca n't take any questions.'' <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> that he would grant asylum to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if asked. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to release $ 250,000 in emergency funds to buy food for the poor in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The food will be purchased in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if it is available and distributed through <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic relief agency, said AID spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunder </PERSON>.

 There will be no organized union boost behind a single candidate in Saturday's Democratic caucuses in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a state where union members can wield more clout than almost anywhere else. While national labor leaders are assuming <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be the eventual nominee, they are prevented from endorsing him by what appears to be growing rank-and-file support for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has gotten more union votes than any of the other candidates in primaries so far. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also has considerable union support. None of the Democratic candidates appears to have won the hearts _ or votes _ of a majority of the state's 750,000 rank-and-file union workers, nearly half of them members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> has held out the possibility of an endorsement before the Democratic National Convention in July if it appears that two-thirds of the labor federation's 14.2 million members have agreed on a favorite. So far they have n't. Exit polls from the March 8 Southern primaries showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> holding the greatest support among union members at 37 percent, followed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 25 percent. `` There's not going to be an endorsement before the covention,'' <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, who also is an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said this week. Despite <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>'s known affection for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the union itself has carefully maintained an official position of neutrality in accord with <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. So have the other big unions in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> with 72,000 members, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> with 60,000, the Service Employees with 27,000 and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> with 24,000. But that `` neutrality'' by the international unions has n't prevented their former leaders and the hundreds of local union officers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> from taking sides <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, former president of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state labor federation, endorsed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on Friday. Former <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> earlier this month. `` It's kind of schizophrenic, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogar </PERSON>, a spokeman for the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of the unions here have people in everybody's camp.'' <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is running separate sets of get-out-the-vote phone banks on behalf of both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the clear favorite of their national leaders, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has the endorsement of the union's top officials in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Half the presidents of the 40 locals representing about 85 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000 members in the state have endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But the other 20 locals appear equally divided between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` I personally came out for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> but I've taken a lot of heat for it because he supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax law,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shukwit </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> Local 4008 in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` But I do n't think we've seen the candidate yet,'' <PERSON> Shukwit </PERSON> added, indicating a lingering dream among many trade unionists that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> might emerge as an alternative. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> remains the most important labor voice in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. And it has taken several steps to dissociate itself from the endorsement its 10,000 members in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> in February. For example, the union is running TV commercials in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> stressing a need for an activist government. Prior to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, it ran ads in that state focusing on the trade issue <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has championed. One <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, the union's president, probably believes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to be the nominee and does n't want to stir trouble with him. At the same time, endorsing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would infuriate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> loyalists among blacks, about 25 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s membership, and <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, a large contingent of its <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, the official said. Nonetheless, another union official predicted that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> will fare much better in Saturday's caucuses than he has in polls over the past two weeks in the state, which has lost 400,000 union jobs to imports since 1982. That official mentioned an internal poll showing <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> holding a narrow lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a distant third among union members.

 A high-ranking official indicated Friday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might take action if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fails to deal with long-range Chinese missiles sold to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Other officials, however, denied that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was considering an attack on the Arab kingdom. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a tradition of not standing by quietly when there is a real threat against it,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, a senior aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` The question is if this is a threat or not. There are people to deal with it, the Cabinet, the government.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> recently acquired the CSS-2 missiles, which have a range of 2,200 miles, enough to strike anywhere in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. They also are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Both the Chinese and the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> said the missiles wo n't be armed with such warheads, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has said it purchased the weapons to deter attacks on its territory during the Iran-Iraq war. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported Friday that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> issued a warning through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it would use any remaining missiles to strike at the Jewish state if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> attempted a pre-emptive strike. <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> said the issue should be left for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, `` who told us they are going to deal with the matter the best they can, both in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources as saying the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> air force has been conducting unusually intensive low-lewel bombing practice. It said such runs could be preparation for a strike on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, though there was no hard evidence to support that interpretation. The paper also noted that such exercises could help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> prepare for raids on Palestinian targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, denied that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had made any threats. `` We did take up our concern with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But we never made any threat against <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>,'' he said. Earlier reports of a similar <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> statement sparked strong warnings from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern. The Syrian government said Monday that `` any agression against the sister Saudi Arabian kingdom would obviously be an attack against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said he sent an urgent message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asking him to `` use his influence with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and urge it to stop threatening <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in such irresponsible way.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to have peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> were `` overreacting to a report that has been denied.'' The official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was going to mount a diplomatic campaign to `` take the missiles out,'' but stressed that `` we never made any threat to take them out militarily.''

 Moslem countries ended an international conference Friday by denouncing an absent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for riots last year in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and for refusing to sign a cease-fire in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> had stormed out of the five-day meeting Thursday. It complained that the 46-member conference was only serving the interests of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, its enemy in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war The foreign ministers and other officials of Moslem nations worldwide, in their final communique, lamented what they called `` terrorism'' by Iranian rioters in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in July, according to <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>. They also praised Saudi measures, announced Thursday, to control future disorders. The rioting occurred as Saudis tried to stop Iranian pilgrims at the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> from marching in a political demonstration. The violence left 402 people dead, including 275 Iranians and 80 Saudi security men. The Moslem nations specifically approved the Saudis' decision to set limits on the number of pilgrims traveling to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> this year. <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, who chaired the final session of the gathering, said the conference also agreed to `` make extensive efforts to force the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to take the necessary measures to force <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598. That document calls for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and a return to international borders. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it first wants its enemy branded as the aggressor. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a mainly Persian nation, has often been the target of criticisms from Arab lands. The conference also: _ Declared its support for Palestinian protests in the Israeli-occupied territories. However, no specific action was given. _ Welcomed Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer to pull troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and called for it to be put into effect immediately. _ Asked non-Islamic countries with Moslem populations, such as <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, to take steps to guarantee the rights of the minorities. _ Withheld full recognition of Moslem rebels from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> who are fighting the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, saying `` I can read the numbers and I know probably what's going to happen,'' conceded Friday that his uphill race against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the Republican presidential nomination appears doomed. In downbeat comments that departed from his prepared text, the senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who has 178 delegates to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 788 in the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tally, told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>: `` I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side.'' However, a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman later said the candidate is n't ready to abandon the race. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> himself suggested he was re-evaluating his campaign. `` Whatever happens in the next few days or the next few weeks, I still have some things I want to say,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the business group, which gave him a standing ovation. `` I intend to be a leader in my party. Whatever the role may be, it will be a role of leadership, constructive leadership, keeping the White House Republican,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> added. Speaking with reporters afterward, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> gave a clear indication that, at the very least, he would scale back his campaign appearances. `` I said I had a different strategy, and I think you're seeing some of it,'' he said. Asked about his change in tone and comments that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victory seemed a `` foregone conclusion,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters: `` I can read the numbers and I know probably what's going to happen.'' After finishing first in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Republican caucuses Feb. 8, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> lost a series of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> events to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including a defeat in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Feb. 16 and losses in the big round of primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday March 8. Despite his poor showings, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had vowed to press ahead with his campaign. But on Friday he told reporters: `` My view is that there's some things I want to say in this campaign and I think sometimes if you're not out there making four or five stops a day, people are more apt to listen.'' Asked if these were things he planned to say on his way out of the race, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` No. I'm not going out. I'm just going out of here,'' meaning the building where he had been speaking. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman, later said that despite <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s comments, `` we have n't made any official announcements'' on a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> withdrawal from the race `` His hallmark is his candor, and today's statement reflects that,'' <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said. `` We're the underdog, the big underdog. We've never said anything different about that We know the numbers and we know what the score is.'' `` But that does n't mean we have to give up. We have to re-evaluate the campaign day by day,'' <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was asked by reporters whether he planned to push on at least to the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on April 5, he replied: `` I may tell you that later this week, probably next week.'' In his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> opened on a pessimistic note. `` I've been saying now for some time as a candidate all the things I thought we should focus on and nobody really seems to care,'' he said. `` But I still have some things to say,'' he added. `` Lo and behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find more people willing to listen.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the business audience that `` it's going to be a tough race'' for Republicans this year and it was time for the party to pull together. `` We need to keep a Republican in the White House. That's where I'm coming from. And if it ca n't be me, it will be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I'm not here in a partisan sense. I'm not going to attack any Republican,'' he added. Turning to congressional races, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said: `` If I can count, the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be dealing with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He told his audience that the federal budget deficit, $ 150 billion last year, was `` public enemy No. 1'' and reiterated his proposal for a one-year across-the-board freeze on all federal spending.

 A strong earthquake occurred in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> Friday and was felt over a wide area of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey said The tremor was recorded at a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and occurred at 12:37 p.m. MST. <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> earthquake monitors in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said seismographs placed the center of the earthquake about 320 miles west of <LOCATION> Yellowknife </LOCATION>, the capital of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION>. Early reports said the tremor was felt over a wide area, including at <LOCATION> Yellowknife </LOCATION>; at <LOCATION> Whitehorse </LOCATION>, the capital of the Yukon Territory; and at <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> scientists said two other strong earthquakes occurred in the same general area late in 1985: a magnitude 6.6 tremor Oct. 5 and a magnitude 6.9 earthquake two days before Christmas on Dec. 23. The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage in a populated area, a quake of magnitude 5 considerable damage, a magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude 7 widespread, heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake, a `` great'' earthquake capable of tremendous damage. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.

<HEAD>Administration Tries Again To Allow Home Apparel Making</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration launched a final attempt Friday to overturn a 46-year-old law that prohibits manufacturers from hiring people to produce apparel in their homes. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it will publish proposed regulations next week that would allow employers to contract work from people in their homes in five industries: gloves and mittens, embroideries, buttons and buckles, hankerchiefs and some jewelry. However, unlike its two previous attempts to deregulate so-called industrial homework, officials said this time they will not try to remove the ban on women's apparel. Also, any allowed jewelry work would be limited to stringing beads and packaging. Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said excluding women's apparel, where investigators have found about half of the violations of the current law, was aimed at defusing opposition from the 210,000-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> However, the president of that union, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>, said it will vigorously oppose any relaxation of the current ban, calling the administration's latest proposal `` a betrayal of the rights and protections held by American workers for generations.'' `` We will take legal action as we have in the past,'' he said, indicating that the union will likely seek to overturn any changes in the courts if the administration tries to implement them. Officials for the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> indicated said they also anticipate filing court challenges to any attempt to lift the current bans. <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said he also has asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> labor committees to launch investigations of what he called the administration's `` unwillingness'' durig the past seven years to enforce the current prohibitions on industrial homework. The proposed new regulations do not attempt to overturn state bans on the same type of work at home in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ILGWU </ORGANIZATION>, other unions and employer associations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> led a firestorm of attacks on the administration's last two efforts in 1981 and 1986 to repeal the industrial homework bans As a result, only the ban on knitted outerwear was lifted in December 1984. <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said his union's review of government records show that since then only 72 knitted outwear employers have been granted licenses to contract out work to a total of less than 1,000 home workers `` in a universe that is 10 to 15 times that size.'' `` We recognize what's happening; we're not fooled,'' he said. `` If they get these bans, they'll come after us next. They've had this licensing program in outerwear for 40 months now and they've found violations in 80 percent of the cases they've looked at It has n't worked.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said the government does not know how many people in the five industries that employers have illegally contracted to work at home, citing estimates by others ranging from 10,000 to 100,000. `` What we've got is a balance of more enforcment techniques and increased flexibility in attempting to open up new opportunities,'' he said. `` The underlying policy is that people ought to have the freedom to work at home.'' The latest proposal will be open for 30 days of public comment after it is published in the Federal Register next week. Despite expected challenges from unions and anticipated court appeals, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said the administration hopes to have the prohibitions removed before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. `` It seems to me we ought to be able to get a final rule sometime this summer,'' he said. The current prohibitions were adopted between 1941 and 1943 under the Fair Labor Standards Act in response to what then was preceived as rampant exploitation of mostly immigrant home workers paid on a piecework basis. Removing them was a cornerstone of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaigns in 1980 and 1984. And business groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> have won repeated promises from adminstration officials that it is the one thing that will be accomplished before he leaves office. `` The recommendations of this administration demonstrate it has learned nothing from history,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The record shows that industrial homework has brought nothing but unfair competition, long hours and low wages for our poorest and most disadvantaged workers.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, however, said unions have not yet had a chance to study the latest proposal, which includes what he called a new set of `` enforcement teeth'' such as requiring bonds from employers with past records of paying less than minimum wages or other labor law violations.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sailed to a record victory Friday in local elections, marking stiff local opposition to Spanish claims of sovereignty over the British colony. In his first comments to reporters after his win, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON>, who rejects Spanish demands for a return of sovereignty over the enclave at its southernmost tip, restated his objection to a 1984 <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> accord. In that document, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the first time agreed to discuss sovereignty with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ceded control over the 2-square-mile limestone rock to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1713 following its defeat in the War of Succession. <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> also said he intended to start his four-year term as new chief minister with objections to a British-Spanish accord in December allowing <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> access to the colony's commercial airport and partial control of its administration. A conservative <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> party leader publicly expressed worry about the election results. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruperez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON>'s position `` makes it evident we're headed for stormy times.'' Final election results showed <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> received 8,128 votes or 58 percent of votes cast Thursday to unseat incumbent Chief Minister <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON> of the long dominant centrist Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights. <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON>, a protege of longtime party leader Sir <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, received 4,442 votes or 29 percent of the total. Also reacting to final results Friday in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>, a spokesman for the government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, said the election results would have no effect on <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s claims on the colony and its ongoing dialogue with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` The elections are of great importance for the colony itself, but they will not affect the nature of the British-Spanish negotiating process and discussions on cooperation on <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, including the question of sovereignty,'' he said. <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> told reporters Friday he was prepared to meet with <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to discuss bilateral issues. But such a meeting appeared unlikely because <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> accepts <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as its only legitimate negotiating partner on the matter. <PERSON> Bossano </PERSON> heads the 7,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the sole industrial union in the colony. He won fame for gaining parity in pay with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for workers at the colony's shipyard. His party won eight votes in the 15-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Canepa </PERSON>'s party gained the other seven.

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a longtime opponent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, said Friday he would support aid to the rebels to support the new ceasefire and the regional peace plan of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. In a final day of campaigning for Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised the ceasefire agreement reached this week in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to support it. `` After seven years of a failed and illegal policy, it is time for the administration to ... get behind the peace plan _ not next week, not next month, but now,'' he told reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union hall in this Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, suburb. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is leading in opinion polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but he warned his supporters not to take anything for granted. `` Friends, you're looking at a guy who was 50 points ahead in the polls in 1978 when I first ran for re-election ... and I lost,'' he said. `` I do n't pay any attention to the polls and I hope you do n't.'' `` It's a very important state. If we can do well here, it will be a giant step on the road to the nomination and the presidency,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He had planned a full day of campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but logistical problems snarled those plans. Bad weather kept <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from returning to the state early Friday morning, causing cancelation of events in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION>. He held a town meeting with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers and retirees in <LOCATION> Comstock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and then held a final rally in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had emphasized repeatedly his opposition to all aid to the Contras. Asked Friday if he supported any aid to the Contras now _ as laid out in the ceasefire agreement _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters: `` Only if it is for the very limited purpose of carrying out the provisions of the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan ... providing it is channeled through international relief agencies, neutral agencies and not the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the agencies of the federal government.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he does n't want the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to handle the money because `` I do n't trust this administration to provide that aid directly.'' Asked if his position is consistent with his earlier stance that `` not one dollar'' of aid go to the Contras, he replied: `` Yes, because this is for the purpose of implementing the peace plan.'' He said the `` non-lethal'' or `` humanitarian'' aid proposed in the past for the Contras was for the purpose of pursuing the war against the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` ` Non-lethal' or ` humanitarian' or ` the resistance' _ all of this stuff is PR stuff coming out of the administration. I do n't buy it We ought to decide what we are talking about here. A great deal of the aid that was called non-lethal was direct aid for the Contras. And I think we know that. `` If what we are about here is genuinely implementing the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan or the ceasefire or both, then it may make sense to provide some assistance through international relief agencies,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> said Friday he would grant asylum to Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if asked, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> is n't far enough away. <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We are willing to receive anyone who has political problems. If Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or anybody else requests our hospitality, we would give it to them, not because we agree with his regime, but rather that the traditional policy of our country has been one of open doors to all political refugees.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked whether he expected <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to go to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, replied, `` No, that's not far enough.'' A senior administration official said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to this remark during his private 50-minute meeting with <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>, but the veteran <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> leader did not respond. The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said, `` We do not believe that having him -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- that close to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a sensible move.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it would not seek his extradition if he would agree to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and take asylum in an agreed-upon country elsewhere. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has offered him exile. The apparent disagreement over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> came during a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit in which <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, other administration officials and senators and expressed hope that his pleas for higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar quotas would be heeded. `` There are problems which subsist in our relations, especially in connection with the lowering of our sugar quota, but this we have discussed with president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and with his senior advisors in this area of expertise,'' <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> said in a departure statement. `` We also discussed the subject this morning on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with a number of senators who are friends of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We found there a very receptive climate and feel confident that the problem will be solved, taking into account the interests of both our countries.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his remarks at the departure ceremony on a porch facing the White House Rose Garden, did not refer to the issue of sugar quotas, a touchy issue with the Dominicans since sugar is their major crop. The annual quota for sugar imports from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been reduced from about 750,000 tons in the early 1980s to 123,000 tons this year. The senior official said the administration will continue to press <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar policy. He said <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> `` asked for help,'' both with the sugar quotas and with the declining levels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would make available $ 10 million worth of surplus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, providing the Dominicans with food as well as $ 10 million in foreign exchange, the official said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his departure remarks, said, `` Within our budget limitations, we will continue to support development and growth in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will begin a series of mock inspections next month to prepare its new force of arms control inspectors and escorts to deal with Soviet facilities and personnel, a ranking <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. The exercises will be staged at the 21 sites in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where Soviet inspectors will be allowed to visit to ensure compliance with a treaty banning intermediate and shorter-range nuclear missiles, the official added. The mock inspections will begin April 6 and should be completed by May 10, hopefully in plenty of time to allow final preparations for the real inspections that will begin 30 days after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratifies the pact, the source said.

Signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 8, the treaty specifies that all nuclear missiles in the two superpower arsenals with a range of roughly 300 miles to 3,500 miles be destroyed within three years. The <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for escorting Soviet inspectors who travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sites in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to monitor the removal and destruction of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, as well as performing the same role inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by visiting Russian facilities and deployment sites. The official said next month's practice sessions would involve both inspectors and escorts, with the inspectors pretending to be Soviet officials who are met by the American escorts. Under the treaty, there are 10 sites open to Soviet inspection inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and another 11 in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. All 21 sites will be tested to ensure they're ready for hosting <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> inspectors, the official said. `` And we will challenge them -LRB- the escorts -RRB- with all kinds of possible variances in the -LRB- inspection -RRB- routine,'' said the source. According to the official, the task of staffing the <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION> has now been completed. The agency will keep in place 20 teams of 10 members each for the inspections, plus a headquarters' staff of 50 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Perhaps a third of the inspectors are women, the official said, and a sufficient number of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> linguists have been located, although with some difficulty. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for providing the aircraft and crews needed to ferry American inspectors to two `` entry points'' into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and to move <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> inspectors around inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official continued. The two entry points for the Russians will be <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> intends to inform the news media when the Soviets arrive for spot inspections, the source said. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, and his Soviet counterpart have already met once _ during a technical meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> earlier this month _ and will meet again in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> starting April 12, the official continued. The technical meetings are being held to sort out questions about the type of monitoring and survey equipment that will be used by the inspectors, the source said.

 <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> knew it was Thursday once again when officials served up beef stew in Gallery One of the Model Prison. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a 23-year-old free-lance photographer from <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has been marking off the days in his stark white cell for more than a year, ever since a Spanish Civil Guard found more than four pounds of cocaine in a suitcase registered in his name. `` I do n't belong in here because I'm innocent, and if this were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I would have been out a long time ago,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said in an interview in this 85-year-old prison in the heart of downtown <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, whose case has drawn the attention of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, is to stand trial Saturday before a three-judge panel. The prosecution is asking for a 10-year sentence. He arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s El Prat airport on March 13, 1987 _ Friday the 13th _ on a flight from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. He said he was on his way to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the first time to shoot pictures for tourist agency travel brochures. `` I was working as a free-lance, and the guy offered me $ 1,000 for four days' work. I like to travel, so I accepted and thought I was taking a suitcase full of travel brochures and film to someone in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was booked on charges of cocaine smuggling, denied bail and taken to the <LOCATION> Modelo </LOCATION>, as the jail is known here. `` This is the worst jail in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the oldest and the most-crowded,'' said guard <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobedo </PERSON>. `` It was meant to hold 600 people, but there are about 2,400 in here now.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, as of last month there were 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in jail in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Six are serving prison terms following conviction on drug-related charges, and another nine, including <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, are awaiting trial. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Campa </PERSON>, plans to enter as evidence results of a polygraph test administered to <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> by an agent of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which she says indicates <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> is telling the truth about his photo job and the suitcase. On Feb. 5, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, the man who offered <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> the job, pleaded guilty in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to a drug conspiracy count. He told the court he had shared a hotel room with <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and planted the cocaine-lined suitcase on the unsuspecting photographer. <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> received a two-year suspended sentence and a promise he would not be extradited to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in return for his cooperation. Following his testimony, three Spaniards and three Bolivians, all fugitives, were indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on cocaine conspiracy charges in connection with the case. `` It was my parents who first confronted <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, because my cousin <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrales </PERSON> knew him and he lived in the area,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` At first he denied everything, but then he told the truth.'' When <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to sign an annex to a 1970 extradition treaty Feb. 9, he also handed over copies of <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>'s statement to Spanish judicial authorities. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> is a 1986 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and in 1984 was a summer intern in Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office. The walls of the halls leading to the five sections of the prison are decorated with travel posters for <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>, the region in which <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> is located, and neighboring <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said what he has seen of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> consists of the <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> airport, the court where he was arraigned and the Modelo. During his year in jail <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> has read 150 books, written letters and walked miles around the patio during the daily morning and afternoon recreation periods. Guards in Spanish jails are unarmed, and inmates wear street clothes. Prisoners in the Modelo are allowed one, one-hour conjugal visit every month with a woman of their choice. `` It's the boredom that gets you more than anything, the lack of stimulating conversation, someone to talk about serious things with,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should think very carefully before permitting highly secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine technology to be sold to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, two senators said Friday. `` This is a decision that should be very carefully scrutinized before we decide to go ahead,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> strategic weapons subcommittee, in a speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor `` We have a number of questions which need to be answered before this decision is made,'' agreed Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> last year proposed to construct a fleet of 10 to 12 nuclear-powered submarines and is considering building boats which are updated versions of the British Trafalgar-class subs or the French Rubis-class subs. The Trafalgars use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology, which means the information could not be supplied to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by the British unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> approves, both <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. If the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> decides to permit <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to use the American technology, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could block the plan within 90 days if both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> pass resolutions of disapproval, <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> added. The Pentagon has not yet decided to grant a waiver to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week. <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear-powered sub technology had only been transferred once in the past, to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and he questioned whether <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has `` the money and the enormous infrastructure'' needed to safely operate the subs. `` In this era of nuclear phobia, we must maintain and enhance our shipboard standards of nuclear propulsion,'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. Any accidents aboard Canadian subs which involve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology would raise fears about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subs and could hamper the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s operation, he told his colleagues <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, `` before we approve this decision, we need to know how <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> proposes to fund this program, how <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> proposes to insure that the standard of nuclear safety will be at least as high as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the British.'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said the technology involved may be outdated and he noted that the Soviets are building a bigger, faster class of attack boats.

<TEXT>
 A 3-year-old boy scalded to death in a welfare hotel reportedly was removed from foster care and returned to his mother and father last summer despite a judge's reservations. Police have charged that the mother, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, 21, murdered <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> by holding him in 136-degree water because he had soiled his diaper. The boy's father, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, 23, has been charged with beating him earlier that day. The <ORGANIZATION> McKenzies </ORGANIZATION> received custody of <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> and his older sister, <PERSON> Tanisha </PERSON>, after Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquirol </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> dismissed a case brought in December 1986 by city child welfare authorities. The city sought to remove the children from the <ORGANIZATION> McKenzies </ORGANIZATION> on grounds that the father had beaten <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> at a shelter in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> where the family then was living. New York Newsday and the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that after numerous delays during which the city produced no evidence of a beating, <PERSON> Esquirol </PERSON> dismissed the case May 26. The judge stayed return of the children to June 3 and urged that city or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> officials refile the case. `` I know I certainly did n't want to return the children. The mother had admitted to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> authorities that the father beat her and the children,'' the judge told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was very, very frustrating.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinker </PERSON>, head of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, has declined to comment before completion of an investigation of his agency's handling of the case. <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> had spent more than half his 41-month life in foster care or hospitals, including the first six months of his life. He weighed only 1.8 pounds when he was born prematurely.

<HEAD>Court Papers Reveal Alleged Details on Body Found in Police
Chief's Yard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE RECHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KEENE, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sworn statements that led authorities to dig up a body in a police chief's yard tell of a friendship that allegedly developed into wife-swapping but ended in homicide. A District Court judge allowed the affidavits to be released Friday, a week after he rejected arguments by the state attorney general that they should be sealed to protect a continuing homicide investigation. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who resigned as part-time chief after the body was found, has said through his lawyer that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. No charges have been filed. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisti </PERSON>, a public defender representing <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, called the affidavits `` low-quality, unsubstantiated blatant hearsay.'' The attorney general's office said Friday it was satisfied with the progress of the investigation and expected an arrest, though it did not say when. According to sworn statements given by <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' sister, his niece and a brother-in-law, the following story emerges: Chambers, 36, and good friend <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, then 25, worked together at a factory in <LOCATION> Keene </LOCATION>, and `` were having a wife swap.'' Sometime in September 1978 the two were drinking at an abandoned quarry when they got into a fight and Bean died. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, with the help of his father, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, buried Bean's body. After Bean disappeared, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> divorced his wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, and married <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> settled in his five-room cabin on a dirt road three miles outside of <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> and he became the part-time police chief for the town of 600 three years ago. He also became the part-time chief of nearby <LOCATION> Gilsum </LOCATION> and a police trainee in <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>. He has a leave of absence from <LOCATION> Gilsum </LOCATION> and is suspended with pay from <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>. On March 11, police began digging in Chambers' front yard with a backhoe. Three days later, Bean's skeleton was found 20 feet deep. Pathologists determined Bean had been beaten on the head and chest. On March 2, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told his daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, and granddaughter, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> came to him in the middle of the night 10 years ago and said `` he had just killed <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and wanted to know what to do.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> said the two were drinking, got into a fight and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> hit Bean, who fell back, hit his head and died instantly. The father, in ill health, made <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> promise not to say anything until after his death. One week later, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 61, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died. That same day, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> told the story to the <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> police, who relayed the information to state police. Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the state police major crimes unit interviewed the women and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON>, the husband of <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> Authorities then sought a warrant to excavate the chief's yard. `` The relationship between <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> was weird,'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> said in her statement. `` It's called wife-swapping, that was going on before <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> ran off and <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> disappeared. I know <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> always beat <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>, that was why she ran off. -LRB- She -RRB- could n't take it any longer.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, who was admitted to a <LOCATION> Keene </LOCATION> hospital with an undisclosed illness after the digging began, left Chambers in July 1978. Bean was last seen in September 1978, and his wife moved in with Chambers that October. In January 1979, she divorced the missing Bean. Chambers divorced <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> in March and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> married in September 1979. Young's affidavit said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> wrote Bean's mother two letters about his disappearance. The first said Bean had borrowed money from <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who then gave Bean a ride to the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> state line and let him out. Later, she wrote that she feared <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, and that she was afraid <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> had harmed Bean. <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON> told police that after Bean disappeared, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told him he `` would not have to worry about seeing him -LRB- Bean -RRB- again. He -LRB- Chambers -RRB- hit him so hard no one would ever seen him again.'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, who lived with her father and <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> in a trailer behind <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' home, said her mother, now deceased, warned her to `` look out for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>.'' Last year, her father `` warned -LRB- me -RRB- about my brother being dangerous,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> led baby boomers and their swivel-hipped soul mates of all ages back to the 1950s Friday as 1,527 people simultaneously spun Hula Hoops at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> to claim a world record. The crowd _ certified by a turnstile count _ gyrated to the strains of `` Whole <PERSON> Lotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakin </PERSON>' Goin' On'' until a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> was satisfied he had witnessed history's biggest crowd of Hula Hoopers. But for most of the swirlers, making <PERSON> Hula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoop </PERSON> history took a back seat to having fun. `` I'm reliving my childhood,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Samagaio </PERSON>, 36, an investigator with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> district attorney's office. `` I was 7 years old when these came out,'' <PERSON> Samagaio </PERSON> said, demonstrating that <PERSON> Hula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooping </PERSON>, like riding a bike, is a skill one never loses entirely. Some hoopers woke up as early as 4 a.m. to reach the park from distant points of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They were all given T-shirts, free park admission and Hula Hoops. The record try was a promotion by <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoop </ORGANIZATION> maker <ORGANIZATION> Wham-O </ORGANIZATION>, which is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the toy this week. Some inept hoopers twirled the hoops on their wrists while others madly twisted while the hoops inexorably spun farther and farther down their legs. `` It's in the hips,'' confided <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, 11, of <PERSON> Penasquitos </PERSON>, who got a hoop for her birthday March 9 and already can twirl it for 10 minutes at a stretch. After three false starts, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wham-O </ORGANIZATION> employee who also serves as a <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> field representative, proclaimed success, which he had earlier defined as everyone putting his or her hoop through three revolutions at once. While Guinness does n't actually recognize a mass <PERSON> Hula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoop </PERSON> record at present, <PERSON> Roddick </PERSON> said the largest known mass swivel appears to have been performed by about 350 people some 25 years ago in the Northwest. That event is recorded only by a photograph, he said. For some of the teens and young adults in Friday's crowd, the event was sort of a ticket to more innocent times, symbolized for them by pompadour hair-dos and the do-wop music of the 1950s and early'60. `` It was happier,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Culver </PERSON>, 20, a college student from <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION> who favors 1950s music, dance and clothes. `` The styles, they fit better, they're more feminine,'' Miss <PERSON> Culver </PERSON> said. `` You can dance with the guys _ closer _ you do n't have to dance by yourself.

<HEAD>Governor Says Investigators Will Look Into Affidavits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Friday that investigators will look into claims that attorneys for death row inmates asked witnesses to lie to save the prisoners' lives. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who earlier this week ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> to check out the methods of the state-funded defenders, said he did n't plan to interfere. `` I probably wo n't make any more announcements now until the report comes in. It would n't be appropriate,'' he said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> also established an independent seven-member commission to review the investigation's findings to avoid any appearance that he was mounting a political attack against the Office of Capital Collateral Representative, a 3-year-old agency that has won stays of executions for dozens of inmates. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that allegedly false affidavits were given to <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> after witnesses _ two prison inmates, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> prosecutor and a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer _ complained about the conduct of several employees of the collateral appeals office. In each case, inmates who testified against men on death row say they were asked to sign false affidavits that would be used to gain a stay of execution. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Guralnick </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer who represented one of the inmates, said attorneys from the Office of Capital Collateral Representative in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> told him they had filed a motion alleging `` everything possible'' and would `` try to prove it later,'' the newspaper said. In both cases the affidavits, allegedly prepared by the death row lawyers, accused police who handled the murder investigations of inventing testimony that witnesses later repeated in court. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, the lawyer who supervises the collateral appeals office, said he has questioned the lawyers involved in one instance and will support them until he sees evidence to change his mind. `` The other one I know nothing about, but I will immediately talk to those involved,'' <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> blamed the investigation on the continuing controversy between his office and a governor who, he said, wants to speed up executions. <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>'s office was established in 1985 to handle appeals filed by death row inmates. Those appeals traditionally involve issues not concerning guilt of innocence, but legal procedures. The stae set up the appeals agency to provide lawyers for indigent inmates making their final appeal and do away with claims that inmates were not properly represented.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> portrayed his Democratic presidential opponents as too liberal on Friday, saying `` you do n't have to be very far to the right to be to the right of this crowd. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also said he was optimistic about his chances in Saturday's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses `` Wherever we have had a level playing field and enough time to get the message out and become known by the voters, we have won,'' he told a radio audience in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` The time in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> has been short ... but we've got a lot of good friends working for us and I hope that we'll do significantly better than people expect.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has steadfastly tried to depict himself as the moderate candidate in the presidential field.

Wearing a shiny white hardhat, blue jeans and a leisure shirt, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> took a 1 -LCB- - hour tour of the Racine Steel Casting plant The campaign stop gave <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> a chance to shovel chunks of metal into a furnace, to help a worker form a casting mold and to drive a forklift and unload large metal sprockets. `` I think getting some hands-on experience is a way to communicate symbolically with the workers,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told reporters he will continue to campaign heavily in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which will hold its primary April 5. `` I predict we're really going to surprise people in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has a chance to play a unique role.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also picked up the endorsement Friday of one-time presidential candidate <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who was a senator from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> when he sought the Democratic nomination in 1968, said he endorses <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> because of his experience and voting record on foreign affairs and economic and environmental issues. `` There is no better preparation for the presidency than being in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, especially the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` I've felt for some time that the governorship is the worst preparation for the presidency,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` It provides a great oversimplification of how the federal government operates.''

<HEAD>Baby M's Father Asks That Mother's Visitation Be Halted</HEAD>

 Allowing surrogate mother <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> to continue visiting Baby M will hurt the child psychologically, the toddler's father argued in court papers released Friday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who won custody of the baby in a landmark state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling Feb. 3, asked a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge to discontinue visitation. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s attorney said he will call expert witnesses to show that halting visitation would be in the best interest of the child, now legally known as <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` Testimony will again reconfirm ... that visitation at this particular point could only have a destabilizing influence on the child and result in very grave consequences on her future mental health,'' attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> said in court papers. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has asked that she be allowed to spend more time with the baby, with the meetings expanded eventually to half the summer and some holidays. She has been allowed to see <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> once a week, for two hours, under supervision. Court papers released Thursday by Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s attorneys call that schedule `` insufficient.'' She contends that the child would be harmed if those visitations were discontinued. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> has fashioned an excellent relationship with <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing and productive relationship,'' said court papers filed by Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>. The documents, filed earlier this week, give an indication what both sides will argue when <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Birger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sween </PERSON> on Monday convenes a visitation hearing that may be the final legal skirmish in the fierce battle over the child, who turns 2 Sunday. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>'s $ 10,000 contract with <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> became a highly publicized court case after she refused to turn over the child she agreed to bear. Since the case began, Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> divorced her first husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, and married a Wall Street broker, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be `` totally opposed'' to any Israeli attack on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s new intermediate-range missile launchers. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, meanwhile, confirmed that the administration has cautioned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not take action against the newly delivered Chinese missiles. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> refused to comment on reports that the Israeli air force has been conducting low-level practice bombing runs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would feel about Israeli attacks on the Saudi sites, said, `` Naturally, we would be totally opposed to any such thing and hope that they are not considering any such act.'' Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Thursday that he had sent an urgent message to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urging him to `` use his influence with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and urge it to stop threatening <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in this irresponsible way.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said such an attack would `` blow up the entire peace process'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about the situation as he prepared to meet with visiting President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, an unidentified Egyptian official said <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> would consider any Israeli attack on the installations an attack on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> itself. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> recently acquired the missiles, which have a range of 2,200 miles, enough to reach <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have given assurances they will be fitted only with conventional warheads. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, a senior aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a tradition of not standing by quietly when there is a real threat against it. The question is if this is a threat or not. There are people to deal with it, the Cabinet, the government.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> issued a warning through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it would use any remaining missiles to strike at the Jewish state if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> attempted a pre-emptive strike. <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had `` told us they are going to deal with the matter the best they can, both in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was `` concerned about any instability that is introduced by weapons changes in the area'' and had made its views known to both the Israelis and the Saudis. He added that `` our protests have gone to the nuclear capability as opposed to the site.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded Friday it was a `` foregone conclusion'' that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would win the Republican presidential nomination, while long-shots <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> looked to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrats to resuscitate their fading campaigns. `` I can read the numbers and I probably know what's happening,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> audience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> indicated he was re-evaluating his campaign and would likely `` have something to say'' before the April 5 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. The campaigns of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, winners of the lead-off <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses in their respective parties, stood at turning points on Friday. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> stayed in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, insisting that `` we're going to turn this race around'' _ although his aides were saying privately that the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman would call it quits if he lost <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Saturday caucuses. An aura of political fatalism hovered over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s hard-luck drive for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as he said of the successor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` If it ca n't be me, it will be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has garnered 788 delegates to the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next August, more than two-thirds the number necessary to win the nomination. Propelled by his sweep in the Super Tuesday competition of March 8, the vice president has amassed 727 of those delegates in the last 30 days, while <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has won none. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator has 178 delegates, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 17. The vice president, who learned about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s comments shortly after giving a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This does n't say it's over. So I'm going to just keep going right down to the wire and not speculate on somebody else's campaign or on the Democratic side.'' Asked whether he would consider <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It's too early for me to start thinking about any running mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I do n't want to do.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, in his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I've been saying now for some time as a candidate all the things I thought we should focus on, and nobody really seems to care. `` I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the Republican side,'' he said. `` But I still have some things to say. Lo and behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find more people willing to listen.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, shrugged off questions about his role in the Iran-Contra affair. `` The Democrats are short of real issues,'' he said, `` bringing it up over and over again. No one is even suggesting I have done anything wrong.'' Most of the Democrats were in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, scouring the heavily industrialized state for votes in Saturday's caucuses, with 138 delegates at stake. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had been described by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s aides earlier as a do-or-die campaign battlefield. On Friday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> mimicked rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim of an economic miracle in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, saying he looked forward to a `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> miracle'' to revive his candidacy. `` We're going to get back in the middle of this thing,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leading in opinion polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, but he warned his supporters not to take anything for granted. `` Friends, you're looking at a guy who was 50 points ahead in the polls in 1978 when I first ran for re-election ... and I lost,'' he said The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, a longtime opponent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, said he would support aid to the rebels to support the new ceasefire and the regional peace plan of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> _ `` providing it is channeled through international relief agencies, neutral agencies and not the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the agencies of the federal government.'' During an airport news conference, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was asked about the possibility that he would win no delegates in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` I recognize that's a possibility but it's not fatal to my campaign,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sought to set himself apart from the rest of the Democratic field, saying his more moderate stands are `` not conservative. I've never used that word. Let me hasten to add, you do n't have to be very far to the right to be to the right of this crowd.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for vetoing legislation extending a civil rights law _ a veto supported by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but overridden by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and called it `` an attempt to turn back the clock.'' `` Any man who stands ... against civil rights restoration in this country is not fit to lead our nation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are running one-two in the Democratic delegate race, according to The Associated Press tabulation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 548 of the 2,082 delegates needed for nomination, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 520. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 362 delegates, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 171 and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 154.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will meet Saturday with two members of the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as Americans are being warned to keep away from the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Professor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of the two <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members invited by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said they notified <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and he approved of the session. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, <PERSON> Said </PERSON> said he and Professor <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> did not need a ` ` green light'' from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to see <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` We did notify Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and that was fine with him _ absolutely,'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting did not represent a change in the 13-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have condemned it as a terrorist organization. In another action Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a travel advisory against the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Americans were cautioned not to travel to the areas. The announcement coincided with the approach of Easter and Passover, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Jewish holidays that usually attract tourists to the Holy Land. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> said he and Abu-Lughud were interested in `` an exchange of views'' with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. He said they wanted to know more about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. `` I am not a diplomat,'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> said. `` We're going to tell him about the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' view of the whole matter.'' Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should participate in the negotiations, the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> professor replied without hesitation: `` Absolutely.'' He said he did not know if the meeting changed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have no idea. I ` m not too concerned about this,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement Friday described <PERSON> Said </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON> as `` prominent Americans with an intimate knowledge of contemporary Middle Eastern politics.'' Their membership on the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was not mentioned in the announcement but was confirmed later by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> protested <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s invitation to the two as in conflict with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is pledged to dismantling <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meantime, cited `` continuing disturbances'' in urging Americans to stay away from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. A total of 111 Palestinian Arabs and an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> soldier have died in violent protests and other incidents since Dec. 9. `` We are not issuing an advisory for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is safe for American travel.'' However, with the statement coming during the Easter season, which attracts many religious pilgrims to the area, the impact on tourism and on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s economy could be severe. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was held by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from 1949 until 1967 when the Arabs lost the territories to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the Six-Day War. About 96 percent of the population is <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>. The travel advisory cautioned Americans to avoid travel to the areas `` until further notice.'' It said Americans living in the areas `` should exercise particular caution.'' The situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which is part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capital, was described as `` unpredictable. The advisory said Americans should check with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in the city before entering the area. `` Under all circumstances, Americans should avoid demonstrations and other situations that have the potential to lead to violence,'' the advisory said. `` American travelers should carry their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports at all times.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will hold the meeting with Said and <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON> `` to discuss our approach to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process,'' the separate announcement said. He is trying to open negotiations on May 1 to provide self-rule for the Palestinians. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would not participate. However, Palestinians with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> approval would be part of a delegation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> stressed that Said and Abu-Lughud are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. She said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> itself remained intact. `` There is no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on negotiating with or recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` That policy remains as it has been since 1975.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, after persuading <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to relinquish territory to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, promised in 1975 it would not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The pledge subsequently was incorporated in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had given Said and <PERSON> Abu-Lughud </PERSON> permission to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` I have nothing on that.'' She said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> initiated the meeting. `` He will discuss the Palestinian point of view,'' she said. `` They have an intimate knowledge of Middle Eastern politics.'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador, telephoned <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an assistant to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, to protest the meeting as a violation of the pledge. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> declined to describe the conversation.

Reps. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, also wrote the secretary of their concern that the meeting `` might be seen as an erosion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position regarding the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> lauded the meeting as `` a reflection of the reality that legitimate Palestinian representation is essential to any peace in the region.''

Apparently under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders, none of them showed up. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> went to a hotel in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, stood in the floodlit courtyard and read a statement suggesting the Palestinians were fearful of working with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Opportunity knocks loudly on your door,'' he said then. `` Now is the time to get to work. We have a workable plan, and we are ready to commit our efforts to it. The time is right, together, to make decisions of historic proportions.''

<HEAD>Riot Police With Water Cannon Break Up Religious Freedom Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot police used water cannon Friday to break up a Roman Catholic demonstration for religious freedom held in downtown <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> in defiance of an official ban, Western observers said. Clashes broke out when police tried to clear the square of thousands of Catholics who gathered in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Injuries and arrests were reported, but no figures were available. <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> is a southern city near the Czechoslovak-Austrian border. Witnesses said it took security troops and riot police about 45 minutes to push the Catholics, who were singing, praying and holding candles, into side streets to end the protest. Two television teams, sent to <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> from the Austrian state radio-television corporation, <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION>, and the West German ARD station, were seen being shoved by police and detained as <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> gathered on the square. They were prevented from filming the protest. <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklosko </PERSON>, a Slovak Catholic activist, had told authorities of plans for a peaceful rally and organizers were expecting up to 70,000 people would take part. But communist authorities Thurday banned the demonstration, saying it was `` an event guided from abroad'' and directed against the socialist system. Protesters defied the ban, saying they wanted a free and independent church and 10 bishops appointed to fill vacant bishoprics throughout <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Government officials have been arguing with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> over the vacancies. Organizers also wanted to show support for a petition calling for separation of church and state and for free expression of religion, which has been signed so far by more than 430,000 Czechoslovak Catholics. The Austrian TV crew was released after 2 -LCB- hours, <ORGANIZATION> ORF </ORGANIZATION> journalist <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoermann </PERSON> reported. In a broadcast telephone call from his car driving toward the nearby border, <PERSON> Hoermann </PERSON> said he and his colleagues saw about 100 Catholics who were taken to police headquarters. `` They were totally drenched,'' he said, referring to police use of road-cleaning trucks and water cannon. `` It has also been raining. So <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> must be today the cleanest city in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hoermann </PERSON> said he saw many police with clubs around <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> as he drove from the city. Demonstrators began gathering at 3.30 p.m.. A witness said shortly before 6 p.m., when the crowd was several thousand strong, people clutching candles sang the Slovak and Czech national anthems Police began moving street-cleaning trucks and police cars toward the square. Authorities used loudspeakers to urged demonstrators to vacate the square, saying: `` This demonstration has not been allowed according to state laws. Will you please disperse?'' But the appeal went unheeded. Police cars, six abreast, drove through the crowd. The scene became chaotic as demonstrators blocked off some of the cars. Elderly women, middle-aged people and youngsters were among those resisting. Then came the street-cleaning trucks, spewing water. Most of the demonstrators stood fast on the square. Authorities brought in riot police and three water cannon drenched the crowd. The demonstrators still were not entirely dispersed, and security troops shoved people off the square, herding them into side streets. Students were warned this week not to take part in the protest and threatened with losing their place at universities and dormitories, the Austrian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Kathpress </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Kathpress </ORGANIZATION> said the organizers insisted the event was registered officially as a `` peaceful assembly of citizens.'' They were also quoted as saying, `` Is it unlawful to stage a rally for religious freedom, observance of human rights and appointment of bishops by the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>?'' The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> later said members of illegal church structures tried to organize a `` quiet religious demonstration,'' the aim of which was to abuse religious feelings of believers, violate relations between the socialist state and the church, and undermine negotiations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A strong earthquake shook a sparsely populated area of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> on Friday. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The quake registered 6.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered about 95 miles west of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simpson </LOCATION>, 750 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetmiller </PERSON>, a federal seismologist. An earthquake of that magnitude can do serious damage, but <PERSON> Wetmiller </PERSON> said it was too far from populated areas to pose a danger. It struck 12:36 p.m. MST and was felt in communities several hundred miles away, he said. The last earthquakes of that magnitude in the region were in 1985. One of 6.6 was reported Oct. 5 and another of 6.9 on Dec. 23 that year. The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated area; a magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude 7 widespread, heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake, a `` great'' earthquake capable of tremendous damage. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denounced President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday for opposing civil rights legislation and accused presidential rivals in both parties of `` not offering leadership to stop the flow of drugs.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, striving for a win in a big industrial state, campaigned at the county jail, inner-city union halls and a suburban high school, blending his criticism of Republicans with stirring calls to shun the `` short-term thrill, long-term chill'' of drugs. On the eve of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s statewide Democratic presidential caucuses, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> provided his own answer to those who ask what he seeks to accomplish with a candidacy that is dogged by the assumption he can not win the nomination, even as he leads the Democratic field in popular votes cast. `` People always ask, no matter how we're winning, what does <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> want,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said before a crowd of more than 1,000 people, jammed into the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 212 next door to a shut-down Chrysler plant. `` What does <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> want? I want to wipe out illiteracy,'' he said. `` What do I want? I want to raise the minimum wage. What do I want? I want comparable worth for women. ... `` I want head start and day care early on, rather than jail-fare and welfare later on,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of legislation extending a civil rights law, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for that veto, `` an attempt to turn back the clock.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday overrode <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the bill, which covers discrimination by institutions that use federal money. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued that the legislation would expand federal power. `` Any man who stands ... against civil rights restoration in this country is not fit to lead our nation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Linking drugs to problems of inner cities such as the one where he was campaigning, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly and noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position as head of the administration's fight against drugs. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... he's over the drug commission, and offers no leadership,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> hall. `` Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, my competitors, are not offering leadership to stop the flow of drugs,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Later in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> named rivals <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and said he was outspent 50-to-1 by them in the South `` yet we got the most votes.'' `` If they had my budget, they would surrender. If I had their budget, they could not compete,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke at a Baptist church where the crowd was so large people stood outside unable to get in. He also spoke in the parking lot beside a UAW hall where Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spoke a day earlier. Across the street was a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> auto assembly plant closed three months ago, laying off some 3,500 workers. `` Foreign labor is not better labor, it's just cheaper labor,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> did n't take jobs from us, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> took jobs to them.'' At each stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave careful instructions on how to vote in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s unusual caucus system. At one rally he called all the young children in the crowd to gather around him. `` Who are you going to vote for?'' he asked them. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' they responded. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was running in a tight <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> race with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, according to most polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> running third in a state where he must win. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the black civil rights activist, is counting on doing well in heavily black <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, even though the city's black mayor, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, is backing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> would be a major achievement for his candidacy in a state of the industrial North _ one where only 16 years ago <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> won a stunning Democratic primary victory. He spoke in a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> neighborhood not far from empty factories, vacant lots and gutted storefronts. `` What does it matter to have civil rights, if you can march downtown but ca n't walk down your own neighborhood streets?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked. Hours earlier, he visited the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail and met with about 30 inmates, all facing misdemeanor charges, and urged them to use their time to read and learn and to reject drugs. `` Just because you're down, you do n't have to be out; you can change your situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged the inmates to ask for absentee ballots and vote in the presidential balloting being conducted at Saturday's caucuses

 A doctor said Friday he was looking out his office window when he saw his house passing before his eyes. It was on a flatbed truck, headed out of town with a police escort. `` I ran down the street and yelled, ` Hey, where are you going with my house?''' Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON>, a general practitioner and part owner of a real estate business, said in relating Thursday's events `` The cop looked at me like I was crazy,'' said <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON>, 55. `` This is your house, mister?'' the officer asked. `` This is a house-napping,'' <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON> told him. The officer stopped the convoy and walked to the back to talk to the man who had ordered the house moved. He was gone. `` We all stood in the street laughing,'' said <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON>. `` It seemed so ridiculous. Who would steal a house?'' The answer, provided by the boss of the flatbed truck, was a guy who sold it to someone else for $ 500, then hired the mover to deliver it. `` The concept of a man's home being his castle has been shaken to its very foundation,'' <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. The two-bedroom yellow beach house with a white door had been placed on runners for removal because <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON> had sold it _ a $ 12,000 value _ earlier in the week.

 Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, while serving in the German army, received and then forwarded <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s order to kill captured <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> partisans, according to documents released Friday. The documents from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Achives are <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s army group's war diary and a corresponding Nuremberg War Trial document. They were provided by the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The chief witness against <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> is the one he can never refute _ his own name on the captured <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war records,'' said <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, confirmed Friday that the war diary and <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> records were among documents used in deciding to place <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on the `` watchlist'' that bars undesirable aliens from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Austrian government has protested that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has not disclosed the documents. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general from 1972 to 1982, has denied committing any war crimes, although his army unit was accused of them. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> served with the German army during World War II in the occupied <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. He was a lieutenant in the German General Staff attached to the 11th Italian Army in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The documents show that on Aug. 8, 1943, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> entered <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s order to kill captured Greek partisans in his army group's war diary in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and on the same day transmitted the order by radio to a German division in the field The diary entry signed by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said: `` According to a new Fuehrer order bandits -LRB- partisans -RRB- captured in battle are to be shot. Others suspected of banditry, etc., are to be taken prisoner and sent to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for use in labor details.'' The translation was provided by the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The word `` bandit'' was used to describe partisans. The Nuremberg document shows the actual transmission of the order: `` To the 1st Mountain Division: Reference Teletype Ia No. 959-43 Secret of 7 Aug. 1943 concerning shooting of bandits. A new Fuehrer order is at hand, which will be transmitted. Bandits taken in battle are to be shot. Other bandit suspects etc. are to be arrested and evacuated for ` <PERSON> Sauckel </PERSON>' labor service.'' SS Gen. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauckel </PERSON>, sentenced to death at <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>, ran a network of slave labor camps. The 1st Mountain Division was operating against the anti-Nazi resistance in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the documents were made available at this time because <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, despite his protests, has failed to appeal the `` watchlist'' decision. `` These documents demonstrate the basis for that decision and the evidence is devastating,'' he said. An Austrian `` white book'' rebutting charges against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> makes brief reference to the war diary but does not mention his role in forwarding the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> order and does not mention the <ORGANIZATION> Nuremberg </ORGANIZATION> document. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said that in the `` white book'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` ignores half the diary entry which says these instructions on treatment of bandits are being transmitted.'' The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> located the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> war diary and <ORGANIZATION> Nuremberg </ORGANIZATION> document at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and turned them over to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A commission of historians appointed by the Austrian government issued a report earlier this year saying <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was in a position to know of atrocities but did not try to stop them.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree To Allow US Psychiatrists To Visit Soviet Mental
Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet officials agreed in principle during a human rights conference that ended Friday to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> psychiatrists to visit Soviet mental hospitals, a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. That could lead to examination by Americans of Soviets believed to be incarcerated in mental institutions solely because they are dissidents. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for human rights, said the agreement was reached during a unique `` roundtable discussion'' between Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> psychiatrists and legal experts. The purpose of the conference, from the American side, was to press the Soviets to put into practice recent pledges to improve human rights, to allow judicial review of government actions affecting human rights and to explore ways the Soviets could moderate policies on capital punishment, control of religious activity and use of mental hospitals. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where commitment is a legal process, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> permits incarceration in a mental hospital if two psychiatrists sign the order. For years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Soviet activists and psychiatrists around the world have accused the Russians of using the system to lock up dissidents who are perfectly sane. The practice has reportedly been stopped in new cases, but <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said: `` there are certain persons whose names have come up _ still in psychiatric institutions _ who in the opinion of a great many people may be there for reasons other than their mental health.'' Under the agreement at the conference, in addition to visiting the Soviet institutions, there may be requests for visiting psychiatrists to examine specific patients, <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said. `` I consider that a possibility.'' Soviet psychiatrists will also visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mental institutions. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would not be involved in the exchanges, but would leave all arrangements to private psychiatric groups. At the conference, <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said, the Soviets also were willing to discuss the issue of capital punishment. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> performs 10 times as many executions as are carried out in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year and that there have been some indications <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is examining whether to continue applying the death penalty for major economic crimes. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participants also suggested the Soviets consider dropping use of capital punishment in national security cases. The last spies executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, who were convicted in the early 1950s of giving atomic bomb secrets to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Among the participants in the roundtable _ the first conference of its type under a 1975 agreement to hold them _ were <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peele </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The Soviet delegates included <PERSON> Anatoliy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>, the deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Vasiliy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasikhin </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> USA-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gennadily </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milekhin </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Serbskiy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Soviet hospital. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamenar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said the chief accomplishment of the conference was `` the recognition by the Soviets that they have shortcomings; that they have problems.'' He said the Soviets agreed to hold several workshops on human rights and appeared to be eager to talk about the rights situation. `` Talk is cheap, but this is a beginning and we'll see where it goes,'' <PERSON> Kamenar </PERSON> said.

In a dispatch, the Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> noted that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he welcomed the agreement between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the rebels, but that he also added there `` is reason to have caution'' because of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' past actions. `` It would not be surprising if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would now exert pressure on the Contra leaders to abhor the agreement with <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and force them to retake the path of war,'' <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said in its dispatch, received Friday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drawing up a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan that calls for cease-fires in the region's wars, said Thursady he believes the Nicaraguan agreement can succeed. `` I want to be optimistic and trust the good faith of those who signed the document,'' he said. The agreement was signed Wednesday in the Nicaraguan border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, near the Costa Rican border. `` If an effective cease-fire is achieved for 60 days and can be extended there is no reason whatsoever not to advance in fulfilling the other points'' in the peace plan, he said. The peace plan, signed by the five Central American presidents last Aug. 7 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, also calls for democratic reforms, amnesties and an end to outside aid to insurgencies. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the region's conflicts also must be dealt with by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` who will have to do their share so that they get their hands out of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> are to hold two days of talks in <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>. High on their agenda is the Nicaraguan pact and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to force Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of office. `` We observe with worry how in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> military threats and foreign interference are taking on a new impulse ... along with economic aggression and military intimidation,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> said in his welcoming speech. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, said, `` We are ready to do everything possible so that the nations of the world learn to respect us and to help other peoples of the world become masters of their own destinities.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sent 3,200 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last week at the request of Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, who accused Nicaraguan troops of crossing the border into his country to attack base camps of the U.S.-backed Contras. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> denied its troops had entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Honduran officials said earlier this week the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had withdrawn. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> made no mention of the Nicaraguan cease-fire agreement in their remarks at <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not justified in sending troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and there was no reason for them to remain there any longer. He also said he had discussed with <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> the possibility of another meeting of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents. `` There is much to talk about and clarify,'' he said, but did not elaborate.

 The 3,200-man <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> expeditionary force that flew here last week during a Honduran-Nicaraguan border crisis will start returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday, military intelligence sources said. The sources said the first troops of the 82nd Airborne Division, based at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, will return Monday and the entire force will be back home within two or three days after. There was no immediate confirmation from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesmen here. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The Americans were deployed here from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a dramatic show of force after President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> asked for help, charging that Nicarguan forces had penetrated Honduran territory while chasing U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Honduran government officials said tensions had subsided along the border and that the Sandinista troops had withdrawn. `` It's peaceful on the border,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Lisandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> said. `` There are no Sandinista troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has reported several smaller incursions since the arrival of paratroopers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> and light infantry from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on March 17-18. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces continued joint training exercises Friday with Honduran troops at four bases throughout the country, Cap. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLoche </PERSON>, a public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> Air Base said. <PERSON> DeLoche </PERSON> said the soldiers expected to go home next week, but were still awaiting orders. DeLoche spoke by telephone from the base, about 40 milies northwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. Deployment of the reinforcements brought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strength in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to more than 6,000, alarming even the friendly governments in the region. The Sandinistas accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of either preparing to invade <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or using the training exercises to cover up the delivery of arms and equipment for the Contras, whose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid was cut off by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month. Some congresmen voiced similar suspicions about the equipment brought here with the troops, including combat helicopters and large quantities of weapons. Auditors from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' watchdog, were to come to <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> to make sure the equipment went home with the troops. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said the auditors were coming at the request of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers. Neither he nor DeLoche could say when the auditors were due in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Since the troops' arrival, there have been major developments in the six-year war between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government the rebels. The two sides agreed Wednesday to a 60-day cease-fire as a prelude to talks on permanent peace. Meanwhile, Honduran military air reconnaissance Thursday of the frontier in <LOCATION> Olancho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> provinces detected no Sandinista activity in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. The ministry had filed what it called an `` energetic protest'' with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Thursday over what it said were two border incursions involving a total of about 350 Sandinistas this week. No confrontations were reported. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, a meeting of representatives of the five Central American nations who signed a regional peace accord on Aug. 7, 1987, apparently broke down over the issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> demanded withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> countered by demanding that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> withdraw a complaint filed with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The complaint accuses <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> of harboring Contras.

 Torrential rains swept across central <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> Friday and civil defense officials reported six storm-related deaths. They said flooding forced the evacuation of about 20,000 people. Two women were electrocuted by downed power lines as they tried to cross streets in suburban <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, according to the officials.

<HEAD>Bar Becomes Symbol for `Preppie' Lifestyle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On Aug. 25, 1986, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> was just another <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> bar catering to the young and upwardly mobile: a hangout for yuppies and preppies, where the Izod crowd came to knock back a few. Twenty-four hours later, all that changed. With the death of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> early on the morning of Aug. 26, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s became _ fairly or unfairly _ a symbol of youthful decadence, of teen-agers with too much money and no place to go. Among them was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who sat at the bar drinking shots of tequila with beer chasers the night he killed Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. `` He fouled everybody's life up,'' bar owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> `` Jack'' <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> said recently. `` Who needs this guy?'' After Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death, investigators returned to <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s and closed the bar for 10 days for serving underage patrons in November 1986 <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> has put the bar up for sale; no buyer has been found. Chambers, now 21, had been a regular at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s. He also was a college dropout who had a very proper upbringing. Dinner at the Chambers house, located next to the former <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> mansion a few blocks north of <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s, `` always had silver involved,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Destino </PERSON>, a friend of Chambers, shortly after his arrest. Chambers apparently had no steady job at the time of his arrest, yet was drinking and flirting `` five or six nights a week'' at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s, said its owner. Interviews in the months since the slaying indicate <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s remains attractive, a place where young people can gather in front of an ornate fireplace and play backgammon at the tables Regulars said they avoided <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s after Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> died, fearing the bar had been taken over by the curious. But the young men and women who grew up in the wealthy neighborhood and knew one another in the best prep schools came back. Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> was not a regular at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s but was known there. Patrons do n't talk much about the case, they said. `` I come here when I feel like sitting around like I'm in my living room,'' said <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Donati </PERSON>, 21, who said she has been frequenting <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s for five years. <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> himself knows who's who in the bar; he can point out the child of a well-known writer and the daughter of a presidential adviser. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of ex-Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, was tending bar the night of the death. Chambers would no longer be welcome, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> said. Other regulars would say tourists, out-of-towners and the curious are not welcome either. `` Parents like their kids to come here,'' Miss <PERSON> Donati </PERSON> said 17 months after Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death. `` Here they know the people are from at least good families, they've been to good colleges, and they're not out to rape people.''

 An attempt by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adventurers to circle the Earth in a balloon in 9 to 14 days was scuttled Friday by bad weather, officials said. The attempt by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrehn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, to launch their 360-foot-high balloon from <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> was canceled by heavy rains, and poor weather forecast this weekend jeopardizes the entire project, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosker </PERSON>. Torrential rains lashed central <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Andes for the second day and officials on Friday blamed the storms for six deaths. Weather forecasters said the rain would continue through Sunday. Ms. <PERSON> Rosker </PERSON> said of the balloonists, `` The last word I have is that they're planning to launch on Tuesday. That will be the final day. After that, the project will have to be canceled, which would be a pity because of all the effort they've put into this.'' The balloonists are trying to do what no one else has: Circle the Earth around the 45-degree parallel in the Southern Hemisphere using longitudinal winds that carry them to the east, Ms. <PERSON> Rosker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Petrehn </PERSON>, head of the project, is a 52-year-old businessman from <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 50, is a former Vietnam War pilot and a Kansas-based pilot for <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. They chose <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, 660 miles west of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> as their launch and landing site because `` apparently it was the part of the world where there are more days of sun and good weather and because it had good wind conditions,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosker </PERSON> said. The balloonists have received about $ 2.5 million in donations for the project, which includes scientific experiments measuring ozone levels along the 45th parallel, she said. They plan to ride in a specially devised gondola. It contains a small porthole for a window, a bed and one chair. They plan to maintain contact along the route with radar and sophisticated radio equipment, she said. `` It has a small window like a mini-sub and is quite uncomfortable. Also very dangerous because practically all the time they will be flying over water with no help. If a storm arises and it's not predicted by satellite, they will be in trouble,'' she said. Two balloons, one of hot air and the other of helium, will ride piggyback above the gondola, allowing the craft to rise and fall by opening valves of hot air as it travels east with the prevailing winds, Ms. <PERSON> Rosker </PERSON> said. `` They can reach an altitude of 30,000 feet. The gondola is pressurized for their comfort and they will use the same type of food as astronauts, dehydrated food and lots of water,'' she said. According to <PERSON> Petrehn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and members of the crew of 24 that helped bring the balloons and gondola to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the flight would be the first non-stop, unrefueled, manned balloon trip around the world. The craft's intended flight from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plumerillo </LOCATION> air base outside <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> would take it over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, about 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, over the southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> where it would cross the Andes and arrive back in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> after 17,545 miles. <PERSON> Petrehn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the longest manned balloon flight was that of the Double Eagle V, which in 1981 crossed the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and covered about 5,000 miles.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter Friday for strangling a young woman during sex in Central Park, halting jury deliberations in the `` preppie murder'' case after nine days. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> asked Chambers whether he intended to cause `` serious injury'' to 18-year-old <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> `` and thereby cause her death.'' State law defines first-degree manslaughter as causing a death while intending to cause serious injury. `` Looking back on everything, I have to say yes,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 21, said. `` It breaks my heart to have to say that.'' At that, prosecutor <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> shot up and said loudly, `` We're asking about his mind and his hands, not his heart.'' The judge repeated the question, and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> replied, `` Yes.'' Chambers' mother, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, stared straight ahead, showing no emotion. His father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, also sat silently. Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death in the summer of 1986 focused attention on the lives of wealthy young New Yorkers. It also drew protests from feminists, who argued that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' defense was an example of blaming women for male violence. Chambers had maintained that he never intended to hurt Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, whom he had dated before, and killed her accidentally with a swipe of his arm when she hurt him during rough sex. The sexual encounter was not their first. Chambers originally was charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. Under a plea bargain, he will be sentenced to five to 15 years. He could have received up to eight and one-third to 25 years on the charge. Sentencing was set for April 15. The plea bargain, reached after two days of negotiations, came as the jury was in its ninth day of deliberations. Chambers' trial began with jury selection Oct. 21. Opening arguments started Jan. 4. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said that the prospect of a possible mistrial, the strain on the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family and the circumstantial nature of the evidence prompted the plea bargain. `` I'll feel better tomorrow when he's in jail, where he should be,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s mother. `` He was n't the lily-white altar boy he appeared to be.'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, who was free on $ 157,500 bail during the trial, will surrender Saturday morning, said his attorney, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Litman </PERSON>. Chambers also pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary in an unrelated indictment, with his sentence to run concurrent with his manslaughter sentence. One juror said the votes on the murder charge swung from 8-4 for acquittal to 9-3 for conviction, and the last vote was 7-5 for acquittal. But he said he felt the jury could have reached a verdict. The judge had sealed the jurors' names, and the juror who spoke would identify himself only as <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>. When lawyers involved in the burglary case appeared earlier in the day, prompting speculation about a plea bargain, Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s grandfather <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenitz </PERSON>, 72, said he found such talk `` sickening. `` If that was n't so tragic, it would be funny,'' he said. Shortly after Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s body was found, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> told police in a videotaped statement that she had `` molested'' him sexually and hurt his genitals. For four hours during his closing argument, <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> appealed to the jury to acquit <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>. `` What he was doing was reacting to the pain,'' <PERSON> Litman </PERSON> said. `` He was trying to stop her'' and the result was a `` tragic accident.'' <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> called the story `` ludicrous.'' She said he attacked Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> in a rage, punched her, chased her when she tried to flee, caught her and `` squeezed the life out of her.'' <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON>, holding a photo of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> taken in a bar hours before her death, told the jury: `` One ca n't help but look at that photograph and pray for time to stand still, for time to grab her and say, ` Do n't go with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>.''' The judge told the jury that while `` motive is not an element of the crime charged here,'' the lack of one is a circumstance from which they might infer innocence. <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> had been hard put to offer a motive, and suggested Chambers strangled Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> after an argument which started when he was impotent after a night of drinking. `` Perhaps he could n't perform because he had too many beers and shots of tequila that night,'' she said. At 11:30 p.m. Aug. 25, 1986, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> arrived at <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s Red Hand. The bar-restaurant on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, in the heart of one of the city's wealthiest areas, was popular among privileged young people, many of them younger than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s legal drinking age of 21. The atmosphere, bartender <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zacarro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified, was festive. Patrons on their way to colleges table-hopped, embraced friends and laughed. That night Chambers, a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> dropout, talked with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who was planning to go to college that fall. They left together. The prosecution presented 25 witnesses and 120 exhibits, including many color photos of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s bruised and nearly nude body beneath a tree behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art where she was found by a bicyclist at daybreak. The prosecutor argued the victim's left eye, red and swollen, and the fracture in a small bone in Chambers' hand show that the defendant assaulted her with `` hands as deadly as any arsenal.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government began using newspaper ads Friday to drum up information about Nazi war criminals, apparently in reponse to charges it has not been energetic in pursuing perpetrators of World War II atrocities. `` War Criminals _ Evidence Wanted,'' read the heading of the ad that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> and other papers with national circulations. The advertisements were taken out by a special war crimes inquiry panel set up after the Nazi-hunting <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> accused the British government of failing to seek and prosecute war criminals. `` It is alleged that some war criminals responsible for genocide, murder or manslaughter in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or German-occupied territories during the Second World War are in the -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the ad says. `` Others with British nationality may be living elsewhere in the world. The names of some suspects have already been sent to the Home Office.'' The advertisements say that when the inquiry is complete, Home Minister <PERSON> Douhlas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> will advise the government `` whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the prosecution of the alleged offenders.'' They ask anyone with `` any information that you think may be relevant'' to write the Home Office. The ads are to be repeated in newspapers Sunday. The inquiry panel is headed by the former director of public prosecutions, Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetherington </PERSON>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a former senior government official in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hetherington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> will spend a year investigating evidence and interviewing people with information in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> office, last month gave British officials the names of two more alleged war criminals and more evidence against nine suspects the government already confirmed are living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON> said at that time that the center expects dozens of suspected war criminals living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western countries to stand trial within 18 months as new legal changes close in on the suspects. He said in an interview in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last month that, before <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> set up the inquiry, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was the only major Western country that refused to take any action against alleged war criminals. The Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> center has submitted the names of a total of 256 suspects to eight countries _ <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ where they are alleged to have fled after the war ended in 1945. The suspects are mainly from the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, all now part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They are accused of collaborating with Nazi invaders in killing Jews and others. British-resident suspects include a former Lithuanian platoon commander, 71-year-old <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gecas </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The Wiesenthal center alleges Gecas killed more Jews than <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, the so-called Butcher of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gecas </ORGANIZATION>, a retired mining engineer, says he is innocent and the accusations have wrecked his life. The Wiesenthal center tracked down the suspects, mostly over age 70, after gaining access to international immigration data in late 1986. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are probing cases identified by the center, while <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> set up inquiry commissions and changed their laws recently to allow prosecutions. <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON> charged last month that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> have done little or nothing to trace the individuals or prosecute.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, fighting charges he misused $ 80,000 from a `` protocol fund'' by loaning it to his auto dealership, testified Friday he was told he could use the money for practically `` any damn thing that you want.'' The first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said he had never heard the money referred to as public funds. Testimony at the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial in recent days has focused on his borrowing at 9 percent interest money that had been raised by his inaugural ball. State law had barred him from using the money to pay off campaign debts, and a `` protocol fund'' was set up instead last year. Witnesses said the fund was intended to promote <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> through events and gifts to visiting dignitaries. The prosecution contends the fund was public money; the defense contends that it was private and that it was borrowed because <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s dealership was in desperate financial straits. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he received instructions on use of the money from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s inaugural committee, which had raised the funds before learning they could not be used to retire campaign debts. `` Mr. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said, ` We have gone through all of this rigamarole and you can spend it for any damn thing that you want,' those were his words, ` except you ca n't spend it for politics or personal living expenses,''' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> testified. `` I never heard the words discussed, ` public funds,''' the 63-year-old governor said under questioning by his attorney, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. A key piece of evidence in the case is a letter of agreement signed by <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney agreeing that money placed in the fund could be used only to promote the interests of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and encourage public service. However, Long, in an affidavit submitted by the defense Friday, said he `` did not intend to transfer these monies as a gift to the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' The misuse of funds charge is the second of three impeachment counts before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier heard testimony on an allegation <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> attempted to obstruct an investigation of an alleged death threat. The governor has also been accused of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, also faces a recall election May 17 and a criminal trial April 21 on charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who took the stand shortly before the trial recessed for the weekend, began answering allegations that his <ORGANIZATION> Mecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> dealership was in financial trouble and needed the $ 80,000 borrowed in July. He and his attorney presented documents that they said showed the company had an unencumbered net value of $ 2.5 million at the time. A prosecution accountant had testified the company owed more than it was worth. Asked about a $ 101,900 loan that was in default last summer, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said that was a mistake. `` Quite frankly, I was n't watching my details,'' he said. `` I was a little red faced when they caught up with me and I took care of it.'' In testimony earlier Friday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s son denied the family car business was in financial distress when the $ 80,000 loan was made in July. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 37, who took over as general manager of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontiac </PERSON> when his father was elected in 1986, supported his father's statement that he borrowed the money only so it would earn higher interest than it was getting `` He called up and asked if I could use $ 80,000 in the dealership operation,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> recalled of his talk with his father last July. `` I said yes. I'd say yes to anyone who had $ 80,000 to loan me.'' `` He said it was the inaugural fund and it was just sitting there,'' the younger <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> recalled. `` He wanted to roughly double the interest it was getting. `` I needed the money, but the rate of interest had to be reasonable. I did n't want him to stiff me,'' the younger <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said with a laugh. `` Of course, I knew he would n't.''

<TEXT>
 About 200 guerrillas blew a hole in the wall of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s largest prison Friday, entered the compound and fought guards in a half-hour battle that left two people dead, officers reported. Gen. <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Golcher </PERSON>, deputy security minister, told reporters about 10 prisoners escaped from the <LOCATION> Mariona </LOCATION> penitentiary just north of the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as the lestist guerrillas withdrew. No guerrilla casualties were reported. Officials did not give a breakdown on the number of common criminals and the number of rebels held in <LOCATION> Mariona </LOCATION>, a facility that normally holds 1,000 prisoners. Seven guards were wounded by rifle fire and grenade shrapnel and `` some prisoners'' also were injured, <PERSON> Golcher </PERSON> said. `` There are probably some dead,'' he added. A guard interviewed by journalists as he left the prison said two civilian employees were killed. Some inmates set fires as the left-wing rebels launched their attack in the early afternoon, according to the guard. He said `` about 200'' guerrillas made the assault and <PERSON> Golcher </PERSON> reported a large number managed to get into the prison grounds during the `` very strong'' attack. A first-aid worker said three civilian employees suffered serious bullet wounds and were taken by ambulances to hospitals. Journalists were kept hundreds of yards away from the penitentiary as scores of soldiers were rushed to the prison. Two helicopters flew over the compound. The guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed government since 1979.

<HEAD>Attorney Says Documents Prove Army LSD Testing On Torture-Murder
Defendant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lawyer for a man accused of murdering two women and shackling four others in a basement torture chamber said Friday he has obtained files that will prove his client was the subject of Army LSD tests in the 1960s. `` I found that my client was a guinea pig for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and it will be proven beyond any doubt,'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` If I were to pay rent on the files by the square foot, I'd be broke.'' One year ago, police found three half-naked women chained to a sewer pipe in the basement of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s house after being led there by a woman who said she had escaped from the captor. Limbs of another woman were found packaged in the freezer and another body was found in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> forest. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said he plans to argue during the trial set to begin April 4 that <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was insane and the hallucinogen LSD aggravated his schizophrenia. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> documents show <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was the subject of LSD tests between 1961 and 1963. An Army spokesman said the service's records did not show such testing. `` Nothing exists in his Army record on file. It is not known what is part of his record on file with the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rixon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Calls to the VA late Friday afternoon went unanswered. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> granted <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> 100 percent psychiatric disability after he was discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1963. The Pentagon has said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> initially set the diability level much lower after concluding <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s condition pre-dated his induction. In another development Friday, <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> withdrew an agreement with <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s creditors that would have assigned two-thirds of book and movie profits to his alleged victims. The other third would go to <LOCATION> Peruto </LOCATION> in lieu of attorney's fees. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said he withdrew the arrangement, filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, because the district attorney's office objected. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> and a now-defunct church he founded, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, are in bankruptcy. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumberg </PERSON> said Wednesday that state law provides that 100 percent of such book or movie profits goes to the victims. Peruto holds a $ 100,000 judgment note against <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s estate, guaranteeing his fee.

 Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers fought in the <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> mountains Friday for control of a strategic area east of the <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oil fields, which produce more than half the oil that finances <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war effort. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, spokesman for Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, said Friday that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team of experts will travel to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to see victims of what <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claims was an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attack with chemical weapons. Each side claimed to have shot down four of the other's warplanes during the battle on the northern front <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its Revolutionary Guards killed or wounded 500 Iraqis in heavy fighting east of <PERSON> Sayyid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON>. Both sides used warplanes and helicopter gunships in the battle. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed its warplanes scored `` accurate and effective hits'' on two tankers off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the night. There was no immediate confirmation from maritime executives. Reports from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said the Iranians hit <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern provincial capital, and five other border cities farther north with missile and artillery barrages. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamadan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shushtar </PERSON> in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported 10 civilians killed and 22 wounded. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 53 people were killed in the Iraqi raids. Towns and cities on both sides of the frontier have been battered regularly since the war began in September 1980. Both sides have fired more than 250 missiles into each others capitals and other cities cities since Feb. 29, killing hundreds of civilians. Foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, said they would press the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to force a cease-fire on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iranians left the meeting Thursday, accusing the delegates of serving only <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s interest. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons on Kurdish rebels, in violation of international agreements. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation was making the visit at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s request. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would send a special emissary for peace talks at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had requested the consultations on efforts to implement a cease-fire resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last year. Dispatches of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Revolutionary Guards pushing into northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> mauled four infantry battalions and a brigade, totaling around 7,500 men. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> identified the brigade as part of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, an element in the defense network that protects <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> from periodic Iranian thrusts across the southern border. That indicated the Iraqis had moved forces from the south, where about half their 1 million soldiers are concentrated, to counter the northern offensive. According to the agency, fighting centered on the <LOCATION> Rishan </LOCATION> mountains east of <PERSON> Sayyid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON>, the apparent Iranian objective in the latest phase of the 10-day-old assault. An Iranian force of at least 30,000 men was said to be five miles west of the town, an important transportation hub, on Thursday after a two-pronged drive 10 miles across the border that cut off many <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said four Iraqi fighter-bombers were shot down by ground fire Friday and the pilots killed. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said anti-aircraft fire downed four Iranian jets in the battle zone and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> fighters destroyed four helicopters. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims its soldiers have killed or wounded 11,000 Iraqis during the northern offensive, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200 tanks and armored vehicles. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says thousands of invaders have been killed, but admits losing several towns. By Iranian accounts, Revolutionary Guards reached a position 5 miles east of <PERSON> Sayyid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> after overrunning several other towns since the offensive began March 16. They are said to control the area around the eastern shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> and hills overlooking a major hydroelectric dam, on the southern edge of the lake, that provides power for much of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Western military analysts said the Iranians could use the captured territory as the base for a drive southward, behind <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defense lines in the central sector of the 730-mile border just 80 miles east of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. That could threaten the <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oilfields, 80 miles west of <PERSON> Sayyid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON>. They are heavily defended and produce about 1.5 million barrels of crude a day, more than half <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s total production.

<TEXT>
 About 30,000 striking teachers rallied in front of the federal government building Friday, demanding higher wages to end a walkout that has idled 7.2 million schoolchildren. The protesters are among 505,000 public school instructors who remain off the job. Primary school teachers went on strike March 14, the first day of the Argentine school year, and were joined Monday by secondary school teachers. No violence was reported during the giant rally in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the seat of the federal government. Teachers waved placards, taunted the government and listened to remarks by union leaders. Teachers are seeking a minimum salary of $ 118 a month. The government has countered with an offer of $ 84 a month, saying it can not afford more because of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economic crunch. The teachers' union, the Confederation of Educational Workers of the <LOCATION> Argentine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, is part of the four million-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s largest and most influential union. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s foreign debt of $ 50 billion is among <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest and payment of interest on the debt seriously drains its reserves Inflation in 1987 was 175 percent, more than twice the rate of 1986.

 Despite promises of horse-diapers and careful drivers, this luxury resort has said neigh to a $ 100-an-hour horse-and-carriage service similar to those operated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Central Park. `` Horses are lovely animals.

 The armed forces that keep Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in power went unpaid Friday and the broke and beleaguered government ordered businesses closed by the general strike to reopen. In a decree issued under a week-old state of emergency, the civilian government that does <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s bidding said it would take away the commercial licenses of any businesses `` offering goods and services to the public'' if they remained closed. The decree specifically mentioned grocery stores, pharmacies, transportation companies and gasoline stations. An estimated 90 percent of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s industry and businesses have shut down in the strike, called to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal as the head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces that includes the military and police. The government's inability to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> kindled hopes in the opposition that loyalty for him will wane. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, including a secretary at military headquarters, said army, <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, police and air force personnel did not receive their semi-monthly paychecks as scheduled Friday. `` We did not receive our wages and we were not told when we would receive them,'' said the secretary, who declined to give her name. Soldiers questioned by reporters also said they had not been paid. In mid-March, most of the 130,000 public employees were given partial payment of at least $ 75 on their salaries. Those employees whose monthly salaries are $ 1,000 or more were not paid. Social security checks have been postponed. Demonstrators at the Roman Catholic cathedral protested the church's failure to issue a denunciation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as expected. Pilots who guide ships through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and claimed they had been harassed by soldiers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> demanded protection and met with the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Some pilots had spoken of a strike, but commission spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Castsrellon </PERSON> said the situation was resolved at the meeting. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` There is no problem now.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained obstinate. He was asked at a military ceremony about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s renewed call for his departure and he replied: `` My president is called -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and my geographic space is called <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> I do n't take orders from extra-terrestrials.'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was named chief executive by the legislature when President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted on Feb. 26, the day after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Two members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Reps. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostmayer </PERSON>, D-Pa., ended a two-day visit Friday and told a news conference they thought the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should increase economic pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on narcotics charges. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has cut the flow of money to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. A threat to seize stores that refuse to open was in Decree No. 16 issued under the state of emergency that enables the government to act as it deems necessary `` to secure public order,'' including suspending civil liberties. It did not say how authorities would force businesses to open. Another decree issued Friday said any establishment that had been closed for the past five days and sold food, meats or canned goods `` can not reopen unless it is first inspected by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.'' It said store owners who do not comply face `` temporary suspension of their licenses or, in case of repeated violations, the cancellation of their commercial licenses.'' The strike began Monday and was called by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a broad alliance of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opposition. Crusade leaders said it would continue until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was ousted. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> employees have worked throughout protests and general strikes against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that began last June. The canal continues to operate normally while the nation around the waterway is at a virtual standstill. Most of the canal's 230 pilots are American citizens. Soldiers man roadblocks around the capital and they demand identification from drivers, search cars and rummage through personal belongings. Some pilots complained about those actions. About 100 people stalked out of the cathedral after Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> opened a special Mass by telling worshipers and observers the church would not issue the anticipated anti-Noriega statement. `` We do n't know how this mistaken rumor originated,'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. `` We are sorry, but it is not our fault.'' Civic Crusade leaders and <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> had said they had been assured the church would issue a strong condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Those who walked out stood on the steps of the gray stone cathedral chanting, `` Justice! Justice!'' and `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go!'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> told those remaining inside that he and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had a `` preparatory meeting'' Thursday. He did not explain and said he could not discuss the conversation.

<HEAD>Active Duty Rosters Down in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The active-duty strength of the nation's military services declined in February from both the previous month and the year-earlier period, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday As of Feb. 29, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had 2,163,193 men and women on active duty, down 2,625 from Jan. 31 and a decrease of 8,914 from the Feb. 28, 1987, tally. It is not unusual for military strength to swing up and down on a monthly basis during the year, primarily because of differences in the flow of new recruits. The strength totals are expected to vary even more widely than normal this year, though, because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is reducing its active-duty strength in a budget-cutting move. According to the latest `` Military Strength'' assessment, three of the four armed services reported personnel reductions in February. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> reported 198,231 men and women on active duty, down just 12 from January. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had 603,599 on active duty, down 975; and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> listed 776,415, down 2,308. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, meantime, reported an increase of 670 personnel in February, with 584,948 on active duty at the end of the month. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported declines in strength compared with Feb. 28, 1987, while the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reported slightly increases.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is lending nine rare works of Islamic art for an exhibition of ancient <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> art and culture planned next year at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sackler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, it was announced Thursday. The art works from the Hermitage Museum in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and the State Armory at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have been seen rarely outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and never in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Soviet loan will include a pair of 14th century gold bowls with dragon handles, two 15th century bronze oil lamps commissioned by the Central Asian warlord <PERSON> Timur </PERSON>, also known as <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION>, and a polychrome tile mosaic from <PERSON> Timur </PERSON>'s monumental tomb in <LOCATION> Samarkand </LOCATION>. In exchange, the Sackler gallery and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> museum will lend master Islamic paintings, calligraphies and ceramic vessels to be exhibited at the Hermitage for its 225th anniversary next year. The exchange was authorized by a protocol signed recently by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> museum under terms of a cultural agreement reached at the 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The American exhibition, `` Timur and the Princely Vision: Persian Art and Culture in the 15th Century,'' will appear at the Sackler from April 14, 1989, through July 9 and in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from Aug. 13 through Nov. 5.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reaffirmed its decision to abolish its policy requiring broadcasters to air conflicting views of controversial issues. The action will allow a lawsuit filed by supporters of the fairness doctrine to go forward in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-0 to deny reconsideration of its Aug. 4 decision to scrap the doctrine on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment and chilled broadcasters' coverage of controversial issues of public importance. `` We anticipated this. We're happy the commission finally acted'' so the court case can move along, said attorney <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, are asking the court to revive the doctrine. The case before the court stems from allegations by the <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> station WTVH-TV in <LOCATION> Syracyse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, violated the fairness doctrine by broadcasting editorial advertisements favoring construction of a local nuclear power plant without presenting opposing views. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to abolish the doctrine infuriated Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who mustered the votes to pass legislation to reinstate the policy but were unable to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the measure These supporters say they will make another attempt to revive the policy this year, against the wishes of broadcasters who oppose the doctrine.

<TEXT>
 Two men were charged Friday with murdering five supermarket employees during a robbery Sept. 4 in which the victims were shot in the back of the head after being ordered to lie on the floor. One suspect was arrested without incident Friday after a grand jury handed up the indictments; the other remained at large, said police Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>. Each was charged with five counts of murder, one of robbery and two of assault in connection with two supermarket employees who were wounded in the hold-up after closing time by gunmen posing as a cleaning crew. Investigators have said they believe the two gunmen surprised and shot to death a supermarket security guard. The four other slain employees, including a 16-year-old bag boy, were shot while lying on the floor. The gunmen robbed the cash register of several hundred dollars. Most of the store's cash was kept in a safe that could be opened only with the help of a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> guard, police said. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> said the key to the arrests was the discovery of the security guard's .38 - caliber revolver in the trunk of a car <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION> police stopped for The police captain said the investigation continued another four months because `` a lot of information needed to be checked into.'' <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> had been jailed since November on charges of receiving stolen property and unlawful use of the guard's weapon, but posted bail in the last week or two and remained at large, <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> said. The other suspect, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION>, was taken into custody Friday, <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON> said more people may have been involved in the crime. `` I'm pleased we've got the indictments, but there's more work to be done,'' he said. `` We're still at a critical point in this investigation. There are still a lot of things we ca n't tell you.'' Relatives of the victims expressed relief. `` It brings a little justice if they got the right people,'' said <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Spahn </PERSON>, the widow of the slain security guard, 27-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Spahn </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Questioning House Plan To Kill Trident Funding</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon on Thursday expressed reservations to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's plan to kill funding for a Trident nuclear submarine and instead build two destroyers that would give <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> more security without disclosing secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. `` It really is n't the answer,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seapower subcommittee voted this week to delete the administration's request for $ 1.4 billion for a 16th Trident submarine in the fiscal 1989 budget. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., subcommittee chairman and architect of the funding maneuver, is wary of an administration plan to sell sophisticated Aegis radar systems to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for new Japanese destroyers Instead, he wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to build two extra Aegis DDG-51 destroyers and station them in Japanese waters under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control, a move that would provide <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with extra security while not divulging technology. But <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s plan would hinder <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to have <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> patrol its own waters. Under an agreement reached early in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to patrol waters out to 1,000 miles and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would cover the rest of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` What we're trying to do is get <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to do more, not to do less,'' <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. `` All of a sudden, we would be taking their mission.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, however, said keeping a tight rein on technology secrets should take precedent. `` I just do n't want them to have our secret of our Aegis ships,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It's not just against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. We should n't unnecessarily share a secret with anyone. ... It opens another channel of opportunity for spies.'' The issue comes before the full <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next week, and Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., plans to oppose the move, said a congressional source who spoke on condition of anonymity <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he did not know if the full committee would support his plan. He said that if he loses, he will take his case to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, where he predicted he would prevail. Meanwhile, lawmakers from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where Tridents are built by the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, vowed to fight the move. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary, wrote to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members urging them to reject the <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> proposal. `` At a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense resources are so stretched, and when increased burden-sharing by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been endorsed by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it seems unwise to sacrifice a crucial Trident submarine in favor of this new naval commitment of questionable merit,'' <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said. The 18,750-ton Tridents each carry 24 long-range, multi-warhead missiles. Trident contracts create thousands of jobs in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> at Electric Boat's plants in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, R.I.

<HEAD>Eastern Air Shuttle Case Moves to Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The legal battle between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its largest union over the carrier's proposed sale of its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> air shuttle service moved to a higher court Thursday. Attorneys for Eastern filed papers with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, asking for dismissal of an earlier ruling that the airline was in contempt. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, who on March 10 found the airline in contempt for attempting to sell the shuttle, on Wednesday denied <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request that he overturn his own ruling. The case pits the Miami-based carrier against the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 12,000 mechanics and other ground workers at Eastern. The union and the airline are in mediation seeking new contract terms. Eastern, whose parent company is <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed selling its shuttle to another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary for $ 225 million. Company officials say Eastern needs cash, but union leaders say the sale is simply an attempt to pare the union's membership The shuttle flies between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and earned a $ 17 million profit for Eastern last year. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 182 million in 1987. In another dispute, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last July to refrain from taking any actions that would alter the machinists' working conditions. On March 10, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> ruled that the proposed shuttle deal violated that order. Eastern's lawyers also want dismissal of sanctions <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> levied against the airline on Monday. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> forbade Eastern to pursue government permission to sell the shuttle, and threatened $ 10,000-per-day fines for future transgressions.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He'd Consider Hispanic Runnning Mate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fielding questions in English and Spanish, Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday denounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and said he would consider a Hispanic running mate. Courting the Hispanic vote in the nation's largest Spanish-language media market, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he favored a one-year extension in the deadline for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty. Asked in Spanish if a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket would consider a Hispanic as a vice-presidential running mate, he answered `` Tal vez -LRB- perhaps -RRB-,'' adding: `` Vamos a ver -LRB- We'll see -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who noted his own ethnic background as the son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants, impressed some Spanish-speaking reporters with his command of the language, although he spoke carefully and a translation was sometimes requested. Invited to a question-and-answer session were reporters, editors and executives of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Spanish-language media: three daily newspapers, two television stations and at least five radio stations. In blasting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policies, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> deserved much of the credit for the recent cease-fire agreement between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's backing of the Contras and recent dispatch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> did nothing to contribute to the peace process, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared. On the amnesty issue, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for extending the May 4 deadline by which illegal aliens must apply for temporary resident status another year. But regardless of whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> extends the deadline, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that as president he would ensure that the immigration bureaucracy does not break up families in cases where only some members qualify for amnesty. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration Reform Act offers resident status to illegal aliens who can prove they have lived continuously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the last five years. It also sets stiff penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. Asked about the minimum wage, a perennial concern of minority groups, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for an increase. `` I do n't see how you can support a family on $ 3.35 an hour,'' the candidate said.

<HEAD>Massive State Spending Reduces Unemployment, Fuels Inflation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government's massive program of public works has created jobs but fueled inflation in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation, a top presidential aide said `` It's not that we do n't want stability. That's a top goal of the <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> government,'' Technical Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caram </PERSON> said in an interview before leaving with President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> on Thursday for a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` But it has to be understood that we have to sacrifice now in order to strengthen the base for tomorrow's growth,'' <PERSON> Caram </PERSON> said. `` For that, we have to make sacrifices today.'' <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> was scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday and then with officials of international lending agencies. On <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>'s agenda was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar quota, which he wants increased, and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s $ 4 billion foreign debt The government's $ 600 million program of construction of roads, bridges, schools and hospitals has created 210,000 jobs within the last year, <PERSON> Caram </PERSON> said. The money, to be spent through <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>'s four-year term, has spurred the country's economic growth rate to 9 percent, he added But it also touched off double-digit inflation that private economists say is closer to 40 percent than the official government figure of 30 percent. The foreign exchange value of the peso, the Dominican currency, has declined steadily since and now is worth less than 20 cents. Just four years ago the peso traded evenly with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. Increases in prices of gasoline, milk, rice and other basic commodities earlier this month touched off strikes and skirmishes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths. The clashes threatened to escalate into full-scale riots such as occurred in April 1984, when more than 100 people died. <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> fended off protestors by pledging to increase the minimum wage by 30 percent to $ 75 a month, and to implement price controls. Representatives from the government, labor, private business and the influential <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> are to meet for a second time in early April. Politically, the 80-year-old <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> seems to be in firm control. He began a fifth presidential term in August 1986 after being out of office for two consecutive terms. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, split into camps supporting former presidential candidate <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Majluta </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domingo </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, has not sought to use the unrest to challenge <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>.

In 1983, the quota was 525,000 tons a year. In 1987, revenue from sugar sales was a record low $ 150 million. <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> also would like international lending agencies to ease his country's debt repayment schedule, which last year totaled $ 700 million, or almost the entire value of Dominican exports. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bishops To Discuss AIDS Education at June Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops, at odds over what role the church should play in AIDS education, will discuss the issue at their June meeting in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the president of the national bishops conference said Thursday. Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said the administrative board of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> decided at its two-day session, which ended Thursday, to schedule a discussion of `` the pastoral, theological and moral dimensions of AIDS.'' The board agreed that the discussion should `` be open-ended in format with its direction determined by the will of the bishops,'' May said. He added that the discussion at the June 24-27 meeting in <LOCATION> Collegeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, would be held in executive session. The bishops conference's board recommended last December that condom use be explained in church-sponsored AIDS education programs, touching off a spate of criticism from conservative bishops. Those bishops, led by cardinals <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said they would not allow condom use to be explained or discussed in their dioceses' schools, hospitals and youth programs. And they argued that abstinence is `` the only morally acceptable way to avoid the sexual transmission of AIDS.'' AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is spread through close contact with blood or semen from infected persons. The conservative bishops were particularly concerned that the bishops conference's 50-member board had made the condom recommendation without a full vote of the conference's 380 members. In the wake of the criticism, May had suggested that the full body of bishops discuss the issue at their meeting in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and the administrative board made that recommendation official.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> won permission Thursday to use whatever is left of his skimpy 1988 campaign fund toward paying off the $ 1.15 million debt from his 1984 presidential campaign. He can not use any of the $ 1.12 million in federal matching funds he received, however, leaving the prospect of only a projected $ 100,000 or so in the kitty to transfer to the 1984 creditors once the 1988 accounts are settled, his campaign said. Somewhat ironically, it was only <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s exit from the 1988 race this month that won him <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> permission to transfer the funds. Were he still a candidate, he would be excluded from using the 1988 money for anything other than 1988 campaign-related expenses, the commission ruling said. He had submitted the request before he quit the race on March 11, so the commission was in a position of applying a different set of rules to the question. Once a campaign is concluded, the leftover money can be used for any lawful purpose, election regulations state. That would include paying some of the 1984 debts. But it is unclear how much money <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> will have left by the time he pays winding down costs and the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> conducts its lengthy audit process. He must return to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> anything left of the federal matching funds that he received this year. Matching funds accounted for about one-third of his total fund raising for 1988. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s campaign attorney, <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, said the campaign was pleased with the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> decision. He anticipated that after final 1988 bills are paid, the campaign will have about $ 110,000 leftover to apply to the 1984 debt. Commissioner <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> at Thursday's meeting raised doubts that any any significant amount will remain. `` We're going to be talking about a small trickle of money as against the'84 debt,'' she said. And the ruling Thursday does not end the saga of <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s nearly four-year-old debt, and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> will still work on raising money to pay the rest. `` Nobody is running away,'' he said, but he could not specify what kind of fund-raising efforts will be undertaken by the former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator. Some creditors have taken <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> to court _ so far unsuccessfully _ to try and place liens on the 1988 funds to recoup money they are owed from 1984. One creditor got a court order that resulted in federal marshals seizing $ 30,000 in proceeds at a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> fund-raiser for <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> last year. Two businesses filed suit in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tri-State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Envelope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, claims <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> owes it $ 133,600. Semper-Moser Associates of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, an advertising agency, claims it is owed $ 172,920. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s most recent campaign financial statement showed that at the end of February he had $ 488,966 in cash on hand and $ 34,661 in bills to pay. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> audit staff will probably begin its audit in the summer. The agency audits all presidential campaigns as a routine once the campaign is concluded. The agency was still finishing up 1984 audits last year. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> decision Thursday came in response to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s second request on the same topic. He first asked if he could use 1988 funds toward the 1984 debt last spring. But after the commission denied him federal matching funds on the basis that he was not an active candidate, his campaign withdrew the request as moot. He withdrew from the race for the first time in May in the wake of disclosures about his relationship with part-time <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> re-entered the race last fall, he resubmitted the request in hopes of wiping out the nagging 1984 debt.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has refused an immediate ban on the spraying of herbicides on federal rangeland in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In an order made public Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied an emergency injunction sought by rural and environmental groups. The court said it would explain its reasons later. However, no spraying is expected until at least late spring, said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Grier </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, one of the groups filing suit. She said she hoped the court would rule before then on the groups' appeal of a decision by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> who ruled the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> had adequately studied the environmental effects of the weed-killer. The chemicals, including the controversial 2,4-D, are to be sprayed on weeds that threaten forage or cause other harmful effects on <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> land in the two states. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> blocked the spraying in 1984, ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental analysis had not considered the range of possible danger to humans. The agency, supported in the case by a group of farmers and ranchers, revised its analysis last year and concluded that under the worst foreseeable circumstances, the herbicides were still relatively safe. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> in November lifted his injunction. At a hearing March 7 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, opponents asked the appellate court to reinstate the ban while it considers their appeal of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' ruling. The appellate court's unanimous order Thursday did not address the merits of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' ruling, which remains under appeal. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLorenzo </PERSON>, a lawyer for a group of farmers, ranchers and herbicide users called Oregonians for Food and Shelter, said he was encouraged by the court's decision. The group considers the herbicides safe. But Ms. <PERSON> Grier </PERSON> said the government agency had ignored studies showing health problems and had failed to consider non-chemical approaches. The bureau `` should have looked at how to prevent problems before they exist,'' she said. `` Are we managing our lands in a way that encourages problem weeds? Could we alter the use of land by livestock in a way that would make the land less susceptible to noxious weed problems?''

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> announced Thursday that it is clarifying instructions to sales representatives and mailing information to customers following charges of deceptive sales practices. The announcement came after the state attorney general and consumer advocate filed a suit and a complaint alleging the state's biggest phone company stuck customers with such options as call waiting, three-way calling and speed calling While insisting the allegations were unjustified, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> <PERSON> Filtz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> vice president and chief operating officer, said the telephone company was taking steps to resolve what he called confusion about the options. `` We are going beyond what normally we would do to strengthen and clarify and assure there is absolutely no misunderstanding in terms of what customers order, what options they get, what the value of those options is -LRB- and -RRB- what the prices are,'' <PERSON> Filtz </PERSON> said. `` We believe we go the extra mile to make sure that customers are fully informed about their services, and have every opportunity to change it whenever they wish.'' State Consumer Advocate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barasch </PERSON> said the company is `` at least in part admitting the allegations we've been making.'' But the state has not withdrawn the suit filed Monday in state court or the complaint filed with the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The allegations made by <PERSON> Barasch </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> were based on 32 test calls made to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> representatives. Of those calls, more than 70 percent were assigned one, two or three optional services they had not requested or were not told were optional. In one case, an agent posing as a single mother on welfare was assigned service at $ 28.55 monthly, when basic service could have been obtained for $ 6.65 per month, the officials said. <PERSON> Barasch </PERSON> alleged the representatives were subject to quotas or `` bonus'' plans geared to the optional services. <PERSON> Filtz </PERSON> said the workers did not receive commissions but can qualify for prizes including toasters, appliances and pizza lunches based on sales performance. In a complaint filed with the <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barasch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> representatives followed guidelines directing them to include certain options, including a maintenance plan, when recommending rates to new customers. The `` clarified'' guidelines do not include such instructions, and also specify that customers be told the services such as call forwarding and call waiting are optional. Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> has more than 3.7 million customers, or about 80 percent of the state's telephone lines. The <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> complaint and the lawsuit seek fines, an end to the allegedly deceptive sales practices, and customer refunds that <PERSON> Barasch </PERSON> said could involve millions of dollars.

<TEXT>
 Federal authorites raided espionage suspects Thursday and made at least one arrest, the Bild daily newspaper reported. `` Numerous offices and apartments were searched in connection with the operation,'' it said, citing unidentified security experts. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said the raids may have been connected to the arrest of <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> last Friday as a spy suspect. She was working as a secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> worked in the West German chancellory from 1974 to 1977 and in several ministries in later years. The brief Bild account, which was to appear in Friday editions, gave no details. It was telexed to other news organizations in advance late Thursday. Government officials could not be reached for comment immediately. Ms. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> is suspected of having worked as a spy for years, according to the Federal Prosecutor's Office. She is being held in investigative custody and has not yet been charged with any crimes, officials said. In the last major spy scandal to rock the government, 15 communist agents were arrested or disappeared between August and December 1985.

 A family trying to force payment of a $ 4 million jury award has obtained a freeze on the city's bank accounts, apparently plunging this desperately poor community into a payroll crisis. At least $ 85,000 in city checks were outstanding when the accounts were frozen Wednesday, including about $ 37,000 in paychecks issued March 15 but not yet cashed by municipal employees, said city Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` That kind of puts us in a destitute situation,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frierson </PERSON>. `` My real interest right now is payroll. That's critical. Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> Officer and city attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did not return calls Thursday, but officials have said there was no way a municipality with an annual budget of about $ 6 million could afford to pay a $ 4 million. The money was awarded in 1985 to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man who suffered permanent brain damage when he was beaten by a fellow inmate in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> jail. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the city of 55,000 people to pay the judgment, clearing the way for the <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> family to seize its bank accounts. On Wednesday, city accounts containing about $ 1.2 million were frozen at four local banks. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON>'s attorney, said he did not think the city would file for bankruptcy in federal court, a move that would put a court-appointed trustee in control of municipal funds. `` They do n't want a trustee running the city,'' he said `` As far as the people of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> are concerned, this is n't going to hurt the citizens any more than they already are,'' he said. `` They already do n't get their trash picked up.

 A former nuclear technician who claimed he revealed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s atomic secrets for the good of humanity was convicted Thursday of espionage and treason and could be sentenced to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, 34, was found guilty by a three-judge panel after a trial that had been closed to the public since it began in September. His lawyer said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> would appeal the verdict to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> is very disappointed,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Avigdor </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>. `` The court decided that he was a traitor, and he had hoped to be seen differently. But he is not broken. He is looking ahead to the appeal.'' The conviction carries a maximum sentence of death. However, prosecutor <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasson </PERSON> said he would ask the court for a sentence of life imprisonment, which in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is limited to 20 years. Sentencing is set for Sunday. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, who worked nine years at the nuclear facility in <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION>, was charged for revealing details of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s atomic capacity to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986. The newspaper said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s information showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had stockpiled the world's sixth-largest nuclear arsenal. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> never has responded directly to allegations of its nuclear capacity, saying only it would not be the first country to introduce such weapons into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> has insisted he made his revelations to alert the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons. The state argued he intended to harm <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. He was kept under heavy security during the trial, which was closed to the public because authorities feared an open hearing would harm state security. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> has been held in near isolation for the last 18 months and has been permitted to see only his attorney and family. The precautions were taken after <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> managed to flash a message to reporters at a pre-trial appearance by scribbling it on the palm of his hand. In the message he said he had been kidnapped in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, presumably by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents, and brought to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for trial. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was fired from the <LOCATION> Dimona </LOCATION> nuclear center in 1985 and went to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where he became acquainted with a priest and converted to Christianity. He later traveled to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but disappeared in October 1986, just days before <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published his revelations. Israeli officials acknowledged several weeks later he was in custody in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Details of <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>'s journey back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were revealed by his brother, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was lured from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman named <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, who promised him sex. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, he was abducted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents and spirited home, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said. During the trial, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> argued <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> did not hurt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security because information about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear capacity was available in the academic world He said <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> had in fact helped state security because allegations of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear strength served as a deterrent to Arab enemies. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, editor of The Sunday Times, said Thursday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was warned of the risks before divulging his information. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> replied he was prepared to take them because he wanted Israelis to know their country was a nuclear power. `` But we will always regret that he did not take our warnings seriously enough, with the tragic consequences of his abduction which followed,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> said his paper was concerned about the way <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> was taken from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and regretted he was convicted. `` We understand that democratic governments must protect secrets in the national interest and that most Israeli citizens regard <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> as a traitor,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> said. `` But the citizens of every other democratic nuclear power are not debarred from knowing that their countries have nuclear weapons _ the nature of the defense of their countries is one of their fundamental democratic rights.''

<HEAD>Stocks Tumble; Personal Income, Spending Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices tumbled Thursday even as the government reported that Americans' personal incomes and consumer spending surged in February. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 43.77 points to 2,023.87. Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> whose composite index dropped 2.82 to 149.00. Analysts cited a continued decline in the dollar, which fell to its lowest level in nearly two months against the Japanese yen and West German mark, as contributing to the weakness in stocks. In its latest eonomic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal incomes advanced 0.9 percent in February, reflecting strong employment gains in the past few months. Spending rose 0.7 percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent January increase. Meanwhile, the government reported the savings and loan industry last year recorded its worst annual loss since the Great Depression. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said a $ 3.2 billion loss in the last three months of 1987 pushed the industry's red ink for the year to a record $ 6.8 billion. That was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous post-Depression record of a $ 4.6 billion, set in 1981.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must help free Iranian hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will intervene on behalf of Anglican envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and another missing Briton, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reported. A spokesman for Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said, `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> -RRB- is confirming that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> are alive and being well treated by captors that is indeed good news.'' At a news conference in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> attended by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must help free three missing Iranians kidnapped by right-wing Christian Phalangists in summer 1982. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> interpreted his remarks as indicating <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and British reporter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> were alive. They are among 24 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio report, broadcast in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, made no mention of non-British Western hostages. The longest held hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. `` <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said at first that he did not know if they were alive or dead,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said in a broadcast from the Iranian capital. But when pressed, he began to talk of the conditions for their release. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s personal envoy, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving his west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel to negotiate with an Islamic group in his efforts to gain the release of Western hostages. No claim of responsibility has even been made in <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s disappearance <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> -RRB- accepted that there was a clear difference between on the one hand Mr. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, from a religious background and Mr. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a journalist and, on the other, a spy or a military man.'' When <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said that the Iranians were almost certainly dead, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said someone should show <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the bodies. The news conference took place during an Iraqi air strike in which three missiles fell on the city. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> showed no reaction during the bombing. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a journalist for the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> agency, was kidnapped April 17, 1986. Two other Britons are being held, along with nine Americans and other nationalities.

<HEAD>Media Surrender Film Of Irish Attack On Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s broadcasting service said Thursday it gave British police video segments of an angry funeral mob attacking two soldiers at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral <ORGANIZATION> RTE </ORGANIZATION> turned over the videotape one day after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two television networks, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, complied with similar demands for unbroadcast footage from the funeral. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, denied British news reports that the two soldiers were on an undercover mission when they were hauled from their cars, beaten severely and then shot to death. The three networks initially refused to hand over unbroadcast film on the ground it would endanger crews covering future violence in the British-ruled province. They complied after the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, the provincial police force, threatened court action under British anti-terrorist legislation. The two British corporals, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, 23, were dragged from a car by a mob at an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> funeral in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Saturday. They were beaten with iron bars and then taken to a nearby soccer stadium, where <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas shot them to death. The crowd stopped TV crews filming when the soldiers were pulled from the car. <ORGANIZATION> RTE </ORGANIZATION> said two detectives called at its offices in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and took away a 65-second videotape of the attack. The network said most of the film was transmitted on the network. Security forces will examine the film to try to identify those who took part. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Thursday denied a report in the news, arts and current affairs magazine The Spectator that <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> were on an undercover mission in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> when attacked. They were in plainclothes in an unmarked car at the time. The Spectator, which supports the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We shall never be told, though it seems to be the case, that Cpls. Wood and <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> were on an undercover operation.'' It gave no other details. Members of the Royal Corps of Signals are often employed on surveillance work and other undercover activity. But a ministry spokesman, who in accordance with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> practice refused to be identified, said the claim in The Spectator was `` inconceivable.'' The army has said it thinks the soldiers may have become involved with the cortege purely by accident while on their way to their base at <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION> barracks south of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Austrian Parliament Approves Compensation To Nazi Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament has passed a law that will provide payments of up to $ 416 each to people victimized by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> when <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> was under German rule during World War II. The law, which had been planned for months, was passed Wednesday by all three main political parties in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Five of the six deputies from the small <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> voted against it, saying the measure provided too little compensation. Under the law, those deemed to have suffered under <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> rule will receive one-time payments of from $ 208 to $ 416 at current exchange rates. The payments vary depending on whether the potential recipient was persecuted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, forced to leave the country or served in the resistance. No estimates have been published of how many people will be eligible for payment. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallinger </PERSON>, the Socialist welfare minister in the coalition government, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> he hoped the payments would be understood as a symbolic gesture, since no sum could compensate for such suffering. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> sent his troops to annex <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to the Third Reich in March 1938, a move many Austrians welcomed. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> already pays small pensions to individuals persecuted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, however, it never paid compensation to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or any other state or group for Nazi crimes. The proposal was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> has been mired in a controversy over President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime past. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> served as a lieutenant in a German army unit in the occupied <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. His unit was linked to war crimes, including the deportation of Jews to concentration camps and the murders of partisans. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> kept his military service in the area secret until 1986 and has denied wrongdoing since. A historians' commission said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was in a position to know about Nazi war crimes and did nothing to stop them.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> on Thursday proposed a $ 1.93 billion budget that would turn trash collection over to a contractor, freeze wages and raise taxes for the first time since he took office in 1984. The mayor of the nation's fifth-largest city, in asking for a $ 67 million tax increase, left it up to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to decide which taxes to raise. The increase will help `` meet human needs, create jobs, promote economic development, care for and nurture our children and revitalize our neighborhoods,'' said <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, a Democrat elected in November to a second term. His budget for fiscal 1989, which starts July 1, represents a 6.4 percent increase over the current budget of $ 1.86 billion. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> proposed cutting $ 50 million in costs through new labor contracts or new contract terms and by turning over garbage collection to private industry, a move that could eliminate several thousand jobs and save $ 35 million annually. Garbage collection in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has come under attack as sloppy and rife with overtime abuse. `` I am a lifelong supporter of organized labor and while part of my financial plan anticipates privatization, which they may find difficult, I am resolute in pursuing this only to the extent that labor fails to work with the city to find meaningful and cost effective alternatives,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. The mayor's budget offers no wage increase to the city's blue-and white-collar employees, whose contracts expire this summer The spending plan does not include the school system, which has proposed a $ 1 billion budget. It would add $ 44.3 million to basic services, which include police and fire protection, street cleaning, job training, housing rehabilitation and programs for children, the homeless and AIDS victims, who would receive $ 7.5 million. Tax revenue for the current fiscal year is projected at $ 1.4 billion. The mayor's spending plan for the coming year projects tax revenue of $ 1.5 billion. `` Everybody's inclination is against a tax increase,'' said Councilman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a Democrat. Republican Councilman <PERSON> Thacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> said he considered raising taxes `` a disgrace'' but also said it probably would be done. Council President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a Democrat, said: `` We are going to have to raise taxes or cut the budget tremendously.''

 The leftist Sandinista government and the Contra rebels each claimed on Friday that its own military pressure helped force the other to yield to a cease-fire plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, in their newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION>, called on citizens to prepare for ideological warfare to defend the ruling party against the Contras. The Contras hinted that if peaceful measures do n't bring about democratic reforms, they are prepared take up arms again. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said there were no reports of combat on Friday, five days after the two sides agreed to suspend offensive operations.

<HEAD>Streakers, Littlefeather and Tears</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the 60th Academy Awards are presented on April 11, the evening is likely to produce at least one magical moment that will last in the memories of those who watch <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s annual salute to itself. That has happened throughout Oscar's fabled history: one unscripted, unexpected and spontaneous moment that electrified the audience. Rarely have the awards failed to produce such an event. Everyone has his or her own favorite, and here are just a few: _ <PERSON> Sacheen </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefeather </PERSON>. In 1973, there was speculation that <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, nominated as best actor for `` The Godfather,'' might pull a surprise. He did. When <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> had won, a woman in a Native American costume came onstage and brushed away <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> as he tried to hand her the Oscar statuette. She said her name was <PERSON> Sacheen </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefeather </PERSON>, that she was Apache and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affirmative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Image </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> ... very regretfully can not accept this very generous award. And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry.'' The audience was stunned as she left the stage. _ The Naked Stranger. In 1974, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Niven </PERSON>'s introduction of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was suddenly interrupted by screams and laughter from the audience. <PERSON> Niven </PERSON> turned around just as a naked man flashing a peace sign raced past him. Streaking was the year's fad on college campuses and elsewhere. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> had the orchestra play `` Sunny Side Up,'' and the imperturbable <PERSON> Niven </PERSON> commented: `` Just think, the only laugh that man will probably ever get is for stripping and showing off his shortcomings.'' Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> came on stage and said, `` That's a pretty tough act to follow.'' _ The Tramp's Farewell. In 1972, the Academy voted <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> a special award. The event was packed with drama because it was <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s first return to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> since his self-exile 20 years before. The furor over his politics was forgotten. More important was the `` incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of the century.'' When <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> appeared onstage at the end of the ceremonies, the ovation was thunderous. Frail and overwhelmed, he did a little flipping trick with the black derby that was his trademark. _ Last of the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>. In 1979, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> was scheduled to appear at the awards despite his desperate fight with lung cancer. A trailer was parked outside the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Music Center so he could rest before his entrance. `` Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>,'' announced <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. When the cheers finally subsided, the <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> cracked, `` That's just about the only medicine a fella'd ever need.'' Within three months he was dead. _ A Sign of Thanks. Last year, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> was the favorite for best actress because of her role as the deaf woman in `` Children of a Lesser God.'' When her name was announced, the Music Center audience roared its approval. Miss <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>'s graceful hands described her gratitude, and her remarks were swiftly spoken by her interpreter. Her performance reminded many of <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>'s acceptance of her 1976 best actress award for `` One Flew Over the Cuckko's Nest.'' As she spoke her words, she used sign language for her parents, who were both deaf. _ <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> Says No. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> had once requested that his name be withdrawn as candidate for supporting actor in 1961 for `` The Hustler'' -LRB- the Academy declined -RRB-. So everyone wondered if he would accept the Oscar if he won for `` Patton'' in 1971. He won, and he would n't accept. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the producer of `` <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>,'' accepted <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s award, but it was never delivered. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s opionion of the awards: `` A two-hour meat parade.'' _ Miss <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> Returns. In 1957, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> was nominated as best actress for `` Anastasia.'' Would Hollywood forgive her desertion and disgrace when she mothered a child by <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> before they were married? It would. Her victory was a dramatic moment, even though she was n't at the awards to enjoy it. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> accepted for her and remarked: `` Dear Ingrid, if you can hear me or see this, I want you to know that we all send you our love and admiration.'' _ `` Aw, Coop.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who had won two Oscars during his career, was given an honorary Oscar in 1961 but he was not at the ceremonies. His close friend, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, accepted the award for him. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> began crying during his speech and could only say, `` Aw, Coop,'' before walking tearfully off stage. The world realized the desperate health of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who was too ill to attend. He died of cancer a month later. _ Kate Shows Up. The all-time acting winner with four Oscars, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> never appeared to collect her awards. Finally, in 1974 she came to the ceremonies to present the Thalberg award to her longtime, ailing producer, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON>. `` I'm the living proof someone can wait 41 years to be unselfish,'' said the indomitable <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Redux </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had been reported near death from pneumonia in 1961 when she was nominated for best actress in `` Butterfield 8.'' Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> herself had termed it `` the most pornographic script I have ever read,'' but she played the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> call girl so she could escape her MGM contract and star in `` Cleopatra.'' `` I do n't believe it!'' she exclaimed when <PERSON> Yul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brynner </PERSON> announced her the winner. She told the audience, `` Thank you with all my heart,'' then went backstage and fainted.

<HEAD>Economy After the Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 October's stock market crash had little impact on the economy, according to some university economists who base their judgment largely on numerical measurements. But there has been an impact, a very clear-cut one that can be detected without any instruments, including calculators. It can be seen in a strange bullishness in the stock market itself. It can be observed in the tendency of professional analysts to discount the good news about the economy that shows up in the statistical indicators. The impact, though not the expected one, shows in a strange propensity of investors to write off the collapse as an aberration _ to diminish its significance, for example, by calling it a `` change of leadership.'' Since the crash, some analysts point out, smaller stocks that had been ignored during the bull market have surged, along with rising volume. Some have risen 50 percent, re-igniting the hopes of many for a quick killing. The scent of potential profits is as strong and enticing as freshly brewed coffee. It spreads, and even those folks who lost the family jewels just a few months ago are enjoying the prospect of buying them back. Corporations have similar thoughts. Through March 7, a total of 15 deals of $ 1 billion or more were announced during 1988, or nearly half the total for all 1987, and some have been at unrealistically high prices. While a notion seems to prevail that the stock market can not be stopped from going higher, the exact opposite attitude is expressed about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Good economic reports are immediately discounted by analysts. If you had listened to the latter, the fourth quarter of 1987 was a time of economic downturn. But when the figures came in they showed the economy grew at 4.3 percent, later revised to 4.5 percent and this week to 4.8 percent. Economists expressed concern that consumers would drastically lower their spending because of -LRB- 1 -RRB- fears generated by the stock market collapse, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- their inability to continue taking on additional credit. It did n't happen. An accumulation of inventories _ of goods already made and still to be sold _ was expected to slow production during the early part of the year. But latest reports suggest the inventory problem is n't as big as had been feared Inflation was supposed to have menaced the economy by now, but instead it has acted like a groundhog that believes there'll be no summer. The February consumer price index rose at a 0.2 percent rate, a barely measureable amount. Deep-rooted doubts continue to exist among economists regarding the renewed health of manufacturing, although output by that sector accounted for 22 percent of gross natinal product last year, one of the highest percentages in 40 years. Concern prevails about the recovery of exports, the competitiveness of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods, the level of interest rates, the budget deficits and more. But in most instances, the news about these matters has been good. It's may be a puzzle for psychologists rather than economists. The stock market crash seems to have intensified existing fears about the economy, but not about the market itself. In fact, the temporarily depressed prices of stocks may have drawn in a brand-new set of speculators, just as the relatively healthy economy has produced more doubters.

<HEAD>`Frontline' Offers Candid Look at Soviets Under Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, a first-grader and the daughter of underground artists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, says she's afraid of what she will be asked at school the next day. The questions wo n't be about her lessons, but about the people who had visited her parents. When asked what she will reply, she tells the visitors, who are documentary filmmakers, that she will not tell her teachers that Americans were at her house, only `` daddy's friends.'' She shows them her stuffed cat and tells them the cat knows she should n't tell `` family secrets'' at school The documentary `` Back in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>,'' airing Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Frontline,'' illustrates the pervasive fears of Soviet citizens and the double lives some of them lead despite the economic and social reforms the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has launched The hour-long show looks at how the lives of the Soviets have changed in the last 20 years through the eyes of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist and his family who lived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the 1960s and returned last year for three months. <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife and grown children looked up old friends, artists, Jewish refuseniks, writers, political dissidents and others, and talked to them about <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, known as `` perestroika.'' The people they spoke with are the intelligentsia: those who have been <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s staunchest supporters and thus the ones with the most to lose if his experiment fails. Americans have been able to see many documentaries in recent years on the other superpower, including <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s current seven-hour `` Portrait of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' depicting the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> in glowing, flattering terms. How the `` Frontline'' documentary differs from the others is that its producers managed to conduct many interviews on camera without the presence of officials from <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>, the state broadcasting committee, who have always accompanied Western filmmakers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We negotiated a deal with them,'' says `` Frontline'' producer <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` It was unusual at the very least. If their presence would likely interfere with the conversation, I had the right to ask that he not be there.'' Thus, the camera crew was able to elicit thoughtful, candid answers in their interviews from subjects who otherwise might be intimidated by the presence of a member of <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>. Because members of the <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON> family speak Russian and know the country well, there's no need for state-supplied interpreters or guides who might stage events for the camera. In another candid scene, also shot without government intervention, a middle-aged couple strolls in a park with the Schecters in the rain under umbrellas. The couple, who lived through the era of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and saw his reforms blossom and fail, said they no longer want to stay in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, describing it as a land of `` lies and double-thinking.'' `` All thoughtful people hope perestroika wo n't stop,'' the woman says. `` They are afraid. People our age lived through the disappointment of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s times. That was a time of bitter disappointment.'' The crew also interviewed Jewish refuseniks who tell the painful tale of how their daughter has been allowed to emigrate while they have not, and of the anti-Semitism they have encountered. A dissident historian who spent time in a labor camp gives his wry views of Soviet leaders since <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Even when the subjects were part of the establishment, the `` Frontline'' crew seemed to get frank comments. At the state-controlled newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said officials initially tried to persuade her to photograph a formal editorial meeting. But she begged off, saying she did n't have enough lights. She opted instead for an informal daily afternoon bull session by a few editors over coffee in the cafeteria. There, the editors got into a lively debate on Soviet residency permits, which restrict where people live. An <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> editor shows off the stacks of mail the newspaper receives and tells of the letter he will print that day. It is from a reader who is afraid to embrace <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms because the government can not guarantee that one day, if the policies are reversed, those who speak out now wo n't be attacked as `` anti-Leninist.'' One answer is provided by <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefremov </PERSON>, an avant-garde theater director who is said to have been given a personal assurance of support by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Everybody is afraid of one thing: that it will all get covered up again,'' <PERSON> Yefremov </PERSON> says. The intelligentsia must `` push this thing farther and farther open. Then it will be impossible to cover it up again.''

<HEAD>Moyers Program on Evil Inevitably Discusses Good</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The title of `` Facing Evil, with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>'' evokes images of 90 minutes in front of the television in a dark depression contemplating the worst in human nature. Not so. As <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> says in his introduction to this surprisingly uplifting report, a discussion of the dark mystery of evil seems inevitably to lead to a celebration of the light. Part of <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' `` news of the mind'' series for <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, the former network journalist taped the special at a symposium called `` Understanding Evil,'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> and featuring a distinguished group of speakers, including poet <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelou </PERSON>, Holocaust scholar <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>, choreographer and author <PERSON> Chung-Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>, author <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON>, and Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, a Baptist preacher. Often as eloquent as the featured speakers are the audience members, ranging from a Holocaust survivor still struggling to understand what happened to her, to a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who says his experience `` has made me think of evil in another way, coming out of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, turning around and seeing it wearing my own face.'' The message from the program _ and it's never forced _ is that good and evil reside in the human spirit, and it takes an act of will to repress evil in favor of good. <PERSON> Angelou </PERSON>, a striking television presence, tells of being raped when she was 7. The man who attacked her was known to her family. Soon after he was released from jail, he was found dead, apparently kicked to death. The child believed she had brought on the man's death by speaking his name She did n't speak again for five years. A horrible thing to happen to a child. But, she said, during those five years, she sought solace in reading, everything she could get her hands on, memorizing poems, stories and plays. When she finally spoke again, she had truly found her voice, thanks to words and wisdom of others. <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON> still grapples with the concept of evil after a lifetime of study. A soldier in World War II, he says he is horrified to recall enjoying the violence of conflict. He was so moved by the story of courageous, peace-loving French villagers who disarmed the German invaders with love, he wrote a book about them and found himself transformed. But later, he realized, it was not the villagers who defeated <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, but those like himself who killed the Germans. <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON> likens the struggle between good and evil to the experience of being in a hurricane _ all around is fury, but there can still be blue sky above. To a quotation from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Santayana </PERSON>, `` In the midst of battle there is room for love,'' <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON> adds his own thought _ `` We can push back and expand the blue, but we're in the eye of the hurricane, and do n't ever forget it.'' <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> is more pessimistic, having studied the Holocaust and realized that it took thousands of typical _ and well-educated _ citizens to produce it. His presentation prompts audience members to wonder whether they could be caught up in evil mob psychology, be it Nazism or a lynching, if they had been there. It's a compelling 90 minutes, thanks to <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' insistence on presenting ideas, not neat conclusions. Stylistically Moyers ignores the accepted television tenet that talking heads are boring. He believes in the power of storytelling and pushes the camera up close, but avoids visual monotony by interspersing footage of the speakers at the podium with often emotional one-on-one interviews. He also artfully refers with the camera occasionally to the incongruously serene central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> landscape. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>, who has only been seen in a brief introduction, returns at the end of the program to offer, not a conclusion but a question _ if we can identify an evil act after it occurs, why ca n't we stop it before it happens? `` That we usually fail to see an act in time,'' he says, `` is as puzzling to me as the persistence of evil itself.''

 Soap opera mogul <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had a producer on the phone, was doing running commentary on the action on two TV monitors, and was adroitly fielding questions on the 15th anniversary of `` The Young and the Restless.'' Bell looked deceptively calm in the eye of the storm, but it was <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> generating the hurricane whirling about his penthouse office atop <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' Television City. He is the executive producer, head writer and co-creator, with his wife, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, of `` The Young and the Restless'' and `` The Bold and the Beautiful.'' At 15, `` Y & amp; R,'' as he usually calls it, is running neck and neck in the Nielsen ratings with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` General Hospital'' as the most popular daytime show. `` The Bold and the Beautiful,'' which just passed its first anniversary, was in ninth place in the ratings. `` I think we brought a new approach to daytime programming because we featured young people,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said of `` Y & amp; R.'' `` It's a very contemporary show and we make good use of music and closeups in ways that had n't been used before. Our stories are provocative. I wo n't say sensual because that would give the wrong impression, but sometimes they are.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said he is in good shape to weather the strike of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, provided it's settled soon. He has scripts for six weeks of `` The Young and the Restless'' and five weeks of `` The Bold and the Beautiful.'' In addition, he has several weeks of shows already taped. They are taped far in advance to get them overseas. As he talked to his visitor, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> relayed instructions to producers on the sets and commented on the taping and the actors on the screen. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> watched a young actor on the monitor for `` The Bold and the Beautiful.'' The actor was <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, the son of late film legend <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. `` Can you think of a better place for a young actor to train?'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> asked. `` They get new material every day, filled with conflicts and romance, and they get stretched every way possible.'' Later, daughter <PERSON> Lauralee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> came on the screen. She plays Cricket on `` Y & amp; R.'' One son, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, is a script writer, and another, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, runs business affairs for `` The Bold and the Beautiful.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> advertising executive and writer for other daytime serials, was lured away from his job as head writer of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Days of Our Lives'' to create a new show for CBS. `` <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> was the head of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> programming then and he paid me more to quit ` Days of Our Lives' than I was getting paid to do it,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had her own show in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and I went back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. There we were staring at a blank sheet of paper. We did 70 pages, which took the story through the first two years.'' Soap operas are difficult to establish because viewers are reluctant to break their viewing habits. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had hoped that `` The Young and the Restless'' would make a breakthrough, but when the ratings failed to climb he grew impatient and asked CBS to take it off the air. `` It was n't doing as well as I thought it should,'' he said. `` But <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> showed me ratings figures that convinced me to stay with it. It took the show a year and a half to get established. `` When you have a long-running show the audience grows older with the show,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. `` ` The Young and the Restless' was the first show to turn that around and attract a young audience for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>.'' In 1980 <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> did something that was unprecedented in daytime television. The show had begun with the focus on two families, the Fosters and the <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Several young actors decided to leave the show and it began to affect the two families. `` After one young actress told me she was leaving I knew it would be a mortal blow to try to replace her,'' he said. `` I'd already had to replace several other actors What I did was gradually move the focus from the Fosters and the <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and brought in two new families, the <ORGANIZATION> Abbotts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a fascinating thing, but we were also scared. We did n't know if it would work But the audience stayed with us and the show has grown in the ratings.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is a puzzle to conventional economists, a challenge to management and marketing people and, according to its discoverer, `` political dynamite'' for presidential contenders. It is the split personality of the American economy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has two economies, says <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>. There is what he calls the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, which has been sluggish of late. And there is the <ORGANIZATION> Heartland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, which has become more vigorous over the past two years. When compiling national figures, one tends to offset the other. When the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> boomed, the <ORGANIZATION> Heartland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> was in recession. Now the latter is thriving, at least relative to 1985, while the other one lags. The Heartland is based on manufacturing, agriculture, mining and forestry. It suffered badly between Memorial Day 1985 through February 1987. <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> referred to 31 states as being in recession then. Only four now are. The Coastal Economy is sited mostly on the Eastern and Western seaboards. Much of its strength depends on the service sector, including, of course, the various financial industries. It lost spunk following the stock market crash. In the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, which incidentally has gaps in its uniformity _ in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, for example, there has been a continued boom _ they worry about the billions of dollars that vanished in the stock crash. In the Heartland, says <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>, `` the decline in services and the crash have been only events on the evening news, as remote as news dispatches on the fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' How does <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> know all this? Because, as it has for three decades, <ORGANIZATION> Sindlinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, calls hundreds of households every week, asking them highly detailed questions about job status, money supply and more. It is founder <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>'s contention that the consumer still drives the economy, and that the consumer can not do so without a job and income and confidence. More and more he has found these in the Heartland. And more. The improvement in the Heartland economy, he says, is attributable mainly to small, entrepreneurial companies employing fewer than 200 workers. It is a finding, he suggests, that indicates a new, different, more vigorous Heartland. For the two weeks that ended March 7, he found that 22.1 percent of workers there were employed by companies with payrolls of more than 200, but that 31.7 percent were self-employed or worked in companies of 10 or fewer workers. He says that finding is significant. `` These companies are finding their goods more competitive. Especially among small entrepreneurial companies, there is an increased willingness to expand into foreign markets,'' he says. It is because of such successes that <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>'s consumer confidence index has now risen to 66 percent, `` in the boom area.'' It means two things: 1. That two out of every three households nationwide has experienced either income gains or no loss in income over the past six months. 2. That two of three households are either positive or neutral about expectations for income, employment and business conditions. Based on these findings, <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> has scoffed at forecasts of a recession to follow the Oct. 19 stock market crash. In fact, he has raised his outlook for growth in the gross national product, though he sees some signs of inflation to come. Smart companies, he observes, have been capitalizing on the split economy. Some are his clients, and if they have acted on his analysis, he says, they have been able to place the proper inventories in proper geographical areas. Politicians might not be as wise. `` Not one of the presidential contenders has taken advantage of it yet,'' he says. But no matter who wins, he suggests they pay attention to small business. Although the growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is the result of strength among small companies, he says, `` it is the GMs and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Steels who have the time and the money to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the favors they believe they need.'' But the jobs, especially those in the <ORGANIZATION> Heartland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, are coming from small companies. The workers know it. And he suggests the politicians better begin learning it.

 What do <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> have in common? They have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements. Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s highest prize. Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The latest casualties are directors <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, whose movie `` Broadcast News'' was nominated though he was n't, and <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> who was left out in the cold with his `` Empire of the Sun.'' Although `` Broadcast News'' won seven major nominations, including best picture and three acting categories, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch. Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored `` Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> did better in 1984 when his `` Terms of Endearment'' took the lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director. <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year, none of them major and none for director. Two years ago, `` The Color Purple'' received 11 nominations but not for him as director. The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year. `` I'm floored by this,'' <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> said upon receiving his DGA award. `` This is the last thing I expected to happen. ... If some of you are making a statement _ thank God _ I thank you for that.'' Why the <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> slight? Some observers cite the fact that only 257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history -LRB- `` Jaws,'' `` E.T.,'' `` Raiders of the Lost Ark'' -RRB-. The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> with the <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> award for `` consistently high quality of production.'' There was no mention of the fact that <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> is primarily a director, not a producer. The Thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who were overlooked for individual awards. The recipients have included <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMille </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON>. The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy's conscience <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of `` The Circus'' and again at the 44th awards for `` the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubitsch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevalier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gish </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON> are others who have received honorary awards. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> once remarked that he never expected to win an Academy Award. `` I'd have to blacken my teeth first,'' he quipped, alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums and downtrodden characters. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> also had a lighthearted comment on why he failed to win an Oscar: `` I suppose it was a matter of carelessness.'' The overlooking of classic films and the industry's most talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute. For example, `` Citizen Kane,'' which customarily places No. 1 on polls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 for best picture -LRB- there were 10 nominees in those days -RRB-, for <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' performance, direction and co-scripting with <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiewicz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Toland </PERSON>'s camera work, plus art direction, sound, music and editing. The only Oscar for `` Citizen Kane'' was for the script. `` How Green Was My Valley'' was named best picture. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s classic comedy, `` Some Like It Hot,'' failed to be nominated as best picture, as did <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s `` Modern Times,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>' `` Red River'' and <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>.'' Oh, well. Oscar might use <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s final line from `` Some Like It Hot'': `` Nobody's perfect.''

<HEAD>OSCAR COUNTDOWN: A Statuette Is Born</HEAD>
<HEAD>Real Star of Glittering Awards Has Down-to-Earth Beginnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The origins of the Oscar, a golden symbol of artistic triumph, are more down to earth than many of the glitzy stars who take home the greatly cherished statuette. Far from the studios, sun and sea of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, is a cluster of brick buildings in a residential-industrial neighborhood of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Under a cloak of security, this is where the trophy manufacturer R.S. <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> creates the Academy Award prize. Winning the Oscar contract may not compare with winning the Oscar itself. However, it was a coup for <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> seven years ago and remains a source of company pride. The statuettes used to be made by <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, at a small manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, some 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. With 300 employees, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> makes about 95 percent of the most prestigious awards in the country, including the television industry's Emmys, advertising's <ORGANIZATION> Clios </ORGANIZATION>, the Super Bowl trophy and the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> awards. But <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> tops them all. Most people do n't know the names of awards in other fields, much less what they look like, said <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Estka </PERSON>, who handles the Oscar account for <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` Oscar, you know,'' she said. Each model of the muscular knight, who holds a sword and stands impassively on a reel of film, is hand cast from a single steel mold. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> was designed by <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, then head of the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> studio's art department. He sketched the prototype on a table cloth in 1927. Sculptor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> transformed the sketch into the coveted statuette. The trophy was named <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> by longtime <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON>, who took one look at the statuette and declared that it reminded her of her Uncle Oscar, <PERSON> Estka </PERSON> said. The design has remained unchanged since 1927, and the mold, which was turned over to <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> with the contract, is kept in a vault. Neither <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, whose members' votes decide the winners, would reveal the price tag on Oscar. `` I like to say that they are worth a million dollars to the people who receive them,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, founder and chief executive officer of the trophy company. `` Once you have got an Oscar _ you've made it.'' `` If we say it only costs a certain amount to make, what does that do to the image?'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockstill </PERSON>, the Academy historian who will hand the Oscars to presenters at the 60th annual awards presentation on April 11. `` It is the most famous award and the most prestigious. It thrusts a person into the limelight and brings additional cash into their pockets.'' The Oscar's value as a symbol far exceeds the cost of the pewter form and electroplating of copper, nickel, silver and gold, <PERSON> Estka </PERSON> said. However, from 1943-47, because of war rationing, the statuettes were made of plaster. They were later replaced. Early each year, nine or 10 <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> employees set aside the work of the moment such as Little League trophies or bowling prizes to make the Oscars. Each 13 -LCB- - inch, 8 -LCB- - pound statuette takes about five man hours to craft, <PERSON> Estka </PERSON> The awards are handcrafted in the 100,000 square-foot facility with cinderblock walls whose concrete floors often are shrewn with metal shavings. The academy usually needs about 100 Oscars, but this year's order was for 150 because of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> is celebrating its 60th anniversary, <PERSON> Estka </PERSON> said The Oscars are locked in a separate room each night. As each statuette is finished, it is packed in plastic foam. When all are ready, they're put in a sealed truck for the trip to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have an elaborate secret route, but only a few people actually know when they leave or how they go to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, president of the company. Once in a secret <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> warehouse, the Oscars wait in muffled silence for the night they make dreams come true.

<TEXT>
 In the Tang Dynasty 1,000 years ago, boatmen carried rice and supplies to fight the northern barbarians. Today, boatmen on barges still pass through <PERSON> Huaian </PERSON>, but now they carry coal and bricks to keep <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s great metropolises humming. Life goes on, changing but always the same along the world's longest man-made waterway, the 1,000-mile Grand Canal, which <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhua </PERSON>, a local official, describes `` as great a feat as the Great Wall. In <LOCATION> Huaian </LOCATION>, a 1,600-year-old town in coastal <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province, the canal remains the lifeline. Huaian is a bumpy, four-hour drive from the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION> and has no railway. `` We have looked to the water in developing our land,'' said the local radio station director, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruoyuan </PERSON>. Every day about 1,200 barges, some in convoys of as many as 10, pass through the town's two locks, where they are lowered or raised about 10 feet. Along the shore, a sea of men in green and blue jackets load and unload the coal, grain, vegetables, oil, roof tile, cotton, lumber and gravel that traverse the 220-mile <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> stretch from the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the south to the city of <LOCATION> Xuzhou </LOCATION> in the north. The lucky ones have donkeys, but for most a strong back and sturdy shoulders are crucial. People strapped to harnesses tug at carts and wagons. On one bridge, a unique pulley system helps them up an incline. Bicycles weave around bridge-side stalls that sell cabbage, oranges, soft drinks and sugar cane. Children gather around to watch an elderly couple puff oats with a hand bellows that fires a blackened iron pressure vessel. Fishermen come by with cormorants perched on bicycle handlebars, taking the black seabirds to catch fish for them. Work on the canal began in the 6th century B.C. But the early 7th century Emperor <PERSON> Yangdi </PERSON> built the main sections, from the western capital of <LOCATION> Luoyang </LOCATION> eastward and the north-south channel linking <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modern-day capital. Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been mobilized for the project. Upon its completion, the emperor sailed its length at the head of a flotilla extending in close file for 60 miles. During the Tang Dynasty -LRB- 618-907 -RRB-, what served as the ministry of transport was in <LOCATION> Huaian </LOCATION>, and the city had a population of 200,000, double its current number, town official <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> said. The canal fell into disrepair after the <ORGANIZATION> Tang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynasty </ORGANIZATION>, but the <PERSON> Kublai </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> rebuilt it in the 13th century. The Communist government, after coming to power in 1949, has built an extensive irrigation and flood control system to make life easier for the people of this waterlogged, impoverished area. The town fathers also hope <PERSON> Huaian </PERSON>'s rich historical heritage will draw tourists. It was the home to <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, the Han dynasty -LRB- 206 B.C.-220 A.D. -RRB- general; <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chengen </PERSON>, writer of `` Journey to the West,'' the classic of the Ming Dynasty -LRB- 1368-1644 -RRB-, and the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. One small temple along the canal has a statue in memory of the `` washerwoman,'' an upright woman who helped Gen. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> when he was a poor boy and later refused a reward of 1,000 taels of silver. Near that temple, outside their one-room brick homes with upswept tile roofs, the washerwomen of today are still down at the canal, hard at work.

 The school board president in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, disagreed strongly with a recent board vote that outlawed paddling. `` I went to a school where we were spanked when we misbehaved. It did n't damage us,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketchens </PERSON>. `` It did n't teach us that physical violence is the only response.'' Many educators around the nation concur. And yet teachers and administrators increasingly look to alternative ways of controlling unruly students: counseling, suspensions and restrictions on special privileges. They cite lawsuits over allegedly abusive corporal punishment and research indicating that minority and poor students are paddled disproportionately. Spanking has been prohibited in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Movements are afoot in at least 15 more states to try to outlaw corporal punishment. And, as in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, many localities have banned spanking _ among them, the school districts of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> child psychologist <PERSON> Adah </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, who has spent the last decade in an anti-paddling crusade, said it's been difficult to persuade state legislators to support anti-spanking bills because they get mixed signals Teachers do n't like to be told how to run their classrooms, said <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, founder of End Violence Against the <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They vote for the status quo. If paddles are in use, teachers will vote in favor of them. We have found that all over,'' she said. `` But if they've never had corporal punishment, as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, they do n't miss it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is on record as opposing corporal punishment in schools, but its position is not binding on the various state chapters. Religious educators also are of two minds. Some favor banning corporal punishment, saying violence begets violence. Others cite <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s biblical admonition: `` Spare the rod, spoil the child.'' Fundamentalist schools lobbied to be exempted from a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> anti-spanking bill that's supported by Roman Catholic schools. `` Corporal punishment is too risky,'' said Sister <PERSON> Dorita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wotiska </PERSON>, superintendent of the Diocese of Lansing Roman Catholic schools. `` When you hit a child out of anger, the chances of hurting a child is beyond what you know.'' But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanaman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, said spanking `` gets results. Why tie everyone's hands because of the possibility that something might happen on the ten-thousandth time? The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> has estimated public school children are swatted about 1.3 million times a year. But the figures do n't differentiate between a tap with a hand and paddling that raises welts and do not show the frequency of physical injury or emotional damage. The Education Department's biannual survey of 20 percent of the nation's school districts, from which the figures were derived, also showed wide racial and regional fluctuations: children were more likely to be physically punished in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and black children were paddled at a higher rate than whites. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1977 that corporal punishment did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but the justices may take another look at the issue. The high court is considering whether to hear arguments on an appeal from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case. The parents of <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> contend the 9-year-old's constitutional rights were violated when she was paddled hard enough to require medical treatment. They say she was hit on two occasions, first as punishment for hitting a boy who kicked her and later for saying she saw a teacher kiss a student's father. <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> said her research shows that educators get used to using the paddle, then employ it for lesser and lesser offenses. `` There's a lot of sadism,'' she said. `` Children are hit for academic matters, like not finishing their homework. They're hit for coming in a little late.'' In Jackson Hole, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, a sixth-grader was spanked with a wooden paddle by his teacher and about 19 classmates. The offense: getting a grade of 79 percent on a math test. A lawsuit later was settled for more than $ 20,000. In a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> case, the parents of a seventh-grader say they're preparing to sue over the paddling administered to their son and the rest of his class. The reason: one classmate reported his math book missing and no one owned up to the theft. The parents blame the paddling for the seizures their son has suffered since. Those are n't isolated cases, according to <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Study of Corporal Punishment at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Teachers have legally beaten children severely enough to leave welts, lacerations and fractured bones,'' he said, adding that he has documented hundreds of cases. Children have sometimes suffered nerve damage and in rare cases have even died after being required to do exhausting exercises, he said. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> said corporal punishment can inflict on children a version of post-traumatic stress disorder, the psychological damage associated with war veterans. The people who teach teachers-to-be say they emphasize discipline techniques that do n't rely on the threat of pain. `` Most behavior problems can be prevented,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Book </PERSON>. `` Those people who engage in corporal punishment do n't have other ideas in their head on how to cope with kids' misbehavior.'' She urges teachers to give youngsters reasons to behave _ for instance, by setting up contracts in which they agree to give up certain privileges if they misbehave. Sister <PERSON> Wotiska </PERSON>'s technique for stopping misbehavior is a well-directed stare _ `` an evil eye,'' she called it. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> said it's concerned that paddlings may be racially motivated `` Corporal punishment is used most frequently on poor, minority students,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> <PERSON> First </PERSON>, director of the Boston-based advocacy group, which analyzed data from the federal government's most recent school survey Black students made up 16 percent of the nation's school enrollment and accounted for 28 percent of the episodes of corporal punishment, according to the analysis. In individual state analyses, the group found similar discrepancies. For instance, in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, where black students constitute 4 percent of enrollment, they accounted for 13 percent of the episodes of physical punishment. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, 10 percent enrollment, 73 percent punishment rate; in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, 8 and 39 percent; in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 14 and 26 percent; in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 17 and 25 percent; in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, 25 and 35 percent. The National Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> supports efforts to ban corporal punishment in schools. Also on the record as supporting anti-spanking efforts are the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Peru's `President of Hope' in Trouble at Midterm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the youthful <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> took office as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s `` president of hope'' in July 1985, his energetic policies won applause from a country besieged for decades by economic and governmental failures. But midway through his five-year term, the 38-year-old populist has been battered by unrelenting poverty, a leftist insurgency and growing social chaos. In some eyes, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s honeymoon ended in 1986 when he gave government forces a free hand to quell prison riots in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, and more than 250 leftist guerrilla inmates were slain in a bloodbath. Most of <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s support in the middle and upper classes has ebbed since this past July, when he accused Peruvian banks of exploitation and announced plans to nationalize them. Current economic woes have further frayed <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s backing even among the working class and poor, toward whom most of his policies have been directed and from whom he commands his largest following. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s approval rating has fallen from 96 percent during his first months in office to 44 percent, according to the independent polling firm <ORGANIZATION> Datum </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is just too young. He scares the middle class,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who drives a taxi between jobs as a civil engineer. `` The generals might have to come in and straighten things out again.'' Though most analysts doubt a military coup is likely, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s comment reflects a constant worry among many people recalling military rule from 1968 to 1980 The 6-foot-3 <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> won office by a 2-1 margin with a campaign promising a `` different future.'' `` There was a massive need to bet on someone who could pull <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> out of this crisis,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasara </PERSON>, columnist for <ORGANIZATION> Caretas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news weekly, terming <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s appeal as emotional and lacking in substance. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and his center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, moved with dizzying speed to implement policies he frequently terms `` nationalistic and anti-imperialistic.'' He limited repayments of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, now $ 16.5 billion, to a ceiling of 10 percent of exports. `` The voracious appetites of imperialists will not be satisfied with the hunger of the people,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. He used the money owed foreign banks to finance an economic reactivation program that cut inflation to 63 percent and catapulted the country from its deepest depression this century. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> led <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with 8.5 percent and 6.7 percent economic growth in 1986 and 1987. The new chief executive took steps to root out police corruption, decentralize government, boost the fight against cocaine traffickers, gain more control over the military and reduce human rights violations in the anti-insurgency campaign. His reputation as a `` bad boy'' of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> grew as he nationalized a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, banned foreign companies from remitting profits to parent firms abroad, drew closer trade links with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and embraced <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, while condemning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I am going to speak until <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unites and defeats the imperialism of the rich nations,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in one of his frequent volleys against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European foreign policy, which he blames for keeping <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` dependent and on its knees.'' Such talk has eroded much of <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s foreign support. His foes accuse him of being a demagogue, impetuous in making decisions and insincere about keeping promises. Government officials and supporters acknowledge that <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has made serious political and economic errors. But they say the problems are being corrected and recent fence-mending efforts reflect a new presidential maturity. The bank takeover polarized the nation and awoke a powerful center-right coalition. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> went ahead, nevertheless, with the nationalization plan but only one of the 10 banks affected now is under government control because of legal challenges by owners of the others. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, however, has proposed amendments softening the nationalization plan in an effort to lessen the strident opposition to it. In the meantime, many foreign companies have cut back on operations or left the country, prompting the government to revise policies to attract more foreign investment. Spurred by heavy government spending, inflation is expected to rocket to a record 300 percent this year. The country is virtually out of dollar reserves due to falling exports and a cutoff in loans by foreign lenders. With the economy pitching toward a recession, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in early March announced a `` war economy,'' with steep price increases, and appealed to rival political parties to help find solutions. The response, however, has been lukewarm.

 <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' has become the best thing since Post Office walls for law enforcement officials, who say the innovative show has led to the capture of three long-sought fugitives. `` This show is just what the fugitive does n't want,'' said <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Tombs </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who acts as bureau liaison with the Sunday evening program. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' produced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of the proximity to federal police agencies, is a unique mix of dramatization, documentary, news, public service and interactive television. The show uses actors and sometimes actual victims to dramatize crimes, filming when possible on sites where the incidents occurred. The show uses film and still photos of the real fugitives and sends camera teams out to cover stakeouts. And it makes direct appeals for people to get involved in the chase with a 20-line toll-free number, 800-CRIME88. A dozen law enforcement officers, whose expenses are paid by the show, are assigned by their agencies each week to monitor the calls _ sometimes as many as 1,600 _ that follow each broadcast. `` We do n't have anything else that can get the message across the nation in prime time. This is the only thing we have other than Post Office walls which are not that effective,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pederson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. Law enforcement officials credit the show and viewer response for the capture of at least three fugitives, including: _ <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who was wanted for questioning in the February 1987 slaying of 21-year-old beauty queen <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Winlett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carmichael </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the death of 19-year-old <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a convicted rapist in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who escaped from the prison where he had been serving six life terms for burning to death a young couple and their 1-year-old child in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> because the man had witnessed him stealing tires `` We're making a smaller place for these guys to hide,'' said the show's host, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, whose 6-year-old son was kidnapped and killed in 1981. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> directs eight child-protection centers around the country and has become a widely recognized lobbyist for laws protecting children. The unsolved murder of his son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, was the subject of two television movies. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he agreed to do the show only if it would meet high journalistic standards, avoid gratuitous violence and allow him control over his scripts. `` So far <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has kept their word,'' he said. `` The violence on this show is off the evening news. This is not a nightmare turned into a TV show; this is the nightmare of reality.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, the show's producer, said it tries to be meticulous in the details it presents about criminals and clearly identifies dramatizations so tipsters wo n't send police after the actors it uses. He said he is also exploring ways to show less dramatic crimes such as telephone fraud. `` I do n't want to get the reputation for doing only flamboyant, flashy stories,'' <PERSON> Linder </PERSON> said. `` The last thing we want is to be perceived as is Adam 12 or Movie of the Week.'' And, he said, there are no plans to offer rewards for capturing criminals, because he does n't want it to start looking like a game show. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' is aired on Fox-owned stations in seven major cities covering about one-fourth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> TV viewers. With its success in catching criminals and attracting viewers, several independent stations have begun to pick it up. Although the show now is taped about two hours before air time, plans call for the show to be broadcast live. One of the most recent captures attributed the show came earlier this month on a tip from an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> woman who told the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff she recognized <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> from an episode on `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' The tipster did n't know where <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was but also told the sheriff about a call she received from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> about a man named <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>. She apparently connected the call with <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> sheriff sent <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s fingerprints to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> where `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' is not aired, and on Tuesday police discovered <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> were one. <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Telles </PERSON> said the TV show provided deputies with 170 tips. `` I think this is going to put some fear into somebody,'' she said. `` It's a wonderful tool for us.'' Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the convicted rapist, hurriedly moved out of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area apartment where he had been living for several weeks. Police, who had been staking out the apartment, said he fled because he saw the dramatization of his brutal 1983 attack on a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area woman on TV that night. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was arrested four days later. `` The show helped flush him out,'' said Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattioli </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a classic example of a cooperative effort between ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted' and police.'' The program's first success came with its first episode, which had actually been filmed eight months before it was shown last Feb. 7. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> appeared the following week to thank viewers who called the show with information about <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a prison escapee who had been serving six life terms. <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> said that before the tips started pouring in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had no idea that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was living on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with a job as coordinator for a homeless shelter, where residents praised him as a `` sweet guy,'' someone who would help anyone in trouble. Other fugitives profiled on the show include members of a Jamaican hit squad sought in a drug-related massacre of five people in a suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Pops'' <PERSON> Pegram </PERSON>, 72-year-old bank robber who has blazed a 40-year trail of crime across several states.

 Fifty-seven tractor-trailers backed up to a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, loading dock earlier this month to collect their quarry _ six billion `` E'' stamps that had been salted away in a limestone cave for the next increase in postal rates. It was one step in the complex process of raising postal rates that began March 4, when the independent Postal Rate Commission recommended a sweeping series of rate increases, including a 25-cent first-class stamp. The rate increase takes effect April 3. Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> knew there would not be enough time to print new stamps to meet the nation's 100 million-a-day stamp appetite. So he turned to the `` E'' stamps that had been stored in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for more than a year. The stamps have no denomination _ when they were printed, no one knew just how large a rate increase would be enacted. `` We printed six billion. It takes about 13.6 billion stamps to make a rate change. Six billion stamps probably will last us around 45 to 60 days ... in that period of time we can print enough with denominations to get the next six billion stamps out there and replenish the inventory,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said in an interview. `` If we waited to get the rate change -LRB- to start printing stamps -RRB- ... there would be pockets of shortages throughout the country,'' he said. It took four days to finish loading the leased tractor-trailers, which fanned out across the nation delivering the stamps to sectional postal centers for distribution to local post offices. Last Wednesday, the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> board of governors put its formal seal of approval on the new rates, the special stamps went on sale across the nation. While the public will likely take most notice of the new `` E'' stamps, it takes no less than 45 different postal items to get through a rate change, according to <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>. There are the six billion 25-cent stamps to follow the E stamps, plus millions of 1 - and 3-cent stamps that will be needed to make up the new rates for people using up old stamps There's postal stationery _ envelopes and postal cards bearing the new rates _ plus new stamps bearing the 45-cent international rate and stamps with the new bulk rates, non-profit rates, Express Mail rates, official mail rates for government use and even special `` E'' envelopes to mail Savings Bonds. And for each type of stamp, more than one form is printed _ for example `` E'' stamps will come in coils, booklets and sheets; there will be three different booklets of the current 25-cent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> stamp, new booklets of a 25-cent pheasant stamp and other new items, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. To print the stamps needed for the changeover, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engraving </ORGANIZATION> and Printing used 915,000 pounds of ink and 4,680 tons of paper, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. He was n't sure how much glue was used. `` I do n't think people realize,'' how many stamps it takes, he said, commenting that many people ask why the undenominated stamps are used during changeovers. If all the new stamps required were stacked one on top of another _ the thin way _ he said, the pile would be 571 miles tall. Of course stacking them the thin way makes the smallest possible pile, and <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> had statistics with much more impressive illustrations. Many people buy stamps in rolls of 100, he said. If all the rolls needed for the changeover were stretched out, they would go around the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice at the equator, with a strip 5,255 miles long leftover. The other popular sales method is the booklet, he noted, with the consumer seeing only a little folder a few inches long. `` If we laid out all the stamp booklets we are producing they would stretch 10,623 miles, or a round trip between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, so that's why we think we have enough booklets,'' he said. Indeed, the last time rates changed, booklets proved to be the major problem, he said, with supplies never able to keep up with demand. This time he is determined to have enough. In addition, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said, postal and business forms have to be converted to the new rates, decals changed in vending machines, rate charts replaced, new software produced for computer mail terminals and postal scales changed. In addition to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Note </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has contracted to print some new stamp booklets to help in the changeover. Then comes the problem of getting the new stamps into the hands of the public _ at a time when budget problems imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have forced a curtailment of hours at many offices. To help, Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has ordered offices to extend their hours during the next two weeks. In addition flyers will be sent to homes to encourage purchase of stamps by mail. Plus, telephone stamp sales have also been extended nationwide. Callers can use credit cards to buy stamps by calling 1-800-STAMP24. There is a $ 2 service charge. Officials do n't expect people to be happy paying more, but <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> says he hopes at least for fewer complaints about the appearance of the `` E'' stamps. Past undenominated stamps have been rather plain stamps with the head of an eagle. The E stamp has a colorful space-based image of the Earth because, <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> says, `` over the years we have been besieged by the public with requests for pretty stamps.'' `` There's another thing we have to consider as we change rates, especially on the ordinary issues. We have to make them discernably different ... because our clerks have gotten used to seeing'' certain stamps. For example he cited the popular flag stamps. There will be a new flag stamp at the 25-cent rate, but the design will be changed enough to make it easy for clerks to be sure the correct stamp is being used. In 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a commemorative stamp honoring <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> architect <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON> at the 18-cent rate, and then reissued the same stamp at 20 cents when rates changed. `` It was n't a good idea and we do n't plan to repeat it,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said of the confusion. With all this effort, when will they start thinking about the next change and planning an `` F'' stamp? `` Well, we'll probably start looking at that in the near future, at least from the design standpoint,'' he said. But that does n't mean a new rate increase is being considered, he cautioned. `` We do n't look so much at the next rate case, quite frankly, as we look at what might happen between rate cases. `` Theoretically, you could have a requirement for a substitute stamp in several fashions, for example if we did n't have the printing capabilities for stamps for some reason, we would have stamps to tide us over. Or if we had a lawsuit that would change the rates suddenly on us, either higher or lower.''

<HEAD>The Fevered Cultural Temperature of Thatcher's Britain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, a leading British playwright, has remarked that when Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to office nearly nine years ago, the usually vibrant, challenging British theater fell silent. `` A lot of writers stopped writing because they did n't know how to deal with her arrival,'' said the author of `` Plenty'' and other works. `` Now people are really beginning to get to grips.'' Today, secure in her third term of office, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s imprint on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is indelible _ nowhere more so than in the arts, where disaffection is being turned into the stuff of provocative films and plays The topicality itself is nothing new, as `` angry young playwrights'' such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesker </PERSON> and such filmmakers as <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisz </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> were demonstrating 30 years ago. But no post-war government, Conservative or Labor, has come under such concerted artistic attack as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s, and few serious works today fail to address themselves somehow to the phenomenon of Thatcherism, most often from an angry, left-wing viewpoint Emasculated politically by the march of Thatcherite capitalism, the left has dug in on stage and screen to attack her bourgeois, pro-business values. So sustained is the onslaught that a backlash is being felt from artists who ordinarily would stay out of the political crossfire. `` I'd much rather have a frank disinterest in culture than a phony and deliberate one,'' novelist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackroyd </PERSON> recently said. `` And I find the patronizing snobbery of those who despise Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her supporters very unpleasant indeed.'' In a recent Sunday Times article, right-wing historian <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the growing tendency was `` to run down Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, to assume that capitalism is parasitism, that the established order in this country is imperialist, racist, profiteering.'' Earlier, critic <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> had asked in the conservative Sunday Telegraph: `` Why is there so much stage Left?'' and yearned for a play to counter the `` vicious denigration of poor old Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'' which he saw proliferating in theater. Many of the works have a common message: Under Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is becoming a greedy society, heartless to the poor, hostile to free speech, in thrall equally to nuclear weapons and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Works both new and old are being mobilized against Thatcherism. In <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s `` A Small Family Business,'' the upstanding hero falls into a spiral of corruption in which vanishing paper clips become a metaphor for vanishing morals. <PERSON> Olwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wymark </PERSON> has adapted <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Zola </PERSON>'s 1880 novel `` Nana'' for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage because, she says, it matches her sense of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today. Both dramatists acknowledge the anti-Thatcherite message. `` I could n't have written that play 10 years ago,'' <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>, 48, said in an interview. `` The disease -LRB- of greed -RRB- much more deeply permeates the society now than it once did.'' The American-born <PERSON> Wymark </PERSON> says she chose `` Nana'' because `` the book is about the kind of tendencies <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has been able to nail to the mast. ... I feel very strongly that the urge towards greed is being fostered, the sense of communal responsibility is drying up.'' <PERSON> Hanif </PERSON> <PERSON> Kureishi </PERSON>, the Anglo-Pakistani screenwriter of two low-budget hit movies, `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> Get Laid'' and `` My Beautiful Laundrette,'' says he and director <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frears </PERSON> want their movies `` to shoot bullets at Thatcherism and everything it stands for.'' `` Because things are so terrible in this country, we have to be able to look at what's going on and discuss it publicly,'' <PERSON> Kureishi </PERSON> said in an interview. `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>'' opens with images of a riot-torn, rubbish-strewn <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the voice of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> promising to tackle the problems of the inner cities. Other works share <PERSON> Kureishi </PERSON>'s view: <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>'s `` Wetherby'' and <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarman </PERSON>'s `` The Last of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'' on screen; <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alrawi </PERSON>'s `` A Colder Climate'' and <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Adshead </PERSON>'s `` Thatcher's Women'' on stage On television, various drama series consistently portray the government as authoritarian, secrecy-obsessed, even murderous. `` Spitting Image,'' a satirical program, uses rubber dolls to portray Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her ministers as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. More benignly, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> in `` Paradise Postponed'' has pointed up the irony of post-war <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>: the traditional working-class vote has swung to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the self-made grocer's daughter, because she, rather than the ideological left, embodies blue-collar aspirations. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, a committed Laborite, gently mourns the loss of an older, dreamier, more compassionate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Other playwrights, such as <PERSON> Caryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> in `` Serious Money'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchant </PERSON> in `` Speculators,'' vilify the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district as a nest of greed, fraud and raw ambition. Director <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Edzard </PERSON>'s six-hour film version of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' novel `` Little Dorrit'' draws parallels between the Victorian virtues and vices and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Its juxtaposition of obscene wealth and tragic destitution, she says, makes it `` the <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> novel very much closest to today.'' However, some critics feel the point is being stretched. Reviewing <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darke </PERSON>'s 1983 play `` The Crimes of <LOCATION> Vautrin </LOCATION>,'' which used an <PERSON> Honore </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzac </PERSON> work to indict a society glutted by materialism, critic <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> complained in The Observer newspaper: `` It is a gray day when <PERSON> Balzac </PERSON> can be bleakly molded to symbolize the dread face of Thatcherite <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> does have defenders, powerful figures in the arts such as painter <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and novelists <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Amis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> who argue that the resentment is largely intellectual snobbery toward her bourgeois background. Historian Stone wonders why there are not more films such as `` A Room With a View'' and `` Chariots of Fire'' which extol traditional British virtues. But <PERSON> Hanif </PERSON> <PERSON> Kureishi </PERSON> feels the truths of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today take precedence over golden-hued images of its past: `` There are actually so few films that show life in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at all -LRB- that -RRB- we have to make films about life as it is. There are so many stories to be told, and we've got to get on with it.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar moved lower against most major foreign currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today in the absence of market-moving news. Gold prices also fell. Dealers said the dollar was unlikely to move much during the day, since no important economic news was expected. Officials delayed until next week today's planned release of West German January trade data, seen by some in the market as an indicator of the near-term trend for the mark. Dealers said that although the West German trade figures are not very important for interpreting dollar trends, they are relevant for investors trading on cross-rates between the mark and major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. Dealers said the market was expected to focus again on the pound-mark rate. They said the pound is likely to test the key 3.1000-mark level again today after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> reportedly intervened late Thursday to push the pound below that level. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.56 yen to a closing 125.74. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.84 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.6792 West German marks, down from 1.6800; 1.3884 Swiss francs, down from 1.3885; 5.7000 French francs, down from 5.7120; 1.8860 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980; 1,242.75 Italian lire, down from 1,246.95; 1.2415 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2426 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.8422, compared with $ 1.8435 late Thursday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 452.65 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 452. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 451.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 451.80, down from $ 452 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.32 an ounce to close at $ 454.08. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.68 a troy ounce, up from late Thursday's $ 6.61.

<TEXT>
 The dollar closed slightly lower against the Japanese yen on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market today, while stock prices shed more than 150 points following declines in both currency and stock markets overseas. The dollar opened at 125.68 yen, down 0.62 yen from its Thursday closing, and closed the week at 125.74 yen. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank reportedly purchased an estimated $ 200-300 million during the morning to prop up the sagging currency. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> does not comment on its monetary policies, including market intervention. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which lost 113.95 points Thursday, closed today at 25,626.71, down 154.57 points, or 0.59 percent. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market `` was discouraged largely by an overnight decline in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market,'' said <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, a stock researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage firm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 43.77 points to close at 2,023.87 points Thursday. <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON> said stock prices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> kept rising `` at a rapid pace'' in recent weeks and just `` took a little respite the past two days.'' Commenting on foreign exchange transactions, a dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were `` no major negative market-affecting factors domestically'' to explain the dollar decline. She said there still was a chance for `` the yen's further appreciation against the dollar'' and predicted the dollar would hover at a range between 123.00-127 .00 yen next week

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former thrift executive has been charged with falsifying documents, making illegal campaign contributions and procuring prostitutes for members of the institution's board of directors. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, one-time vice president of the former <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was charged Thursday in a felony information filed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with conspiracy to violate federal bank and bribery law. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 40, arranged for sexual favors for <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> officers and directors at a three-day 1985 board meeting in <LOCATION> Solana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in an apparent attempt to win favor with the board. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate in a continuing investigation of the thrift. He could be sentenced to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Vernon Savings was closed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. In the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest bailout ever, the agency committed $ 1.3 billion to help reopen the institution as a new thrift, <ORGANIZATION> Montfort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, former owner of Vernon Savings, is fighting an <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit charging him and other former officers with `` looting'' the institution. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> falsified documentation justifying $ 100,000 in payments to a consultant, and along with others created false board minutes on renewal and extension of some commercial real estate loans, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. He also was accused of conspiring with a Vernon official to make $ 5,400 in illegal state and federal campaign contributions on the understanding that he would be reimbursed through false expense vouchers submitted to <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>. Contributions went to such politicians as Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> and former Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, prosecutors said.

 A scientist who 14 years ago helped discover that some chemicals destroy the earth's protective ozone layer says he's elated that the nation's largest manufacturer of them plans to eventually end production. The announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could encourage other companies to follow suit, says <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, professor of atmospheric chemistry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. `` I think <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has had more intimate contact with the science than some of the other companies,'' and thus more credibility, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I am elated by it.'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>'s delight was matched by environmentalists and their allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who used words they rarely use when talking about large corporations _ things like `` This letter is a wonderful surprise,'' as Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., put it `` This is a sterling example of corporate environmental leadership'' added <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudek </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s pledge notably omitted any deadline for compliance. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, environmental manager in <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Freon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> division, said the length of a changeover to other chemicals could not yet be determined. He said it will depend on the outcome of work still under way testing substitutes, but it should be known `` certainly within five years.'' It was <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> who, in 1974 with <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, first mapped the chemical route _ then just a theory _ by which the long-lived chlorofluorocarbon or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds rise high into the stratosphere, are broken up by ultraviolet rays and liberate chlorine which destroys the ozone that normally blocks ultraviolet rays from reaching the ground. That ultraviolet causes skin cancer, and there is some evidence from lab animal tests that it can suppress the immune system. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that each 1 percent decline in ozone overhead means an increase of 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent in the most common forms of skin cancer. Research is under way to determine the effect, if any, of increased ultraviolet on tiny forms of marine life. Some have predicted that they, too, could be hurt by increased ultraviolet. The Rowland-Molina mechanism, scientists say, is almost certainly what causes the annual 50 percent drop in ozone over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> continent each spring, and what has caused a 2.3 percent decline in ozone over mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986. The mid-latitude decline was announced last week by a panel of more than 100 scientists who worked under the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for 17 months in the most thorough examination ever undertaken of ozone. This report was `` important new information,'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s chairman, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>, wrote members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Thus, `` additional actions should be taken for long-term protection of the ozone layer,'' a switch from <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>'s March 4 letter to the senators saying further action was not needed. Thirty-one nations last fall signed a treaty in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> calling for a 50 percent reduction in CFC production by 1998. <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>'s letter said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> was encouraging other manufacturers and <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> users to join in `` an orderly transition to the total phaseout'' of the compounds `` We also plan to urge all nations to treat the new scientific information seriously, accelerate ratification of the Montreal Protocol and then immediately initiate the protocol's assessment process to consider further global limitations on the emission of CFCs,'' he wrote. CFCs have been valued because they are non-toxic and non-flammable. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> and other companies have rushed work on substitutes in recent years, and the company already has announced alternative products for plastic foam blowing agents and cleaning solvents for electronics parts. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> and others are researching new compounds for a third major use of CFCs, as refrigeration fluids. The fourth major use, as aerosol propellants, was banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978, though it is still common abroad. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerosols now are powered by hydrocarbon compounds which slightly enhance the production of ozone at ground level, where it is a pollutant. A <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> briefing paper said some jobs might be impossible to perform with substitutes at a price anyone would pay, but it did not give specifics. More than 2,000 workers in <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> plants in seven countries make about 25 percent of some 2.3 billion pounds of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds consumed each year. The company said it sells $ 600 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> products annually, about 2 percent of its sales revenue. <PERSON> Steed </PERSON> said the company hopes that `` over the long term'' jobs making replacement compounds would offset lost <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> jobs.

 Stock prices fell Friday following the release of disappointing British trade figures.

 The stock market headed lower today in a carryover of selling from Thursday's sharp drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .83 to 2,023.04 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 418 up, 575 down and 444 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.23 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed signs of steadying today. Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit. But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since late last year. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 59 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> raised its offer for the company from $ 56 a share to $ 60 a share.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows, Inflation Steady at 3.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed 8 percent in February, while the country's annual inflation rate was unchanged at 3.3 percent, the government said Friday. The trade gap totaled 1.32 billion pounds, or $ 2.43 billion, far above market expectations of an 875 million-pound gap, but economists warned that new customs rules adopted at the beginning of the year continued to distort the figures. The pound, British government bonds and British stocks nonetheless tumbled on the news. Even if the pound shows renewed strength in the near term, analysts said the trade report makes a further cut in interest rates remote. In January, the merchandise trade deficit came to a revised 1.44 billion pounds, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had a current account deficit, which includes invisible trade such as financial services, of 720 million pounds last month, narrower than a revised January deficit of 844 million pounds but wider than market expectations of a gap around 270 million pounds. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s retail price index rose 0.4 percent in February from January and was up 3.3 percent from February 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> said in its inflation report. In January, the index was unchanged from the previous month and also up 3.3 percent from a year earlier. The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100.0, stood at 103.7 in February, up from 103.3 in January, and up from 100.4 in February 1987. The department said the rise in the index between January and February was mainly the result of higher prices for fresh and vegetables, and with the end of the winter sales period, prices for clothing and other goods were higher. Prices were lower for petroleum products and motor vehicles.

 Police have only bits and pieces of disintegrated bank checks to go on as they try to crack a dissolving paper caper that has hit at least two states and cost banks nearly $ 70,000. The checks, treated with a chemical that makes them disintegrate three or four hours after being deposited, have turned up at five or six banks in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area and two in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, police said Thursday. `` The one I've got in front of me looks like a handful of ashes,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s financial crimes division A check clearinghouse said it has warned 142 banks to be on the lookout for the dissolving checks, which may have an unusual odor and feel oily. The checks, drawn on personal accounts at banks in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, have been reported in about 12 incidents, <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON> said. Authorities are also checking a report of a possible dissolving check in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. In most cases, someone opens a new account at a bank with a small amount of money and later make a large deposit with a dissolving check. Then the money is withdrawn before the bank learns the big check was bogus. The check's decomposition leaves little for evidence. Police believe more than one person is involved, but have no suspects because of the dissolving evidence, <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON> said. `` So far nobody's been harmed by it. The only clue we've got is we've talked to the tellers. One teller says that the check felt oily, another said it had a funny aroma,'' the captain said. On Thursday, <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON>'s office received copies of five checks for a total of $ 20,000 drawn on a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank and deposited at a bank in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> `` They're in bits and pieces,'' he said. The scam has cost banks about $ 70,000, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which clears checks for 142 members, sent out a memo March 9 warning of the dissolving checks, said Vice President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. The association first learned of the checks from <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which has been hit by at least three disintegrating checks since Feb. 16, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police learned of the dissolving checks about two weeks ago, <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON> said. `` What happened was two checks showed up in one of our downtown banks and they literally dissolved,'' he said. Northern learned on March 4 that two other checks for more than $ 8,000 dissolved after being processed by <ORGANIZATION> Jewel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which offers banking services for some customers. Officers from <PERSON> Jewel </PERSON> told the bank that a worker saw one of the checks start `` to sweat and deteriorate from its borders.'' The worker tried to prevent further disintegration by putting the check in a paper envelope, but the envelope also began to dissolve, investigators said. Northern Trust declined to comment. `` We are not at liberty to discuss customer accounts,'' said a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s gross national product grew 12 percent last year, down from a growth rate of 12.3 percent in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. The GNP totaled $ 118.6 billion last year, compared $ 98.3 billion in 1986, according to the central bank's preliminary estimate. The central bank had projected a growth rate of 12.2 percent for 1987, based on economic growth in the first three quarters of the year. Bank officails said exports, the mainstay in the Korean ecnomy, accounted for 46.1 percent of the GNP last year when Korean exports soared to a record $ 47.2 billion, up 36.2 percent from a year earlier. The sharp rise in dollar value of the GNP, which measures the nation's output of goods and services, was attributed partly to the revaluation last year of the Korean won against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. The won rose 8.7 percent last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, struggling to recover from heavy losses caused by a string of box-office bombs, says it will close down its five regional film-distribution offices, eliminating 28 jobs, or about 15 percent of its 200 workers. Among the movies that performed poorly at the box office for DEG were `` Taipan,'' `` Million Dollar Mystery,'' `` Weeds'' and `` Date With an Angel.'' The company said Thursday its future sales would be handled out of its corporate office but that the company would `` continue to explore various distribution alternatives.'' Those alternatives could include contracting with another film company to handle <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurentiis </PERSON>' production. Currently, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurentiis </PERSON> has seven films, most of them completed except for various amounts of post-production work. That is down from nine films in 1987.

<HEAD>Griffin Seeks Talks With Trump in Resorts Fight; SEC Begins Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s investment company says it is seeking to meet with rival bidder <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in their battle over hotel-casino operator <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> at this time has no plans to further increase his $ 295 million offer, spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and an attorney for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also disclosed separately that the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has begun looking into alleged violations of securities law in the Resorts fight. In another development, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> announced that the largest holder of Resorts' Class A common stock had withdrawn its support for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 22-a-share offer and asked a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court to reject it. The court must act on the offer because it was made as part of a proposed settlement of shareholder suits alleging that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s initial offer of $ 15 a share undervalued the company <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikellis </PERSON> disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation in a letter to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court, linking it to `` very substantial gyrations in the marketplace'' for Resorts stock. It attributed those stock price movements to statements by <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and an ally that `` have had a manipulative effect.'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> also acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had begun gathering information in the probe but indicated that it was limited to allegations of violations by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, including the failure to promptly disclose a new and higher appraisal for Resorts properties in making his $ 22-a-share offer. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> last week made an offer of $ 35 a share, or $ 225 million, for all of the company's stock _ its 5.7 million Class A shares, which carry one vote each, and its 752,000 Class B shares, which carry 100 votes each. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns 95 percent of the Class B stock, giving him control over 88 percent of the company's voting strength. This week, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> boosted his offer to $ 295 million. Except for a proviso that Class A shareholders receive an unspecified premium over the $ 35 offer, Resorts' directors would be able to apportion the $ 70 million increase as they see fit. That was widely seen as a vehicle to shunt most of the money to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. `` We are prepared to sit down with Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and the Resorts board to discuss obtaining a superior bid for the public stockholders and to satisfy the needs of all parties,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said the allusion to a `` superior bid'' referred to one that is better than the $ 22-a-share bid that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has made <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has no plans at this time to again increase his offer. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has repeatedly said he would not sell his stock _ a condition required by the <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> bid. Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, said Thursday that the New York-based developer has n't changed that stance. As a result of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s objection, Resorts' board has twice refused to pursue the offer on grounds it is moot. The shareholder who defected from the settlement agreement with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Tweedy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 8.6 percent of Resorts' Class A stock. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, has hotel-casino operations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices opened steady to mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans opened off more than a penny a bushel due to fairly heavy farmer selling after Thursday's sharp gains, analysts said. But prices came back quickly and were narrowly mixed within minutes of the opening bell. Soybean prices also were pressured by ideas that the threat of weather damage to the nearly ripe <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop has passed, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` You have n't had moisture there since mid-February,'' <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said. `` But the perception in the market is that whatever damage will be done to the crop by the hot, dry weather has already been done.'' He said wheat futures were slightly lower due to slackening export demand; corn was slightly higher on a lack of farmer selling. In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.06 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent higher with May at $ 2.07 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 1.69 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with May at $ 6.49 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .03 cent to .23 cent higher with April at 74.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with March at 82.45 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .50 cent higher with April at 46.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .32 cent higher with May at 57.00 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Thursday; pork futures were mostly higher.

West Point-Pepperell dropped $ 1.50 a share to $ 33.12 -LCB-. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> does not plan to respond to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>'s new offer `` until we have some information on which to base a response,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said some <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> shareholders had sued the company for rejecting <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier cash buyout offer of $ 56 a share, or about $ 867 million, but declined to elaborate. Eager to capture <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as part of an ambitious expansion plan, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said it would raise its latest offer to $ 64 a share if <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> accepted its proposal and signed a definitive merger agreement by April 5. The merger agreement would have to be similar to the accord that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> signed with Odyssey, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> said. Odyssey's offer is subject to a majority of the shares being tendered and the necessary financing being obtained. `` We've been absolutely frustrated by the -LRB- <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> -RRB- board,'' <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said his company was willing to sweeten its bid to $ 64 a share `` if the board would only cooperate with us.'' Asked whether <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> would consider raising its offer above the conditional $ 64 a share, <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said, `` I would n't preclude it. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> also sought to soothe potential antitrust concerns raised by a possible merger of the two textile giants. The company said that if it acquired <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, it would sell half of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about $ 170 million. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> said it has signed a definitive agreement for the sale with <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Bidd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a textile manufacturer. The comapny also said <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> had an option to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' automotive and residential carpeting business for $ 120 million Bidding for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> began shortly after it fielded a leveraged buyout offer several weeks ago from a group led by its own senior management, including Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ a fifth-generation member of the family that founded the company in 1813. The management group initially offered $ 43 a share and later sweetened its bid to $ 55 a share in cash and securities. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed money repaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> has indicated previously that an acquisition of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would fit with its strategy of focusing on consumer products. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>'s brands include Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Burberrys </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, one of the nation's biggest textile makers, produces home fashion textiles such as sheets, towels and carpets under the brand names <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>. The company also makes automotive and industrial products.

<HEAD>Is It a Bull, a Bear Or an Ostrich?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bull charges with a ferocious, head-down gallop that spikes victims and flings them in the air. A bear attacks by clawing and stomping enemies into the ground. The beasts evolved into the symbols for good times and bad in the stock market, the bull for charging forward in a buying spree and the bear for selling at any excuse. They are ingrained in the securities vocabulary. But amid one of Wall Street's most uncertain times, questions are arising over these terms. Some analysts say the market's erratic behavior since the October crash suggests it might be time to scrap the conventional animal analogies in favor of others `` I would rather have eagles and groundhogs,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But seriously, how about ostrich? The market is wearing blinders to what the economic problems are out there, hiding its head in the sand.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hofstra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and financial author who has written extensively about the stock market, says he believes the October break was an aberration in the bull market that began in 1982. Now that the market is neither bullish or bearish, he says, `` I call it a horse market. Just horsing around.'' Most strategists who routinely use bullish or bearish to describe the outlook do n't know the origin of the terms. Historians never have documented precisely who invented them. `` Throughout my travels I've never seen anything that says, ` Aha, this is where it came from,''' said <PERSON> Yale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, a veteran analyst who publishes the Stock Trader's Almanac. `` I've looked constantly, and nobody seems to know.'' A common hypothesis is that the symbols evolved during the 1800s in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON> says. `` The theory most people seem to accept is that a bull, when it goes after you, tries to push you on its horns and lift you up,'' <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON> observed. `` The bear crushes you down.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Medbery </PERSON>, a 19th century stockbroker who wrote a work titled `` Men and Mysteries of Wall Street,'' was one of the first to explain the terms in print. If you bought stock cheaply for future delivery in the hope prices would rise, you were a bull, he wrote. If you sold stock for future delivery in the hope prices would fall, you were a bear. The official history book of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> suggests the analogy's roots may date back earlier to the proverb, `` To sell the bear's skin before one has caught the bear.'' The book also mentions natural history as a possible explanation. `` If a bear finds anything, whether it be a turkey on a roost or a man on a tree, he lifts its paw and pulls it down,'' it explains. `` The bull, on the contrary, lowers its head only to give men and things a decided upward tendency.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> helped institutionalize the bull and bear analogies early this century, when it commissioned a sculpture depicting the beasts locked in combat, with neither taking the advantage. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's biggest investment houses, uses the bull on its logo. Animal behaviorists say that generally, the bull and bear analogies to the stock market are appropriate. `` Bears are pretty tough animals,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, manager of animal collections for the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Zoo. `` People take them as being lethargic and easy-going. But if they're disturbed, for whatever reason, they run you right down. It's like the 8:15 from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> coming into Grand Central.'' <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, professor of animal science at <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says bulls can have unpredictable behavior patterns but usually are territorial and ornery. `` That's probably one of the main reasons the analogy to the stock market is made,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` On a practical basis though, the bulls we use in the -LRB- husbandry -RRB- industry are selected for good behavior. In other words, if somebody has an aggressive bull, it probably winds up as hamburger.''

 The stock market lost more ground today in a carryover of selling from Thursday's sharp drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 43.77 on Thursday, dropped 14.92 to 2,008.95 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 475 up, 821 down and 495 unchanged. After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed signs of steadying today. Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit. But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since late last year. That left the fous of activity on numerous stocks involved in takeover news and speculation. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 ~ to 46 ~ amid widespread but unconfirmed rumors that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was readying a bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Sabine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> for $ 24 a share, gained 3 -RRB- to 23 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, rumored as a possible buyout candidate, picked up 2 ~ to 27 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 59 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> raised its offer for the company from $ 56 a share to $ 60 a share.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates and bond prices were holding steady in early trading today, following Thursday's volatile session that ended on a mixed note. By midday, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond slipped 1-32 point, or about 30 cents per $ 1,000 face amount, and yielded 8.72 percent, unchanged from late Thursday. The bellwether issue had closed 1-32 point lower in the previous session after losing as much as -LCB- point, or $ 5, earlier in the day. In the absence of any market-moving economic news, some bond traders were looking at the currency and oil markets, often an indicator on where inflation might be heading. A stable dollar was said to be adding a positive tone to shorter-maturing securities while a slight increase in oil prices has hurt some longer-maturing bonds a bit. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments and intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1-16 point higher while 20-year issues were down 1-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.01 to 111.82. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood at 1,169.54, up 0.31. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged in light trading, according to the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.63 to 281.73 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were down 3 basis points to 5.78 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.03 percent and one-year bills were off 2 basis points at 6.38 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 6 | percent, unchanged from late Thursday

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in its quest for <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said today it will move to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> its legal battle challenging the appliance and garden equipment maker's agreement to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said its board will meet next week to review bids from <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>. GE increased its tender offer for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> on Monday to $ 507 million, topping <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 470 million merger agreement with <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>. The GE tender offer amounts to $ 54 a share; <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer amounts to $ 50 a share for the <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, Ga.-based company. A federal judge here denied <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s request to move a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where GE filed two suits challenging the Roper-Whirlpool combination. `` It was simply a matter of whether it would be consolidated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said today it will withdraw the federal court actions it filed in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> in and refile them in the <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> court, <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> said from GE headquarters in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> will be inconvenienced by litigating in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will be inconvenienced by litigating in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> said in a written order issued Thursday. But in ordering the case to be heard in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> noted that many of the main witnesses are in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has not said whether it will top <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s latest bid. `` We do n't have a comment on that at this point,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said today. Analysts have said that merging with <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> would move <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> ahead of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> as the country's top appliance maker. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s suit charged that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s initial $ 45-a-share offer for <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, made on March 6, was an attempt to sabotage a Whirlpool-Roper merger agreement announced in February in which <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 37.50 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> later sweetened its bid to $ 50 a share, and <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s board recommended shareholders accept the offer In its lawsuits, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> claimed both <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> failed to adequately disclose terms of their merger agreement under <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> laws. The suit also claims <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> failed to publicly disclose <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s prior interest in acquiring <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> and accuses the <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> board of concealing from shareholders that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>, wanted to buy the company.

 Share prices closed lower Friday but finished well above their worst levels of the day reached after the release of disappointing British trade figures for February. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 14.8 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,767.9. The index moved down as much as 23.3 points on the trade news but then recovered gradually through the afternoon as trading volume slackened considerably. Volume was light at 412.5 million shares, down from 535.3 million on Thursday. Shares traded narrowly in the morning but then plunged when the government reported at 11:30 a.m. local time that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s February merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 1.3 billion pounds, about $ 2.4 billion, from 1.4 billion pounds in January The current account deficit, which includes invisible trade like financial services, narrowed to 720 million pounds, or $ 1.3 billion, from 844 million pounds, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite the narrowings, both deficits were much larger than the markets had expected. The sharp drop attracted a few bargain hunters. Share prices recovered further on the back of markups by market makers after Wall Street opened, apparently in no mood to reenact Thursday's sharp sell-off But afternoon trading volume slowed to a trickle ahead of the weekend. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was 13.3 points lower at 1,408.3 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 9.35 points to close at 999.76.

<HEAD>Who Are Big `Muni' Buyers? Don't Look At Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has clearly broken up the cozy relationship between the nation's commerical banks and the municipal bond market. Historically one of the biggest players in that market, banks have dumped more than $ 51 billion of their municipal bond holdings in the last two years due to changes in the tax law, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group of bond dealers. The report, released this past week by the <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> and based on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> data, showed that individual investors were the leading buyers of municipal bonds for the third consecutive year in 1987, either through the purchase of individual bonds, unit investment trusts or tax-exempt mutual and money market funds. The report noted that households owned 39 percent of the $ 720.5 million outstanding issues last year, up from 33.6 percent in 1986 and 36.5 percent in the previous year. Banks came in second with a 25 percent holding, down from 29 percent in 1986 and 35.1 percent in 1985. Their holdings peaked in 1971 with 51.2 percent. Property and casualty insurance companies owned 13.1 percent; mutual funds, 9.8 percent; and money market funds, 8.5 percent. The dramatic decline in bank holdings came as a result of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which removed incentives for bank portfolios to invest in municipal bonds, or `` munis'' as they're known on Wall Street. Banks had been able to deduct from their income taxes 80 percent of the cost of holding these tax-exempt bonds, but the tax law eliminated the deduction except on state and local issues totaling $ 10 million or less a year. The changes have had a mixed effect on the market so far, analysts and traders said. `` From an issuers point of view ... you're entering the market realizing that except in very unusual circumstances banks wo n't be one of your purchasers, so you're heavily dependent on individual purchases who face an entirely different set of incentives than do banks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. In the recent past, issuers and banks have had a cozy relationship. As an example, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> notes that around tax time when some individual investors sold bonds to raise cash to pay their taxes, banks would eagerly snap them up, keeping prices and yields stable. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, says it's not surprising that since the tax law most smaller issues have been doing better than the bigger ones which dominate the market. Because banks are still actively buying them, bonds from the smallest of issues are more liquid, meaning they could be traded in a short period of time with relatively small price fluctuations, <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON> said. That price stability means lower yields, reducing borrowing expenses for the small issuers but raising them for the bigger ones. Analysts note that volatility in the muni market is likely to continue through 1989, when insurance companies will see their tax incentives wiped out as a result of the overhaul of the tax system.

The new limits will range from 15 index points to 25 index points depending on the settlement price of the lead-month <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 futures contract on the last business day of the preceding month, the exchange said in a statement to its members. Price limits effectively halt trading of a futures contract whenever the price of the contract moves above or below the specified amount. Investors use stock-index futures to hedge against losses in the stock market by betting on the price movement of the stocks that make up the index. S & amp; P 500 futures account for more than 80 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock-index futures trades. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the limits will result in better coordination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets, a key recommendation of the presidential commission that investigated the stock market crash. A one-point move in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index is roughly equivalent to an eight-point move in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials. Some analysts had criticized the 30-point limit on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 futures _ equivalent to about 240 points on the Dow _ as being too high to curtail all but the most violent price swings. A 15-point limit will take effect Monday because the June contract settled Feb. 29 at 268.75 points, within the low-end range of 0 to 275 points. The limit would rise to 20 points if the June contract settled above 275 points on the last trading day of March, or to 25 points if the June contract closed above 325 points. The June contract settled at 264.10 points on Thursday.

 The stock market came under more selling pressure today, extending Thursday's sharp drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 43.77 on Thursday, dropped 23.70 to 2,000.17 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 434 up, 969 down and 479 unchanged. After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed signs of steadying today. Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit. But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks.

<HEAD>Most Companies Relocate Close to Home, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most companies stay close to home when they relocate their headquarters, according to a national survey to be released Monday. The survey published by <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business real estate firm based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, showed that 85 percent of the companies that relocated their headquarters during the past five years moved to a similar type of location, while 62 percent relocated in the same community. Only 7 percent of the relocating companies changed states, the survey indicated. The findings are based on interviews with top executives at 400 organizations, including publicly and privately held corporations, partnerships, non-profit companies and government agencies. All the organizations polled have 50 or more employees at their headquarters and have relocated in the past five years. While the suburbs of large cities rank first as a preferred location for head offices with 36 percent, the survey also suggested a growing tendency for relocating in the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON> said. The survey showed that 28 percent of the relocating companies consider big cities the best type of location. `` The survey disputes the widespread impression of a sudden wave of headquarters relocations and a mass exodus from the nation's largest cities,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirante </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the real estate company `` Only a handful of organizations relocate across state lines,'' <PERSON> Mirante </PERSON> added. He said such moves recently as <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are the exceptions rather than the rule. The need for more space was the most compelling reason for relocating, according to the survey. Other reasons were a more favorable company image, lower occupancy costs, a better quality of life for employees, better access to markets, customers or clients, and a major change in the company's strategic direction. None of those factors, however, were considered crucial by more than 24 percent, the survey showed.

<HEAD>Trillions of Dollars Up for Grabs as Savings System Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than $ 2 trillion in Japanese savings accounts loses its tax-free status next week, and executives from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> investment firms to foreign manufacturers are dreaming of tapping into the treasure trove. The April 1 change was prompted by complaints from allies that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> needs to spur domestic consumption as a way to recycle some of its $ 82.7 billion annual trade surplus. The hope is the new 20 percent tax on interest will encourage Japanese to save less and spend more. But many experts do not foresee that happening. The system of tax-free individual accounts _ known as `` maryu'' _ was set up after World War II to provide a reserve of capital to finance the rebuilding of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy. Through it, the average Japanese family had built a nest egg worth the equivalent of $ 82,000 by last year. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemo </PERSON>, a broker for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Da </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, estimates such accounts now hold a total of 300 trillion yen _ or about $ 2.3 trillion. Banks are touting new savings plans to hold onto this treasure, while securities companies are trying to lure it away. Foreign countries hope to get part of it through increased sales of exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But despite the advertising hoopla, <PERSON> Nemo </PERSON> and other financial analysts expect much of the money to remain right where it is for now. `` This is not as spectacular as one might expect,'' <PERSON> Nemo </PERSON> said. He said recent surveys of Japanese housewives, who handle most of the money in the average Japanese family, found they would be willing to pay the new tax and `` leave their nest eggs alone.'' However, he said there is bound to be at least a small percentage unwilling to settle for the low interest that banks pay on such accounts. Some of that money will find new homes, most probably in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s booming stock market. Banks pay only four-tenths of 1 percent interest on a regular savings account and up to about 4 percent for long-term deposits. Under the maryu system, no tax was charged for interest on savings accounts of up to $ 47,500, postal savings accounts of $ 23,800 and installment savings of $ 4,000. In addition, workers were allowed to build tax-free savings accounts of $ 40,000 through their employers. The Japanese are among the industrialized world's biggest savers. The average family in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> saves 16.1 percent of its annual income, compared with 11.6 percent for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 10.1 percent for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 7.8 percent for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 6.6 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Nemo is doubtful the next tax will have much effect on saving. `` The problem is, they already have just about all the televisions, videos, and smart clothes they could want,'' he said. `` And if they ca n't afford to buy homes, where are they going to spend the money?'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, 99 percent of the Japanese own a color television set, refrigerator and washing machine, 98 percent own a vacuum cleaner and nearly 70 percent own a car. With the high housing and land prices, most Japanese can never hope to own their own home, so there is little else to do with the money other than spend it on high-priced cars or travel, invest it in the stock market or put it in a savings account. <PERSON> Takasuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Koneko </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said Japanese are very cautious about where they put their savings because the burden of providing for old age falls on the individual in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He predicted many people would be scared off stock investing because of the worldwide plunge in stock prices last October. <PERSON> Koneko </PERSON> said some of the money probably will go to life insurance, which is still tax-free if a person signs a contract for more than five years. However, he said, many people will not be willing to wait that long for a return on their investment. `` The bottom line is that we have to protect ourselves,'' he said. `` We can not shift our funds. Still, we will have to save. In 20 years, when we get ready to retire, the stock market could be two or three times what it could be now, but it could also be one-half or one-third. `` Even with the end of the maryu system, our money has to be kept where it is safe.''

 Corn futures prices closed higher while wheat and soybeans finished slightly lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn turned in the best performance but most of the buying was speculative in the absence of fresh fundamental news, an analyst said. Soybeans retreated in line with soybean meal.

At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.05 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.09 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent higher with May at $ 1.68 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents lower with May at $ 6.48 -LCB- a bushel.

 The arrival of spring has brought signs of recovery to the toy industry following 1987's dismal performance. Stores are selling more toys and manufacturers are getting more orders. But toymakers know the fickle tastes of young customers can take a promising product and overnight turn it into a dud. So there is an air of caution in this highly volatile business, although the early trend is positive. `` It's a very good retail environment for the first time in several years,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a toy industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Us </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest toy store chain, President <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricken </PERSON> said more customers are in the stores and sales are up `` quite strongly'' over last year `` The indications are that it's a better start for the year than most people anticipated,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Boise </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest toymaker. Good consumer demand usually translates into more orders for manufacturers, and that has heartened the big toy companies, most of whom finished 1987 in the red because product lines failed, sales fell off and costs were too high. Toys that were big sellers at Christmas have remained popular in 1988. Among them are <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and other video games, <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s Pictionary board game, <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION>'s Fun With Food, <ORGANIZATION> Kenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION>' Real Ghostbusters action game and <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s Pee Wee Herman talking doll The popularity of such products _ known as carryover toys in the business _ contrasts with the events of a year ago, when toys that had been best sellers at Christmas 1986 fizzled. Another positive sign is that the success of the current best-sellers is becoming contagious. `` They spark people to come into the store, and they buy other things,'' <PERSON> Ricken </PERSON> of Toys R Us said. `` There is a lot of impulse buying.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Anguilla </PERSON>, editor of the trade publication <ORGANIZATION> Toy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hobby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying, `` The key is, bring people into the stores.'' Several years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s Trivial Pursuit and Cabbage Patch Kids were luring consumers in droves, but Pictionary and <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> are today's top draws, <LOCATION> Anguilla </LOCATION> said. But despite the early trends, manufacturers and the people who track their fortunes are taking a wait-and-see approach for the remainder of 1988. `` It's a little too early to predict a strong year,'' said <LOCATION> Anguilla </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>'s orders are running ahead of the company's conservative expectations, but <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> warned, `` Orders are not necessarily a good indication of how the year might go, because they're cancelable anytime up to delivery.'' The analysts also caution that after the disappointments of 1987, it's easy to show for companies to show an improvement in sales. `` They're just going from a disaster to a more normal operating environment,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think they are doing better, but I do n't see anything great happening,'' he said. Caution also was the watchword when the industry unveiled its new products last month at its annual trade show, Toy Fair. Burned by the failure of lines such as expensive high-tech dolls, companies showed fewer new toys and leaned toward smaller, less expensive ideas. The early returns indicate the strategy is working. <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is getting strong orders for Starting Lineup, a series of sports figures intended to sell under $ 5 apiece, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON>, a company spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION>'s orders are well above 1987 levels, <PERSON> Meek </PERSON> said. The company markets a top-selling video game, Sega, but all of its divisions are showing improvement, he said. Industry watchers say another company doing much better is <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galoob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s. <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>, which lost money on high-tech items in 1987, is focusing on less risky ideas such as plastic charms that contain cosmetics and stationery for girls, tiny dolls and small, transformable military figures for boys. Companies, some of which have laid off workers, also continue to look for ways to cut expenses. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> announced a restructuring in its Canadian operations, including 60 layoffs. Such moves will help a company's bottom line, and form a hedge against heavy losses should sales drop off again. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> predicted for the toymakers this year, `` They'll have some modest profits, but no one's setting the world on fire.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> auctioned off $ 4.06 billion in short-term bills on Friday with an average yield of 6.20 percent. The so-called cash management bill will mature in 22 days and was issued so the government would have enough money on hand to make tax refund payments during the tax filing season. The last time the government had to resort to such short-term financing was during last year's tax filing season when a 20-day bill had an average yield of 5.75 percent. The discount rate understates the actual return to investors _ 6.31 percent with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,962.10. A total of $ 38.81 billion in bids were received.

<TEXT>
 A South Korean trade delegation signed contracts in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Friday to purchase about 10 million bushels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for about $ 29.3 million, and an official said about 95 percent of his country's corn purchases this year would be from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That would mark a continued rebound of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments, which in 1985 accounted for just 36 percent of the corn purchased by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales mainly reflected an aggressive export drive by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> earlier this decade to compete for a growing share of world sales, said economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said the resurgence of corn sales to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a result of reduced Chinese sales because of growing domestic consumption. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, meantime, is stepping up imports of feed grains as it expands its livestock industry, and has increased corn consumption from 3 million metric tons in 1985 to about 5 million metric tons this year, said Chan-Kung Park, head of the trade mission and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The delegation signed contracts Friday to buy 150,000 metric tons, or about 6 million bushels of corn, from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> and to buy another 50,000 metric tons, or about 2 million bushels, each from <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A metric ton is approximately 2,205 pounds After subtracting the cost of transporting the grain to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> paid an average of about $ 1.85 a bushel for the grain, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Those purchases, when added to contracts signed in neighboring <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, brought sales to the trade mission to 550,000 metric tons. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said that so far this year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had bought more than 2.25 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and that most of the remainder of its 1988 purchases would be from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He estimated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would account for 95 percent of the corn bought by his country in 1988. `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is purchasing as much as possible from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said through an interpreter. He said that with the decline in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in the past three years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn is priced competitively on world markets with grain from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> sources and he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural policy has been very successful since 1984. In the early 1980s, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also bought more than 90 percent of its corn from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> became a major competitor. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is the nation's leading corn producing state.

<HEAD>Pickens, Eastern Unions Reportedly Consider Texas Air Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday declined comment on press reports that investor <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is considering helping unions acquire the company. The Wall Street Journal reported in Friday's editions that <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> met recently with representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' unions to propose a plan to take over <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of Miami-based Eastern <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest airline holding company with about 20 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> laid out one strategy whereby his personal investment company, <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, would assist the unions in seeking a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported. `` The longstanding policy of the company is never to comment on rumor or speculation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, also declined comment. Under <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' plan, about $ 1 billion of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees' pension fund money would be used as leverage to fund an offer for the company, the newspaper said Under the arrangement, the unions would negotiate wage concessions in return for a financial stake in the company, the Journal said. If the plan succeeded, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> would receive a fee, and would not participate in the management of the company, the newspaper reported. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has about $ 5 billion in long-term debt, and Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has control of the company's voting power. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and a few close associates own a special class of stock which carries voting rights 10 times those of regular common stock. Unidentified participants in the recent discussions between <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions told the Journal they believed between 75 percent and 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares would have to be tendered in order to dilute <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s voting control to a minority position.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will not raise its $ 6.53 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but is demanding a fair opportunity to compete with <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. to buy the retailer, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> `` Campeau is not increasing its price,'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> as saying in a statement to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board Thursday. `` It believes its price is already too high.'' `` This does not mean that you can give <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> a chance to jigger its bid or take any other action with respect to <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, without giving <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> a fair opportunity to respond,'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> as saying. The Federated filing was made public Friday. The Cincinnati-based Federated, operator of more than 650 stores nationwide with total 1987 sales of $ 11.1 billion, said Thursday it would discuss <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer with the Toronto-based developer and talk with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> about a possible sweetening of <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> $ 6.3 billion bid <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> management has already approved a merger agreement with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, said its board would meet by Wednesday, and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> and his counterpart at <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, both would be allowed to speak at the session. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said there is no guarantee the negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> will result in an improved offer. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday raised its two-step, all-cash offer for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> to an aggregate of approximately $ 73 a share from $ 68 a share, or $ 6.18 billion. Under the new offer, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 82 each for 70.5 million Federated shares and $ 37 for the remainder of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.5 million outstanding shares in a subsequent merger. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also extended the expiration of its offer to midnight EST April 4, when <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s offer is scheduled to expire. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also proposed to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board an alternate friendly merger under which it would pay $ 73 a share for 70.5 million shares in a tender offer and $ 73 for the remaining shares following the merger. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has proposed that a Campeau-Federated merger be structured along lines similar to a merger agreement between the retailer and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> is offering $ 77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, for a total of $ 5.4 billion. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> would exchange shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities for the remainder of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.5 million outstanding shares. Analysts value the <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> offer at $ 6.3 billion. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s divisions include <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s department stores; <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main Street and Children's Place specialty stores. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> also has delayed putting into effect, until at least March 30, a `` poison pill'' amendment to the company's shareholder rights plan that allows shareholders to buy new shares at a steep discount. It is designed to make an unwanted takeover more expensive. It is not clear if <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> could apply the pill to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> but not to <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>. Some analysts believe the outcome of the takeover fight may turn on that issue, and that a court might ultimately decide whether <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> can take such a step.

<HEAD>Subsidized Wheat Sales of 475,000 Tons to Soviets Get Green Light</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federally subsidized sales of 475,000 metric tons of hard red winter wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been indicated by five private exporters, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to pay in-kind bonuses to the exporters at an average value of $ 21.95 a ton to ship the wheat to the Soviets in May. The subsidy payments were being made under the Export Enhancement Program, which provides grain companies and others with government-owned crops as bonuses to stimulate overseas sales of American commodities. Since last April, total subsidized sales of wheat to the Soviets have totaled amore than 10.8 million tons. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, identified those receiving the bonuses and the amounts of grain involved as <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Artfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons. The sales left 525,000 tons still left for the Soviets to purchase under a 2 million-ton offer made by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Jan. 29. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also made the Soviets an additional one million-ton offer on Saturday. The two countries are preparing to negotiate a new long-term grain agreement to replace the one that expires Sept. 30. It calls for the Soviets to buy 9 million metric tons a year of which 4 million must be wheat and 4 million corn. The rest may then purchasing the remainder in wheat, corn, soybeans or soybean meal, with every ton of beans or meal counting as two tons of grain. Wheat sales to the Soviets slumped badly in 1986 despite the agreement but picked up against last year as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave that country the green light for purchases under the subsidy program.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>, who helped oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> make his corporate raids for the past decade, said Friday he plans to leave the firm to start a consulting business that may compete with <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>, 38, said he will leave <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> at the end of May to move to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` It was really more of a case of leaving <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> than leaving <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>. `` Ten years in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> is enough,'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said. `` It's a significant sacrifice to live in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>,'' which he likened to `` a large truck stop.'' He said he told <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> last year that he would be leaving. `` My third child _ my son, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> _ is graduating from high school in May,'' he said. `` And I told <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> nine months ago, when that happens, I would be leaving.'' He said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said that he `` hated to see a great team split up, but he understood.'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON>, who helped <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> launch takover attempts against <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to offer other oil and gas interests his experience through a private consulting firm. `` I think the expertise that I've developed through the years with <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, I could take out now and advise others,'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said. `` I think I can generate some ideas that would be helpful to other companies.'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> refuted claims that his departure signals discontent with <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s recent failed or aborted takeover efforts. In fact, he said, he expected to be involved in more decisions with <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. `` I hope to do business with <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> and bring him some deals,'' he said. Still, he acknowledged he may be competing with <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> on some ventures. `` Certainly the primary level for expertise I have is in the oil and gas industry,'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has recently branched out into the gold industry and the aerospace space industry. But petroleum has been a very profitable venture for <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and is still very much a viable interest.'' The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> native came to <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' firm from the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office of the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells, where he made $ 30,000 a year as an audit manager. He began at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> as an assistant to a vice president, but rose to the rank of comptroller within two years and ultimately to the presidency of <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. When <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> later became a limited partnership, <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> began as a consultant. <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said he believed <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> would not suffer with his departure. `` I think it will continue doing exactly what it's been doing,'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said. `` We have a great team at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. The other two members of my team have been with me six years and seven years. They'll go forward with the business.'' <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said he did not think he would be replaced at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think they need to,'' he said. `` They are very experienced.''

 Stock prices tumbled for the second straight session Friday, closing out the market's worst week so far in 1988. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 44.92 points to 1,978.95, finishing the week with a net loss of 108.42. That marked the average's biggest weekly decline since it dropped 143.74 points last Nov. 30-Dec. 4 Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in the daily tally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 385 up, 1,156 down and 428 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 163.17 million shares, against 184.91 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index lost 2.42 to 146.58. After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed signs of steadying Friday. Interest rates, which had contributed to the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a bit. But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since late last year. In the absence of any news to explain the market's weakness, brokers said many traders remained fearful that economic and inflationary pressures might soon reach a point where they would prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to begin tightening credit. Since early February, when the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> set strictures on computer program trading in the event of a 50-point move in the Dow, the average has had five separate gains or losses of more than 40 points without ever activating the 50-point `` collar.'' It rose 47.58 on Feb. 10; rose 48.41 on Feb. 29; fell 48.24 on March 10, and then suffered back-to-back losses of 43.77 and 44.92 Thursday and Friday of this week. Point-plus losers among the blue chips Friday included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down 2 -RCB- at 107; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 -RRB- at 40 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 -LRB- at 41 |; <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION>, down 2 -RCB- at 161 -LCB-, and International Paper, down 1 -RRB- at 41 -LCB- About the only stocks attracting any buying interest were issues involved in takeover news and speculation. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 -RCB- to 46 -RCB- amid widespread but unconfirmed rumors that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was readying a bid for the company. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 3 to 88 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Sabine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> for $ 24 a share, gained 3 -RRB- to 23 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, rumored as a possible buyout candidate, picked up 2 | to 26 As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 39.81 billion, or 1.52 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 189.25 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 5.78 to 299.53, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.84 at 258.51. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 3.06 to 372.54. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 294.64, down 2.66.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Tumble As Buying Interest Fades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Platinum futures prices plunged more than $ 10 a troy ounce Friday as the buying interest that had propelled prices sharply higher earlier this week abruptly dried up. On other markets, gold and silver futures also retreated; crude oil prices rose above $ 17 a barrel; stock-index futures fell sharply; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and grains and soybeans were mixed. A five-day rally in the precious metals market skidded to a halt after speculators tried and failed to push prices through key resistance levels, analysts said. Platinum took the hardest hit, settling $ 10.10 to $ 10.80 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in April finishing at $ 503.10 a troy ounce. `` From what I understand there was just no interest in buying it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, director of futures trading for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Usually the tendency is for the floor traders and speculators to go into the weekend and take their profits.'' Inflation fears linked to rising oil prices had supported the precious metals through the week. But even Friday's solid gains in oil prices could not keep the metals from slipping. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 1.00 to $ 1.20 lower with April at $ 453.30 a troy ounce; silver was 7 cents to 7.4 cents lower with March at $ 6.665 a troy ounce. Crude oil rose above the psychologically important $ 17-a-barrel mark for the first time since Feb. 11 on speculation that the five-member pricing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would take substantive action to stabilize prices when it meets the first week in April, analysts said. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 12 cents higher with May at $ 17.03 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent to .47 cent higher with April at 47.78 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .53 cent to .70 cent higher with April at 47.94 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures plunged for the second consecutive session, mirroring sharp downward moves in the Dow Jones industrial average. The contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 6.35 points lower at 257.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said trading activity was mostly technically motivated. `` I think we're in the throes of a good correction,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. `` It's very orderly, very methodical and not what I would call very heavy volume, either.'' Live cattle futures posted new contract highs for April and June delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the bullish mood reflected higher cash prices increasing demand. The higher cash prices for beef parts `` suggest that retailers are coming in fairly strong looking to get their needs ready for after Easter,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They do a lot of hams before Easter, then the week before Easter they start really getting interested in beef again,'' <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> said. Pork futures prices advanced on higher cash prices and indications of slackening supplies, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said. Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .52 cent higher with April at 74.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .52 cent higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; hogs were .18 cent to .67 cent higher with April at 46.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies werre .03 cent lower to .62 cent higher with May at 57.37 cents a pound. Corn futures prices closed higher while wheat and soybeans finished slightly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn turned in the best performance but most of the buying was speculative in the absence of fresh fundamental news, an analyst said. Soybeans retreated in line with soybean meal. The soybean complex also was pressured by ideas that the threat of weather damage to the nearly ripe <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop had passed, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON>, senior grain and oilseed analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Losses in wheat futures were underpinned by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s sale Thursday of 7.2 million bushels of surplus wheat, an unusally large figure for the thrice-weekly auctions in the face of slackening export demand, <PERSON> Loewy </PERSON> said. Wheat settled 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.05 a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.09 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent higher with May at $ 1.68 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 6.48 -LCB- a bushel.

<HEAD>Adams Says Amendment Would Allow U.S. To Get Tough With Airbus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The omnibus trade bill pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will include a provision allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` get tough'' with a European airplane manufacturer which domestic aerospace companies claim receives subsidies and engages in unfair trading practices, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State senator said Friday. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the provision, which he authored, has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators trying to iron out final details of the trade bill. `` This amendment is designed to stop the international consortium supporting <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> from using unfair trading practices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of aerospace companies in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, is the world's second-largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes with about 35 percent of the market. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, has between 55 percent and 60 percent of the market. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said his amendment would expand coverage of existing `` countervailing duty laws'' to include countries such as those supporting Airbus. At present, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies can seek relief from unfair trading practices when their competition is subsidized by just one country, but not when the subsidies are coming from a consortium of foreign countries. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can sucessfully compete with <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, but not if <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> is not playing by the rules and getting huge subsidies from foreign governments,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> officials have consistently denied that the company was receiving government subsidies or engaged in unfair trading practices. The countervailing duty laws allow domestic manufacturers to ask the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to impose a duty equal to the amount of foreign subsidy for a product. `` Adoption of the amendment will help ensure a fair arena for competition between <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` The adoption of this important amendment by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also demonstrates once more for European governments the seriousness with which their subsidies are viewed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said L.W. <PERSON> Clarkson </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, unable to lure <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> into a friendly deal, on Friday boosted its hostile tender offer for the building materials and cement company to $ 1.7 billion. Government officials, meanwhile, lashed out at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for assuming the unusual role of equity partner in the takeover bid, but <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> maintains it is merely acting as a responsible investment banker to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, a long-standing client.

Last weekend, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> sweetened that bid to $ 56 a share, or $ 1.52 billion, which <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> characterized as inadequate. Before going directly to shareholders with its latest $ 60-a-share tender offer, the British construction and building materials company tried to negotiate a friendly deal at the same price with <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> management. In staunchly resisting the overtures, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said it is prepared to go deep into debt to finance a one-time cash payout to its shareholders as a defensive maneuver.

 The dollar closed mixed after moving in jagged fashion Friday amid rumors that central banks stepped in to steady the currency. Gold prices eased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 452.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from Thursday's late bid of $ 453.15 an ounce. Traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> moved to support the dollar as the yen continued its upward climb against the major currencies. The dollar fell to levels against the yen not seen since mid-January. Without the intervention, `` the beating would have been fairly bad'' for the dollar, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Soria </PERSON>, vice president and foreign exchange manager at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. While sentiment is brewing that the narrowing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits might be drawing to a close, traders continued to argue that the dollar's drop is not so much related to fundamentals as it is to the continued strengthening of the Japanese yen. `` There seems to be a very big demand for investors to be into yen,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Dealers are wary that the Japanese will begin to dump their dollar holdings once their fiscal year comes to a close on March 31, `` so the market is beginning to jump the gun'' by selling the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. The dollar mostly weakened in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the pound was the center of attention as it slumped on the heels of a British government report of a disappointing trade deficit for February. The pound was hit by news that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in February to 1.3 billion pounds, or $ 2.4 billion, from 1.4 billion pounds in January. The current account deficit, which includes invisible trade like financial services, was pegged at 720 million pounds, or $ 1.3 billion, from 844 million pounds, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.56 yen to a closing 125.74 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.33 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 125.30 yen, down from 125.575 yen Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.8360 from $ 1.8435 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.84175 to buy one pound, cheaper than Thursday's $ 1.8420. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.6760 West German marks, down from 1.67725; 1.3865 Swiss francs, up from 1.38625; 5.68625 French francs, down from 5.6995; 1,238.50 Italian lire, down from 1,242.50, and 1.24205 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2421. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.6760 West German marks, down from 1.6800; 1.3865 Swiss francs, down from 1.3885; 5.6860 French francs, down from 5.7120; 1.8820 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980; 1,241.00 Italian lire, down from 1,246.95; and 1.2433 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2426. Gold prices eased. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold closed at $ 453.20, a troy ounce, down from $ 454.10 on Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold fell to a late bid price of $ 451.70 a troy ounce from late Thursday's $ 452. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was lower, closing at a bid $ 451.50 compared with $ 452 dollars late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.32 an ounce to close at $ 454.08. Silver closed at $ 6.665 a troy ounce on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, down from $ 6.735 on Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.64 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 6.61

<HEAD>Resorts Seeking $600 Million Financing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, target of rival takeover bids from entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, is trying to line up $ 600 million in high-yield bond financing, mostly to complete its overdue and over-budget Taj Mahal hotel-casino. The financing negotiations were disclosed Friday by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who controls 88 percent of Resorts' voting strength, is the company's chairman and is seeking to buy the rest of its stock and take it private Besides providing money to complete the Taj Mahal, proceeds from the financing would be used for working capital and to reimburse <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for stock-purchase costs if his tender offer succeeds. While terms of the financing are n't complete, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said the arrangement is contingent upon the success of his tender offer for the company and upon <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s guarantee that the Taj Mahal will be finished. If <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s takeover bid fails, the company may seek a smaller amount of financing, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has estimated it will take $ 550 million to complete the sprawling and luxurious Taj Mahal, which would become <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s biggest hotel-casino with 42 floors and 1,250 rooms. Final cost of the project is estimated to be $ 938.5 million, up from an estimated $ 535 million when work on it began four years ago. Resorts has other hotel-casino operations in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns nearly all of the company's 572,000 shares of Class B stock, which carries 100 votes per share. He is offering $ 22 per share to buy the remainder. Besides Class B stock, the company has 5.7 million Class A shares, which have one vote each. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> last week made a rival bid of $ 35 per share, or $ 225 million, for all of Resorts' stock, including that held by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> later increased his offer to $ 295 million, leaving it up to Resorts' board to decide how to apportion the $ 70 million increase between the two classes of stock. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has repeatedly refused to sell his stock and has sued <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> for $ 250 million for allegedly interfering with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s contractual obligations with Resorts <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has sued <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and Resorts' outside directors, claiming among other things that they breached their fiduciary duty by refusing to pursue <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer. Resorts' board said it did n't pursue <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s proposal on grounds that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s rejection had rendered it moot On Thursday, the two sides disclosed the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had begun looking into allegations of securities violations, but they blamed each other's activities for triggering the probe. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> claimed statements and actions by <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and an ally had a `` manipulative effect'' on the market for Resorts' stock. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> contended the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was looking into allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and failure by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to disclose a new and higher appraisal of Resorts' value in making his $ 22-per-share offer. Resorts shares rose 12 -LCB- cents Friday in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading to close at $ 28.87 -LCB-.

 Four applications to build a bullet train linking <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> were submitted Friday after six years of planning for the space-age but still conceptual rail system. Details of the applications are to be revealed Monday in a ceremony with Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and legislative leaders. `` This is a major milestone in this project,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today's deadline will put us one large step along toward putting high-speed rail in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' The commission expects to narrow the list to three semifinalists, after a year's review, and award the franchise in September 1991. Planners hope trains will be running by 1995, the state's 150th birthday. State guidelines mandate the multibillion-dollar project must link <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, but the applicants will determine precise routes, financing agreements and the technology to use. `` The first thing I want to know is, is what they're proposing a real viable plan? Is it a politically do-able deal?'' said <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> developer and attorney <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirschenbaum </PERSON>, one of the seven businessmen on the commission. The team that wins the franchise will be allowed to develop property for rail stations and connecting attractions, a financing plan that mirrors one used by industrialist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagler </PERSON> who built a rail line nearly 100 years ago down <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and eventually to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` Property developed as a way to help finance the system must have some transportation link to the high-speed rail,'' said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>. Theoretically, those development deals will allow the franchisee to recoup its $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion startup costs, while fares will support rail operation and maintenance. Balancing financial arrangements, environmental concerns, growth patterns and evolving technologies, the commission will select the best overall plan _ or reject all of them _ and make a recommendation to the governor and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. Initial fees for applicants are $ 35,000. Several months from now, applicants will have to pay about $ 2,000 per mile, or about $ 600,000, to cover more detailed reviews of their proposals. The four applicants are: _ <ORGANIZATION> TGV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> D.C.-based team backed by the French company <ORGANIZATION> Alsthom </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies the 160 mph TGV trains to the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian manufacturing consortium _ All <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MagnePlane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richey </LOCATION>, which has an agreement to purchase a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> patent for a magnetically driven rail flight system, said President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, a civil engineer and developer The average speed of the train, which still is being developed, is 250 mph, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. _ <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Webster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a 100-year-old, Boston-based international firm <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s proposal is based on the French <ORGANIZATION> ANS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turboliner </ORGANIZATION>, a 150 mph train that can run on existing track. _ <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a 40-member, international team based in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Headed by <ORGANIZATION> Amerifirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company proposes an electrically powered system similar to Swiss, Italian, West German and some American trains already operating.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday rejected a proposal by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> to discuss a merger, saying <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> actually intended to mount a takeover bid. The railroad and financial services company received a letter from <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> on Monday proposing talks concerning a possible negotiated merger. <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>, said the company's board of directors unanimously rejected the proposal. `` It is clear to us that Mr. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>'s letter is merely a salvo in his proposed proxy contest,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> has not even made a pretense of having sought or obtained financing, confirming our view that he is merely attempting to put the company into play.'' <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>'s investment group owns 11.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. The group said Monday it was offering $ 60 cash a share, or about $ 594 million, for the remaining 89 percent. The stock closed Friday at $ 51.62 -LCB- per share, down $ 1.37 -LCB- per share in national trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> said in his letter that he would attempt to place his own slate of directors on the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> board if it rejected or failed to act on his offer by April 4. He also accused the board of having erected obtacles `` designed to entrench itself and to prevent stockholders from realizing a full return on their investment.'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said Friday that `` contrary to Mr. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>'s careless statements impugning, without foundation, the motives of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> directors, every action taken by the directors has been entirely dedicated to the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and its stockholders.'' `` The board, after due review of Mr. <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>'s letter, reaffirmed its confidence in the company's future and its view that now is not the time to sell the company,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. In reaching its conclusion, the company said the board obtained an opinion from its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which reportedly said the <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> proposal was ambiguous and inadequate. The proposal appeared to be an effort to stimulate trading in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> stock or to publicize <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>'s plan to nominate two persons to the company's board of directors, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> said earlier. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>, one of the nominees, said Wednesday the investor group would begin a proxy fight for the two slots. Four of <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s 14 directors will be elected May 3 at the company's annual meeting <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s main holding is <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> railroad, which is the country's 14th-largest line. The company also owns 87.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> DST </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial record keeper based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where it and affiliated operations employ about 2,000 people. For the fiscal year that ended Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 17.7 million, or $ 1.82 a share, on revenue of $ 507.6 million.

<HEAD>Customs Rules Samurai is Truck, Not Car; Seats Added After Import</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday that the tiny <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samurai </ORGANIZATION> sport-utility vehicle will continue to be counted as a truck since it enters the country without back seats, which are added later. <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Samurais are imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as trucks because <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> does n't have a large enough allocation under the Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship them as cars or sport-utility vehicles. `` This decision does n't make any sense when people see how these vehicles are being used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but in this case the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` These are ` trucks' under the law when they enter this country,'' he said. Instead of paying a 2.5 percent car tariff, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> pays a 25 percent truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped without back seats to qualify as trucks. Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at dealerships. Few, if any of the small sport vehicles actually are sold without rear seats. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> sold 81,349 Samurais in this country in 1987 and said it plans to sell 100,000 in 1988. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>'s decision. `` It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the Japanese are shipping seats into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> separately, then installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the -LRB- voluntary export restraints -RRB-,'' he said. `` We do n't like illogical decisions any more than Commissioner <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said Customs soon will seek public comment on the creation of additional criteria that would simplify the classification process. Last year, Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had little interest in helping the Japanese government enforce its export limits, particularly since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government takes in more money when foreign carmakers opt to pay the 25 percent tariff instead of the lower fee. Other Japanese companies following <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s practice include <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the companies said last year. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has safety and fuel economy standards, among other criteria, used to classify a vehicle as a car or truck for those purposes. For example, trucks are not yet subject to the same roof-crush, side-strength and high-mounted brake-light standards as cars. But those criteria are not used by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which instead looks at features such as number of seats to determine a vehicle's apparent purpose when it is imported. The Japanese government voluntarily limits exports of Japanese cars to this country to 2.3 million per year. Under a less-publicized quota that was designed to cover station wagons, which are considered trucks in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Japanese government also limits exports of sport-utility vehicles and minivans shipped to this country to 113,000 to 115,000 a year. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, which gives nearly all its car allocation to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the imported <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, built by <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, also has no sport-utility vehicle allocation. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> it would be forced to close its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealerships if the Samurai were classified as a car. But when that information became public, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> denied it had any intention of closing dealerships and said it instead was aggressively expanding its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealer network.

<HEAD>FCC Votes To Rescind Rate-Setting Freedom For Small Cable
Operators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to rescind the freedom of a small number of cable television systems to set their own rates for basic service. Municipal rate regulation was lifted for more than 90 percent of the country's 7,800 cable TV systems in January 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s rules change, approved 3-0, will subject more systems to regulation by municipal officials, but neither the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> could estimate how many. Both, however, said the number would be small. The Cable Communications Act deregulated the rates for basic service of cable systems in areas that had `` effective competition.'' Cable systems that met this test became free to set their own rates for their basic tier of service, which includes the retransmission of local broadcast TV signals. But a federal appeals court struck down one of the components of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of that term and the agency's vote Thursday was intended to address that decision. Under the new definition, a cable system will be deemed to have competition if all residents in the franchise area receive at least three over-the-air broadcast signals, not necessarily the same three signals. Under the old defective definition, a cable system was found to have competition if any three broadcast signals covered 75 percent of the county where the cable system operated. The <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> said it was disappointed in the decision since there is no evidence that cable systems have abused their freedom to set rates. `` But there appears little we can do about it'' because `` the courts are unlikely to second guess the commission on this matter,'' the trade association said. `` We, therefore, look to the record to be established by the large majority of cable systems which will continue to be deregulated to give us the ammunition to go back at some point in the future and ask the commission to revisit this issue.''

<HEAD>Abboud: Bondholders Should Not Hold Out For Better Terms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The successful rehabilitation of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is hindered by the apparent failure of some debt holders to accept current conditions for tendering their bonds, according to the head of a private group seeking to complete a $ 1.5 billion restructuring of the company. `` Each day of delay costs money,'' said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investor, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> French-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. As of last week, 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 225.8 million in bonds had been tendered, but the restructuring deal requires 90 percent participation by the close of business next Tuesday. `` It's not in their best interest to hang onto the bonds if they're going to crater the deal in the process,'' <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said. Caving into demands for better terms could set a negative precedent for similar transactions in the future, he said. Senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the dollar for their debt, while subordinated debt holders have been offered 35 cents. `` On a liquidation basis, their investment is worth zero,'' <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said, referring to the $ 100 million in subordinated debt. `` Once the preconditions are established, we have to stick to them.'' `` The professionals in the market should understand that -LRB- banking -RRB- is not a regular industry,'' <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said. `` The institutions that are so integral to our financial system should know this.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> is trying to restructure Houston-based First City using $ 970 million in assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 500 million infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group headed by <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> and a spinoff of $ 1.79 billion in book value of poorly performing assets. First City, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company with 59 banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, grew quickly during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $ 1.1 billion loss. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, who become chairman under the federal bailout plan, said he was optimistic a deal could be closed by March 31. Besides a successful tender, First City still needs to renegotiate unfavorable leases. First City shareholders already have voted to support the <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> plan.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will divide up $ 250 million this year in bonuses for salaried employees who contributed to the success of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries in 1987, the company said in its annual report Thursday. A proxy statement in the second week of April will reveal how many people will be awarded executive bonuses by the board of directors' compensation and option committee, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. In 1987, the seven-member committee of directors from outside the company awarded $ 164.3 million in bonuses for 1986 to 5,528 salaried <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. The 1986 bonuses ranged as high as $ 1.3 million for <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, and $ 1.1 million for <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>, then president and now vice-chairman, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. The company does not divulge the amounts of executive bonuses or other compensation except to the five highest-paid executives. Their compensation will be revealed in the April proxy report, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had said in February it was distributing $ 635 million, or about $ 3,700 each, to hourly employees as their share of the company's record $ 4.6 billion in 1987 earnings. The compensation and option committee allocated the $ 250 million for the executive bonuses out of a possible $ 363.9 million under a formula in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholder-approved supplemental compensation plan, the annual report said. <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said the $ 164.3 million awarded last year was out of a possible $ 241.9 million. The annual report, mailed Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 250,000 shareholders and released publicly on Thursday, cited the income of $ 4.6 billion _ highest annual earnings of any company in automotive history _ despite the year's seven percent drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck sales, higher capital spending and increased marketing costs. The report described a `` corporate culture ... based on the understanding that no individual is responsible for designing, engineering, manufacturing, assembling and selling a product.'' The first page of the report was a tribute to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who led the company as president or chairman for nearly 35 years prior to his retirement as chairman in 1979. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> died Sept. 29. `` On all he left his imprint,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said in the memorial tribute.

<HEAD>Proposed Northwest Attendants Contract Would Eliminate Two-Tier
Scale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The proposed contract for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants would eliminate a two-tier wage scale, add $ 75 million to the company's payroll to cover wage and benefit increases and unify work rules, a company official said Thursday. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s chief negotiator in contract talks with <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> Local 2747, said that if ratified by the rank-and-file the proposed contract would take effect June 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1992. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 2747, said the union negotiating committee voted Wednesday night to submit the proposal to the rank-and-file. Union officials have said they expect it to be approved. The proposed contract was reached Tuesday, averting a strike threatened for March 29. The final hurdle to the agreement had been how to treat lower-paid B-scale employees who were to get an $ 800-a-month pay raise by moving to the higher-paid A-scale after their fifth year of service, <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. The union wanted to retain the provision and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> wanted to delay the pay raise until the eighth year. As a compromise, the proposed contract will phase the 65 percent increase in after an employee's seventh year of service. Workers would be paid under a single scale after 12 years with the company, finally unifying scales of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> attendants with those of their counterparts from the former <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The two-tier wage scale issue had intensified since the merger. About a third of the 2,600 former Republic attendants are on the lower pay scale, and the other two-thirds had said they would n't get enough out of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s previous wage offer Under the proposal submitted for ratification, flight attendants would get a 7.7 percent pay increase in their second year; a 6.4 percent increase in their fourth year, a 13.3 percent increase in their sixth year and a 27 percent increase in their seventh year. Under the proposed new wage scale, most senior flight attendants would earn about $ 35,500 a year in basic pay _ second in the industry behind <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> said. Entry-level flight attendants would be paid about $ 15,000 a year in basic pay, close to the industry average, he said. The contract also provides for pay raises of 2 percent in June 1990 and 3 percent in January 1992 for all current flight attendants, and a variety of one-time bonuses. Former <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers also would be placed under the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> pension plan, which would have its benefits boosted by 17 percent to make it level with the former Republic plan, <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> said. The pension and pay increases will add about $ 75 million to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s payroll over the life of the contract, <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> said. Some of the increase will be made up by adopting <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> work rules _ considered less expensive than rules covering the former Republic workers _ for all the attendants.

<HEAD>Personal Income, Spending Rise; Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 February surges in personal income and consumer spending are being cited by analysts as further evidence that the economy has suffered no long-term effects from the October stock market crash. But the new government reports failed to cheer Wall Streeters on Thursday, as stock prices took a nosedive that sent the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials down 43.77 points to 2,023.87. Separately, the government reported the savings and loan industry lost $ 6.8 billion last year, its worst loss since the Great Depression. In its latest eonomic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal income of Americans rose 0.9 percent in February, reflecting strong employment gains in the past few months. Spending rose 0.7 percent, up sharply from a tiny 0.1 percent January increase. Five months ago after the market crash, some analysts feared consumer worries about the future would cause spending cutbacks that could push the country into a recession. `` For people who were worried about a major consumer retrenchment, these numbers are encouraging,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` As long as income gains hold up, people will continue to spend.'' Analysts said the February gain in incomes, which followed a 0.3 percent January rise and was the best showing since a 1.9 percent October increase, reflected good employment news. The jobless rate fell to an 8 -LCB- - year low of 5.7 percent during the month In its report on thrift earnings, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 6.8 billion loss for the year included a $ 3.2 billion loss in the last three months of 1987. The year's loss was nearly 50 percent greater than the previous post-Depression high of a $ 4.6 billion loss in 1981. The nation's federally insured S & amp; Ls had a modest $ 132 million profit for all of 1986 Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $ 3.7 billion in 1987. In other economic reports Thursday: _ Business startups declined nationwide in 1987 for the first time since the end of the last recession, but the level remains strong and reflects economic stability, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said The 7.7 percent overall decline, from 253,092 startups in 1986 to 233,710 last year, affected all industry sectors and all regions, especially the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.5 billion in four-year notes at an average yield of 7.90 percent, down from 8.33 percent at the last such auction in December and the lowest level since four-year notes averaged 7.89 percent last June 24

 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a `` white knight'' friendly bidder and other alternatives to thwart <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 1.08 billion tender offer, which began earlier this week But <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> says Thursday's announcement, made in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing, changes nothing in its six-month effort to acquire the rival bank holding company. In the filing, which was an official response to the hostile bid, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said it was in the `` preliminary stages of negotiating with third parties'' in connection with a possible merger, reorganization, sale of assets or change in capitalization. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> also said it has begun furnishing information to unidentified parties its management intended to talk with still more groups. Irving officials have refused to comment further on the filing. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors repeatedly has denounced as inadequate <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to pay $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s roughly 18.1 common shares outstanding. `` From the information they've given we have no way of telling if there's something going on or it's a lot of smoke,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing. `` We see nothing substantative.'' Industry analysts also were at a loss over what <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s plans might include, although Wall Street welcomed its disclosure as a signal the bidding for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> may escalate. In active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> rose $ 6.62 -LCB- to $ 66.25 a share while <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.12 -LCB- to $ 31.37 -LCB- a share. `` I have no idea who they might be talking to,'' said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Erensel </PERSON>, senior analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` But it seems to me the priority for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> is to be independent first, seek a white knight second, and last of all to submit to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> possibly could keep its current managment team intact by merging with a foreign bank with a strong capital structure. `` It would be difficult for one of the larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks to merge with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> because.. -LRB- they -RRB- have relatively weak capital structures,'' he said Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> cleared a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Irving </ORGANIZATION> merger, saying it would n't hurt competition in the nation's biggest financial center. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has asked the federal courts to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> received the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s go-ahead to begin its tender offer, and the company also has assembled a slate of 16 nominees to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> holds a 4.83 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has stressed its desire to remain independent and has taken a number of steps to spurn <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s advances, including instituting an anti-takeover `` poison pill'' intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive. In another effort to bolster its takeover defenses and place stock in friendly hands, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> recently issued $ 100.1 million worth of cumulative convertible preferred stock to 15 investors. The stock expands voting rights and offers other entitlements that could foil a hostile bid. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> sued <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court to void the preferred issue. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> began its takeover efforts in September with a bid of $ 1.4 billion, or $ 80 in cash and securities. It revised the offer to $ 68 in cash and securities following October's stock market crash, and lowered the offer a second time in late January. Hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking industry. A merger between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> would create one of the nation's 15 largest bank holding companies with combined assets of more than $ 40 billion.

<HEAD>GATT Rules Against Implementation Of U.S.-Japan Chip Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A preliminary finding that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has violated international rules of commerce in its implementation of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductor trade agreement does not necessarily void the pact, officials say. The preliminary finding disclosed Thursday was made by a panel of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international body based in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that oversees the world trading system. The panel report said Japanese companies used improper means to prop up the export prices of semiconductors, including production controls and industrywide pricing rules. The panel's finding requires the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which meets May 4. It was made public Thursday by <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, chief negotiator of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, and later confirmed by the office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> itself declined to comment on the panel's finding, saying it remained confidential. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel made the ruling three weeks ago, with copies given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. It was kept confidential in hopes that the parties could work out their differences in private. The ruling was distributed Thursday to other <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> member nations, even though exact terms of the finding have not been publicly disclosed. The 1986 chip agreement was intended to stop <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from `` dumping'' chips at unfairly low prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other markets and to open up the Japanese chip market to foreign producers, including Americans. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> issued a statement saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was satisfied with the finding. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel has determined that the objectives of the agreement are consistent with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules but that some of the Japanese implementation methods are not. That is what we have been saying since the agreement went into effect,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> stated. `` Some of these methods of implementation, such as production controls, will need to be changed but the need to make these changes does not relieve <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of its obligation under the semiconductor agreement,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s alleged failure to abide by the pact triggered $ 300 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory tariffs last year against selected Japanese electronics imports. Of those sanctions, some $ 165 million remain in place. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never intended that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> cease third-country dumping by market manipulation. However, he said the Japanese government had sought to comply with the pact through `` production controls and quantitative restrictions, things we in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never agreed to in the first place. We never thought they were legal -LRB- under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> guidelines -RRB-.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> findings `` did not challenge the fundamental legitimacy of the agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Trade officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were away from their offices near the end of their business hours Thursday and could not be reached for comment. Competition from low-priced Japanese chips knocked most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers out of the business of selling the memory chips known as dynamic random access memories, or D-RAMs. In addition to complaining to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has launched a probe of its own into possible Japanese dumping of several types of computer memory chips. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> probe involves chips known as Eproms, which is short for erasable programmable read-only memories. If the Japanese memory chip manufacturers were found to charge unfairly low prices, their exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could be subjected to punitive levies. <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Bail </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman, said the Community's dumping investigation will continue despite the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> finding.

 <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s planned sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary would complete a nearly nine-month-old corporate restructuring to pare the railroad and energy conglomerate's holdings. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> announced Thursday it had agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, at undisclosed terms. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe restructuring announced June 30 was aimed at reducing the company's holdings to five core businesses in transportation, real estate and natural resources, said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> has sold or agreed to sell two other pipeline companies, a building contractor company, a timber company, a leasing business and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of its two railroads. The company expects to reap $ 1.7 billion after taxes from the sale of the businesses. The restructuring plan included a $ 30-a-share payout to stockholders totaling $ 4.7 billion. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the restructuring was intended to help pay down debt incurred in paying the special dividend and to improve the company's long-term growth and earning potential.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of troubled <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship bank will retire early, but not because of the bank's financial problems. <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>, who has been with the banking company since 1956, will retire April 15, he announced Thursday. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, also is president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the banking industry's main trade group. <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>'s announcement comes a week after First RepublicBank, the state's largest bank holding company with $ 33.2 billion in assets, announced it would seek federal assistance because of mounting loan problems and deteriorating customer confidence. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> gave <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> a $ 1 billion capital loan last week to stem a serious outflow of deposits. Bank officials are expected to recommend that <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON>, the corporation's chairman and chief executive officer, assume <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>'s position. `` With the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s stabilizing assistance and assurance that all depositors are fully protected, the permanent solutions and restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> are beginning, and I have asked <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> -LRB- Fronterhouse -RRB- not to consider me for responsibilities in the ongoing institution,'' <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> stated. The company also announced Thursday that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musolino </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, was elected company president. Fronterhouse will continue serving as chairman. Although senior <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> executives had agreed to resign if asked by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, as a condition of the $ 1 billion loan, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>'s resignation had not been sought. <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1956 and became president and a director of <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, then called <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, in 1974. He was elected chairman of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank and a director of the holding company in 1980.

<HEAD>Book Says GM Chief Has Vision But Not Implementation Skills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials are shrugging off a new book by a former employee who portrays <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as a man with a high-tech vision who lacked the people skills to implement it. In his book, `` Call Me <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s stewardship at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> since 1981 a `` tragedy in leadership. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> speech writer from 1984 to 1987, cites plant closings, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s decreasing share of the auto market, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s ascendance as industry profit leader and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s public rift with former <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, in making his conclusions <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired EDS in 1984, agreed last year to pay <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> _ a harsh critic of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> management _ $ 700 million in return for his <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> holdings and resignation from the board of directors. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> wrote of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> that, following the <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> departure, `` By almost every measure of management achievement ... his leadership had failed.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s former boss, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> public relations vice president <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, questioned <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s conclusions. `` -LRB- He's -RRB- just one guy who worked here two or three years, and he was in <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>'s office maybe six times. I do n't think he's qualified to talk about <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. The book is due in bookstores next month and will be excerpted in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s May issue. `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> is aware of the book,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s reaction. `` I do n't know if he's read any of it, but all we're saying is that we do n't think the book's worth commenting on.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> advanced via a fast-track executive development program that left him unschooled in the art of motivating employees. He said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> failed to realize that to make full use of its new technology, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would require the support of workers from its design labs to its shop floor. <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, who helped arrange interviews for <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and read an early draft of the book, disputed that contention. `` We've got the most modern plant structure in the industry,'' he said. `` We think we've got the best product line. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> has often said, ` We've crossed the river and others have yet to cross it.'''
