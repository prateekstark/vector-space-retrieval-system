 Senators approved a $ 14.1-billion deficit-reduction package Friday night after junking extraneous tax breaks and spending increases and postponing a showdown on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed cut in capital-gains taxes. The 87-7 vote sent the plan to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier passed a version that includes a capital-gains reduction. Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are expected to try to work out a compromise starting next week. The legislation is designed to push the estimated deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, slightly below $ 110 billion and avoid automatic, almost across-the-board cuts in most federal spending programs on Monday. With the House not in session until Monday, it appeared all but certain that the cuts would be triggered temporarily. But the reductions can be restored later. The way for final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the bill was cleared when senators approved by voice vote an agreement to strip from the bill hundreds of provisions prized by one member or another but which did nothing to cut the deficit. Stripping the bill of pet projects `` asks sacrifice ... -LRB- and -RRB- discipline of every senator,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said in urging approval of the agreement. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people recognize responsibility when they see it,'' said Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, `` and tonight they are seeing responsibility in action.'' Among provisions dropped from the bill: Extension of the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service, due to expire at the end of 1990; new tax credits for low-income families; extension of tax benefits for first-time homebuyers and workers who receive education and legal aid from their employers; dozens of narrowly targeted tax cuts; improvements in Medicare, Medicaid and child-welfare programs, and overhaul of the formula for government reimbursement of doctors. `` We think this is absolutely the best approach,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of the agreement to strip all but bare essentials from the bill. `` We get good government in the fair-deal sense.'' `` It is a very major step,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Voting against the bill were Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky.; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not likely veto the The official said that the administration was not happy with the turn of events, but that `` the stripped down bill gets back to budget basics.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will continue searching for ways to get his capital-gains proposal through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in other legislation, the official said. The essential part of the bill would raise taxes by about $ 5.3 billion and cut spending by $ 8.7 billion. But as the measure worked its way through eight committees, it picked up hundreds of amendments to benefit farmers, loggers, low-income families, the poor, the sick, the oil industry and higher-income retirees. The bill became so laden with benefits for one group or another that it had to include $ 38 billion worth of tax increases over five years to have enough money left over to meet deficit-reduction targets. Under the agreement, everything that did not cut the deficit would be removed from the bill. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the agreement `` ensures that we will have another tax bill very soon _ two or three weeks'' to which the capital-gains reduction, expanded <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> and any other amendment could be added. Echoing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Republicans insisted they were not giving up the fight to cut the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks and other investments. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was troubled by Democratic efforts to substitute expanded tax-deductible IRAs for the capital-gains cut, which he promised during last year's presidential campaign. `` We early on took a very clear-cut position on capital gains,'' he said. `` When I became president, there was no doubt at all where I stood on this.'' He refused to rule out a final compromise that might include both a capital-gains cut and liberalized IRAs. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreement was reached without concurrence from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which already has passed a deficit-reduction plan that includes a bitterly fought cut in taxes on capital gains. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of its bill would require negotiators from the two houses to work out a compromise between the stripped-down version and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> package, which has its share of provisions that do nothing to cut the deficit. The final compromise could include a capital-gains cut plus expanded tax-deductible IRAs for all workers. Or, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators could agree to consider those issues as part of some other tax bill later this year. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on deficit reduction had been delayed as Democrats _ who control the chamber by a 55-45 margin _ sought to keep a capital-gains cut out of the bill. In the end, it appeared Democrats had won the battle because Republicans could find no way to overcome a rule that would have required them to get 60 votes to add capital-gains to the legislation. When that became clear, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> offered to drop the issue as part of an agreement that would strip away all other provisions that would not cut the deficit, including the Democrats' <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> provision Most of the tax increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deficit-reduction plan would fall on corporations. Spending would be cut in scores of programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursements for doctors and hospitals and lower deficiency payments for some crops. User fees charged for a variety of activities, such as <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> services, would be raised to boost revenues.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today ruled out talks with pro-democracy activists and labeled one growing opposition group `` enemies of the socialist order.'' The government had promised discussions to cope with rising unrest and to seek the causes of a refugee exodus, saying it would talk to representatives of `` all parts of society.'' But in an internal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> position paper obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, party leaders warned that `` open and hidden enemies of the socialist order'' could create a mass movement at odds with the socialist government. `` Any association with such opposition groups would hurt the further development of socialism,'' the position paper said. The document was directed primarily at the opposition group <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, which has advocated free elections, greater openness in society and a free press. It said New Forum's platform was `` aimed at destroying the leadership role of the Socialist society'' and accused the group of being made up of `` enemies of the socialist order.'' On Thursday, the chief ideologue of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, indicated the opposition movement would be excluded from any discussions about political reform. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> promised during a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the East German government will consider changes following the departure of tens of thousands of citizens to the West and the most widespread public demonstrations since 1953. But his reference to possible talks with public organizations, church groups and other social forces did not appear to include the opposition movement. He said those challenging the foundations of socialism would have no role in the talks. `` If they want to question our social order, then that's not a basis for discussions,'' said <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the opening of a cultural exhibition. The communist government here routinely has accused the major opposition groups of trying to undermine socialism. The future of hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, meanwhile, remained a subject of widespread speculation. Party sources have said influential members of the ruling Politburo were upset over the way the 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has responded to the unrest. Party sources said he had been asked to provide a report on the `` critical situation'' of the nation before the end of this week. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, quoting unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources, reported Thursday that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> would be replaced on Oct. 18. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> over the weekend to help <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> celebrate its 40th anniversary and urged <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to undertake reforms. Tens of thousands of East Germans demonstrated in several cities and demanded political and economic reform; many asked the reform-minded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for his help. <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said late Thursday that officials in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> were preparing to give amnesty to all those arrested in protests there since Sept. 11. The number was not immediately known, but up to 500 people are believed still to be in jail. The Politburo promised Wednesday to examine the causes of the protests and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of young, skilled East Germans to the West. Opposition leaders Thursday said they were skeptical about the government's professed willingness to enter into real dialogue with any social forces. <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> painter and a co-founder of the opposition group New Forum, described the Politburo statement as a `` verbal shift that does not take into account real life.'' East German leaders have made it clear that any changes would occur only within the framework of the existing socialist system. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> welcomed the East German offer of a dialogue but said it `` should be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve domestic and international pressure.'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was optimistic. `` This could be the first positive signal to the populace that the East German leadership has given,'' <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said of the Politburo statement. `` But we must wait to see what concrete measures it carries.'' The government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has rejected pro-democracy reforms like those taking place in the Soviet bloc countries of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will allow a newly approved ban on flag-burning to become law without his signature, but `` I do n't think it's enough.'' He vowed to continue pressing for a constitutional amendment. During an appearance in the White House briefing room, the president said he was withholding his signature from the congressional legislation `` to signal our belief that a constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting protection for the flag.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented on the flag legislation in a brief opening statement before responding to questions on other issues. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in session, legislation can become law automatically if the president does not act on it within 10 working days of when it is sent to the White House. After <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has adjourned, a president can pocket-veto bills by refusing to sign them. `` I believe the American flag is a unique and special symbol of our nation and it should be protected from desecration, and our administration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protect the flag,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his statement. He proposed the amendment after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that flag-burning was a constitutionally protected form of free speech. The court ruling brought a flood of calls for an amendment to the Constitution, but after the initial response many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> including the Democratic leadership began looking for a way to deal with the problem through legislation rather than changing the Constitution. When asked if he were concerned about the political consequences of vetoing flag-burning legislation in the light of his attacks on Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the 1988 presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied that was a consideration in his decision. During the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his supporters repeatedly attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, for vetoing legislation that would have required public schools teachers in the state to lead pupils in daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the congressional vote was `` an overwhelming expression on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do something about the protection of the flag. I do n't think it's enough.'' `` I can understand the rationale of those who voted for the legislation, but in my view, it is not the ultimate answer,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 317-43 Thursday to complete congressional action on the bill. Supporting the bill were 154 Republicans and 217 Democrats, while it was opposed by 25 Democrats and 18 Republicans. The measure requires up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for anyone who `` knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The lopsided approval margin reflected the power of the flag as a political symbol as demonstrated in last year's presidential campaign and by the outcry over the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s June decision overturning a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning conviction. The court reversed the conviction of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on grounds the law violated his right to freedom of speech. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends a constitutional amendment would settle the issue once and for all and could not be overturned by a court. Such a measure is set to come before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next week. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., told reporters that someone at the White House _ he did not recall the name _ told him the president might stress his dislike of the bill while bowing to its popularity by letting it become law without his signature Soon afterward, White House sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was likely to follow that course. He could do that by allowing the measure to sit untouched after it reached his desk for 10 days while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remained in session. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declined to say what the president might do. `` We'll have to have a legal review take place'' when the bill arrives at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Congressional Democrats, declaring that constitutional amendments should be used only as a last resort, said their bill was so carefully worded that it probably could survive a court challenge. `` It is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flag rather than any action that the message might convey that is to be punished,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, D-Texas. He said the idea was to make flag defacement illegal regardless of whether it had anything to do with political protest and to make the statute `` content neutral.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> scoffed at that notion, however, saying there was no way to draw up such a bill. `` To those who believe we can overturn a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision at this time by statute, I can only repeat the immortal words of the farmer who, asked directions, said, ` You ca n't get there from here,''' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would to block the proposed constitutional amendment next week `` I think the amendment would be extremely ill-advised,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe we should rush into any action that would amend the First Amendment without the greatest care and obviously it would be, I think, reckless to do so, I think, at this point.''

 Armed civilians kidnapped a Swiss flight attendant in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> early this week and freed her today, security sources said. Police here could not confirm the abduction. In <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said the woman, whom he refused to identify, was kidnapped by gunmen in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday. A reliable <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the woman as <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 31, and said she was was released in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> this afternoon. The source said gunmen kidnapped Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> from a house in the village of <LOCATION> Koubbaa </LOCATION>, 31 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, on Sunday. <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> had said the kidnapping occurred in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, which is 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The source refused to identify the kidnappers but said the woman, a flight attendant with <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION>, was `` interrogated in connection with her activities and stay in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' He refused to elaborate. The abduction would be the third of a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> national in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a week. The two previous kidnappings were linked to the case of a Shiite Moslem militant serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for hijacking a jet. When asked about the latest reported kidnapping, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> police chief Col. <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Zein </PERSON> said today: `` I have no information at all about this kidnapping. We have neither a notification nor a complaint about such a kidnapping.'' `` I read the report from <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> in the papers this morning,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> when contacted by telephone. <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said the woman's parents asked authorities not to publicize the case. He told reporters of the kidnapping after being asked about unattributed news reports of it. `` There is no sign of a political background to this kidnapping,'' he added. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which controls much of northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, to help find the woman, he said. In all, 19 Westerners are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Shiite Moslems loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are thought to be holding most of the hostages. On Oct. 6, two <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Erriquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emmanual </PERSON> <PERSON> Christen </PERSON>, were abducted in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, and no demands have been made. Later that day, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman blamed radical Palestinian guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> for those abductions and linked them to a Shiite Moslem militant, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>. He is serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger. Lebanese police also blamed <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group for the Oct. 6 abductions. The <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> organization denied involvement. <PERSON> Birrer </PERSON> said he did not believe there was any connection between the kidnappings Oct. 6 and that reported Thursday. All Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel were withdrawn from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> following the kidnapping in November of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, a relief worker in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was released a month later, and the Swiss contingent returned after receiving assurances from all sides in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that humanitarian workers would not be targeted for kidnappings.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he opposes allowing Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest but held out hope a congressional compromise could be worked out that would `` avoid a veto on my part.'' At a morning news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly insisted he has not wavered in his opposition to a provision passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, and earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, that would drop a decade-long ban on federally funded abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators working out different versions of the broader legislation could produce `` room for flexibility.'' `` I'm not looking for any conflict over this. I'm not going to change my position any,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But let's see how these negotiations come out, and we'll start discussing that today. But I have not changed my position.'' Asked if he was leaving open the question of whether he would veto the legislation as passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Well, because I'm told that the conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part.'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said Thursday that there might be room for a compromise if both sides could agree to a provision permitting Medicaid abortions when the rape or incest victim reported that act within 48 hours of its occurrence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented a day after Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> conceded they could not override a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto of the bill and pleaded with him to reconsider. `` The president has the power to deny an opportunity for poor women to make a choice in their tragic circumstances,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` The president's position is wrong,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION> `` It is harsh _ terribly harsh _ on the poorest, most vulnerable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.'' In an outcome that surprised even the victors, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 216-206 to permit use of federal money to terminate pregnancies for poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who report it `` promptly'' to authorities. The provision would revise current law permitting Medicaid abortions only in cases where a woman's life was endangered by pregnancy and she could not afford to pay for an abortion. It is part of a $ 156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990 that has already been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but remains subject to final agreement on unrelated issues. `` Not only is this a reflection of the majority position of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, Democrat and Republican, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but the American people as well,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, joining <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> at a press conference to appeal to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This is a plea to the president to reconsider,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The votes are not there in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to override the veto. Therefore, he holds it in his power.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been dogged by political controversy on the abortion issue for a decade, and some anti-abortion groups have questioned his commitment to their side. As a candidate for president in 1980, before becoming <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the view that there should be three circumstances permitting abortion _ rape, incest and the threatened life of the mother. He muted those views after joining <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ticket. But once he started running for president again, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made statements that suggested his position was shifting again. In an appearance Oct. 7, 1987, at an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> high school, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a student who questioned him that while he opposes abortion, `` I would make the exception ... rape, incest and the life of the mother.'' The provision passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is narrowly drawn, permitting funding for abortions when the victims report the rape or incest `` promptly.'' Experts said the change might affect only a small number of cases, but it was widely viewed as a symbolic victory for supporters of abortion rights. It came as abortion rights forces were benefiting from an apparently shifting political climate on abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling in July. That ruling allowed increased state regulation of abortions, and abortion rights forces say it politically energized those on their side of the issue. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote came on the same day abortion rights groups enjoyed a symbolic victory in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The state legislature, in a special session called by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, rejected all the governor's proposed abortion restrictions. `` Certainly <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the vote yesterday in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are reflective of a new political movement,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` The climate is changing.''

 Civil rights leaders are demanding that the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> retract implications in his new book that the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had sexual encounters with women on the night before he was killed. A <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, woman said in an interview published today that she was with <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and King that night, and she disputed part of the account in <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s autobiography, `` And The Walls Came Tumbling Down.'' In his book, published this month, King's onetime top aide says <PERSON> King </PERSON> spent parts of the night before his death alone with two different women and physically fought with a third. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote that he awoke from a nap in a woman's living room after a late-night dinner to see King and the woman emerge from a bedroom. <PERSON> Adjua </PERSON> <PERSON> Abi </PERSON> <PERSON> Naantaanbuu </PERSON> told The Commercial Appeal in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> that she was host of the dinner and that she and her sister talked with King and another aide in the living room while <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who `` had too many'' drinks, slept on her bed. In an interview published today in The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> rejected suggestions by some of the civil rights leaders that two strokes and brain surgery might have impaired his memory. `` I am most surprised anybody would think I'm mentally incompetent,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> has said that he did not include passages about King's extramarital affairs out of malice, but felt he needed to address the issue since it had been discussed in previous biographies of the Nobel Peace Prize winner `` I loved Martin Luther King more than a brother. I would never do it to injure him,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said. A coalition of black leaders including <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Thursday they objected to the controversial passages and doubted that <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> wrote them. A spokesman for the book's publisher replied that the whole book was written solely by the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> minister The group's statement concluded that `` the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> section'' of <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s book was so out of character with <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s life and previous statements that it must have been `` put into your mouth by others who needed a sensational story to sell books and slander the name of your martyred brother.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the allegations are untrue. `` The book is entirely <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s words. There was no co-writer, no ghost writer,'' <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said. `` He stands by everything he says in the book. I wonder if all the people sitting back criticizing now have read the book. `` The book is not a sensationalized, ` put down <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>' book,'' <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said. `` He reveres <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and takes two pages to address what everyone has talked about before. He wanted to address it and be honest about it.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> _ appearing to promote the book Thursday in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where King was slain April 4, 1968 _ said he was surprised by the uproar. `` I'm not <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>,'' he told reporters. `` I know who I am. I'm a Christian minister.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, chairman of the board of The King Center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said a number of civil rights leaders including <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Benjamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, sent <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> a telegram Sunday calling on him to repudiate his writings. `` We take particular exception to your personal reconstruction of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s last hours on this earth,'' said the telegram, read to reporters by <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> at a news conference in front of King's tomb at The King Center. `` The <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> we know and love would not have written this section. ... We deplore the fact that, for this account, if it is not repudiated, will rob you of your rightful place in history.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> issued a statement that the character of <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s work would stand `` when all the dust clears.'' `` Dr. King can not speak for himself,'' the statement said. `` Those of us who appreciate Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s work will stand with him through every challenge.'' Hooks, in a statement released from <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said he had read the book and was `` deeply saddened and distressed'' that <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> `` would succumb to the temptation to desecrate'' King's memory. King Center officials said <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, president of the center, would have no statement other than to endorse that made by <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the center's board chairman. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, an African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> bishop, said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Hooks and former King aide <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, all of whom were in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> with <PERSON> King </PERSON> on his final days, have `` sharply different'' recollections of the events of those days.

<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Friday: I have a statement I'd like to make, and then _ some time constraints _ be glad to answer a few questions. I believe that the American flag is a unique and special symbol of our nation and it should be protected from desecration, and our administration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protect the flag because we believe that is the most _ the most lasting and legally correct means of protection, a constitutional amendment. And yesterday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill providing statutory protection for the flag, and when this measure comes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, I will allow the bill to become law, but without my signature. And I am withholding that signature to signal our belief that a constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting protection for the flag. We will continue to work for such an amendment, and I can understand the rationale of those who voted for this legislation, but in my view it is not the ultimate answer, and therefore I will not put my signature on the legislation. I would now be glad to take questions, all of which, I am sure will be on the flag. Q. Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. President. You have said on several occasions that you knew everything at the time of the Panamanian coup, and you did n't feel that there were any really problems in retrospective. At the same time, there are many reports that you've changed the rules of procedure on handling _ on crisis management, and that you have asked the Hill for more authority to operate during a coup or plan a coup or whatever. Can you straighten this out for us? And ... A. Let me help you out. Q. Obviously there were glitches, or you would n't have spent two weeks trying to defend yourself _ I mean, the administration. A. Well, I'm not sure I agree to the last part. Q. You have spent two weeks trying to explain to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people what you did. A. No, this is the first chance _ shot I've had at explaining. Q. Not you per se, but your administration. A. Oh, I see. No, I _ what was the first part of the question? Q. That you have changed the procedures on crisis management, and ... A. No, look, here's what _ it's coming back. Here is my position. I have not seen any fact in all the reports that have come out that would make me have done something different in terms of use of force. And I reiterate that. Now, in terms of procedures, I'll simply say, any time we can make improvements, so much the better. But there has not been an intelligence gap that would have made me act in a different way. And so _ and I repeat that. And there's been endless interviews and discussions and stories, many of which are false, that come out as to what we were asked to do or not to do. But I've seen no fact that would make me change my view. And I've seen allegations that we had _ if when I said I wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to get out there, that implied use of force. I hope I would never be reckless enough as a commander-in-chief to make a blanket commitment to use of force if _ without knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt. We want to see Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. I'll repeat that. I've been very heartened by the reports from various leaders in our hemisphere.

 about what <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should do. So _ but I do n't see any serious disconnects at all. And if we can fine tune our crisis management system, so much the better. And I think that's what you're reading about now.

 A Syrian pilot who landed his plane in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said today he defected because he wanted to live in a democracy and would refuse any offer by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to return him to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has denied the pilot was a defector and asked the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to intervene. Maj. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> refused to answer most political questions at a news conference arranged by the Israeli army, but he said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> pilots considered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force superior to their own. He recounted how he flew across the border at high speed and as low as 30 yards off the ground, `` going into the unknown'' in search of freedom and a place to land. He said he made the decision to defect on his own for personal reasons and had no contact with anyone in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before he piloted his Soviet-built MiG-23 over the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` I decided to cross the border in electronic silence,'' he said. `` I was not in contact with anyone. Nobody was expecting me. `` It was a difficult mission. I did n't know where I was going to land. I did n't know if I would find a facility to land. I was going into the unknown,'' the 34-year-old flier told Israeli and foreign reporters. Much has been made in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over how <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> crossed the border without being intercepted, although he reporedly was in Israeli air space for seven minutes before landing. `` The section I was crossing was spread all over with missiles,'' the short, wiry pilot said. `` I crossed at very low altitude and very high speed.'' When asked to be specific, <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said he flew at 700 to 750 mph and `` below 50 meters -LRB- yards -RRB-, sometimes 30 meters, sometimes 40.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON>, who was dressed in an olive green flight suit, spoke in Arabic and his words were translated into English by Israeli officers. The news conference was held at a military base near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The pilot said he defected in search of freedom. `` I wanted to live in a democracy where people can express their views with freedom,'' he explained. Asked to comment on Syrian politics, he repeated his desire for freedom and added that `` by implication you can presume my thoughts about the political system in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> was asked whether he would see a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has requested. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> wants to meet me and take me back to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, I would refuse this,'' he said. Asked if he hoped to remain in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said, `` I said I wanted to live in a democracy ... so you might conclude I want to live here.'' However, he said he had made no definite decisions about his future. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> would say little about the MiG-23 he piloted across the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> to a civilian airstrip near <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION>, 57 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Nor would he compare it to other Syrian air force planes. He also refused to discuss his family and whether he was discriminated against because of his Sunni Moslem religion in a country where the president, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, and many military leaders belong to the minority Alawite sect. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said he received `` gentle'' treatment from the Israelis, was asked mainly about his reasons for defecting and had not yet been questioned about the Syrian air force. When asked if Syrian pilots felt they had gained superiority over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he replied: `` No one in the Syrian air force feels that they could defeat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that they are superior to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said he was born in the Syrian town of <LOCATION> Aleppo </LOCATION> and was a graduate of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. He said he decided `` a long time ago'' to defect and had been planning it seriously for three to four months.

 A fire in a bustling <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> neighborhood detonated 2,000 pounds of illegally stored fireworks, destroyed one building and injured 17 people, officials said. The fire, which broke out about noon in a building that had a small grocery store on the ground floor, was controlled at 5 p.m., but pieces of the building continued to smolder this morning. Firefighters worked to finish tearing down the six-story brick building to prevent it from collapsing. The blaze spread to two adjoining buildings, igniting as many as 29 explosions in fireworks stored illegally in one of the buildings and forcing some of the 200 firefighters to evacuate, said Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>. `` I'm very distrubed about that,'' <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> said. `` We could have lost a lot of firefighters there.'' Of the 17 people injured, 13 were were treated at the scene for minor injuries, three were treated at area hospitals and released, and one _ a firefighter _ was hospitalized in stable condition suffering from smoke inhalation, spokesmen said. The fire broke out just before noon in the compact and congested neighborhood of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> restaurants, bakeries, apartments and small businesses, casting a pall of thick black and gray smoke over the city's skyline. The fire appeared to have started on the ground floor of the six-story building, where there were reports that workers might have been using welding equipment or cutting torches, <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> said. The cause remained under investigation, and preliminary estimates put the damage at $ 2 million, he said. Damage estimates for the two other buildings were incomplete early today. Within the last month city officials had ordered the stoppage of illegal construction work at the building where the fire started, said fire Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>. Firefighters had trouble getting adequate pressure in their hoses, said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. He said he was unsure if more pressure might have saved the six-story building, but he said it might have enabled firefighters to keep the flames from spreading. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said two valves under the street had been closed, possibly by a contractor doing work in the area.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> resigned today, yielding the government to a three-party non-socialist coalition after 3 -LCB- tough years of minority rule. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syse </PERSON>, 58, will become prime minister on Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> remains until then as caretaker. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>'s resignation followed a loss by her <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of eight parliament seats in the Sept. 11 election. The party fell to 63 seats in the expanded 165-member Storting. The 50-year-old prime minister helped topple the same Conservative-led alliance in 1986, and some analysts predict her return to power within a year. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> presented her resignation to King Olav V today and referred the monarch to <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> about a new government. <PERSON> Syse </PERSON>, an attorney, will polish his coalition of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parties </ORGANIZATION> and assign Cabinet posts this weekend. `` I can assure you the government will be ready at the right time,'' <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> said after seeing the king. The new coalition controls 62 seats. It had the support of the extreme right 22-seat <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> in its threat to evict Labor in a no-confidence vote unless Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> stepped down. Labor's ally, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, has 17 seats and there is one independent. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> is best known abroad as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Environment and Developement. In opposition, she is expected to chair parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. The coalition's position is tenuous. The anti-tax <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said it wo n't guarantee support, since the coalition refused to make it a partner. `` They wo n't last more than a year,'' predicted <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafferty </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political scientist who has lived in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> for 22 years. <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> may even turn to Labor to support some of his programs to avoid being held to ransom by the extremist parties. `` It's anyone's guess'' whether the coalition can last until elections in 1993, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said in an interview. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> has no mechanism for early elections, and if <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> ca n't hold his partnership together, Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> probably would move back into the prime minister's office Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> was credited for helping to cut inflation in half, turn a trade deficit into a surplus and slow consumer spending. But she left the country with postwar record unemployment of 5 percent.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief of naval operations says Soviet arms control proposals would place undue restrictions on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to protect American interests and `` deter aggression. Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, the first chief of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military service to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, made the comments Thursday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. A text of his remarks was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top man noted with some amusement that he was spending today, the 214th anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, `` here in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, visiting ships in your fleet ... meeting officers and men in your <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that my being here marks a milestone in the progress that our two countries have made in just the past few years toward improving bilateral relations and easing some of the tension that has characterized our dialogue for the past four decades,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said. But the admiral had few kind words to say about Soviet proposals to limit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval power around the world. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> mentioned proposals from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and others that would exclude anti-submarine forces from certain security zones; exclude all naval force activity from certain strategic straits and high density shipping lanes; limit naval exercises; or place restrictions on the movement of ships with nuclear-capable weapons. `` Any one of these would result in the inability of my <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to protect the global interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or to deter aggression. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces must be free to operate when and where deterrent presence is required, and operate unimpeded by restrictive sanctions,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said he also opposed any restrictions on the use of sea-launched cruise missiles, calling compliance with any such limitations `` unverifiable without unacceptably intrusive inspections.'' The admiral contended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is dependent upon overseas trade for its economic well-being, whereas `` seaborne trade for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not a matter of national survival.'' `` When viewed from this perspective, I strongly feel that my country's reluctance to enter into naval arms reductions is justified by the facts and is a prudent and rational position,'' the admiral said. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> also dismissed Soviet calls for limits on the 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carriers that ply the high seas, calling them the `` backbone'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and a useful tool for deterring `` would-be aggressors.'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> noted that when former Soviet military chief <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and its bases `` threaten the security of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy is not intended to threaten anyone.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces `` are only a threat to someone who would intend to threaten our interests or those of our allies,'' he said.

<HEAD>Board Members, Athletes Quit Over Private School Racial Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two school board members resigned and seven athletes quit an all-white private school's football team after it forfeited a game with a school that is fielding a black player. `` I just felt it was time I did n't serve on -LRB- the board -RRB- anymore,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who has been a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> for two years. He did not elaborate. The resignations and walkout by the players followed confirmation by <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> Headmaster <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> that the school would not play <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, which has the first black player in North Central AA Conference history. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, one of the school's founders, said earlier this week that race had nothing to do with the decision. He said the action involved something `` private'' that he could not discuss. But several questioned his decision. `` It's a racial thing, no question about it,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, whose son was a starting tackle and linebacker before quitting the team Wednesday. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> refused Thursday to answer additional questions about the decision. A broadcaster also said Thursday in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> player <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was banned from broadcasting a game at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> because he is black. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> were scheduled to broadcast the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Academy-East </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> game on television on Aug. 25. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, an ex-Mississippi State standout, was told he should not come, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' charge. `` That was not the case,'' he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Janous </PERSON>, another <PERSON> East </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> school board member, said he sent a letter of resignation last Friday after serving on the governing panel for more than 10 years. Asked why he resigned, <PERSON> Janous </PERSON> said: `` I do n't want to say ... I think you probably know.'' Among the seven atheletes who quit were four starters in tonight's game against <ORGANIZATION> Grenada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kirk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. East <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> has 17 players remaining on its roster. `` How do you function?'' asked <PERSON> East </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> coach <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: about now. Q. Well, have you asked for greater authority from the intelligence committees to act in such cases? A. No, I have not, but we had a very good meeting with two leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, the other day, but I have not asked for that. We may _ we may _ Q. You're satisfied with the power you have? A. Well, I want as broad a power as possible, and I think under the Constitution a president has it, but I'll be working with the _ has broad powers, broader than some in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the House might think. I may have a difference with some on interpreting what the powers of the president might be, but I want to work cooperatively with these committees, and it was with that in mind that we invited <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> here, but I've not made specific requests of them. We might. We might do it. But we have not done it yet. Yeah, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>? Q. Mr President, Democratic leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are urging you not to veto legislation to remove the ban on federal financing of abortions for the poor. House Speaker <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> says your position is harsh, terribly harsh on the poorest, most vulnerable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women. Will you let that legislation become law? A. My position is well known and well stated. And right now there is some negotiation and discussion going on. I have not read the conference language, and so we're going to be meeting with some of the various most interested congressional parties on this and see what can be resolved. I'm not looking for any conflict over this. I'm not going to change my position any. But let's see how those negotiations come out, and we'll start discussing that today. But I have not changed my position. Q. But you're leaving it open about whether or not you would veto this? A. Well, because I'm told, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, that the conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part. Yeah, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, in other words, you are willing to negotiate or accept a compromise that in some way would allow federal funding for abortions in cases of rape or incest. A. No, I've already said what I'm willing to do _ discuss the conference language. Yeah, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>? Q. Let me ask you specifically. Are you _ A. Is this a follow-up? Q. Yes. Are you willing to compromise? A. I'm not willing _ I've already told you my position Yeah? Q. Let me ask you a question about your position. Can you explain why you believe it's all right for women who can afford an abortion on their own, that in cases where they are raped or in cases of incest that it's permissible, but that for poor women who can not afford abortions, it is not permissible to help them get abortions in cases of rape and incest? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, the only answer I can give you on that is to go back to the original Hyde Amendment, and to the position that I took and will stay with And to some, there might be a contradiction there; to me, there is none. Yes, <PERSON> John </PERSON>? Q. If I may follow, sir, I mean, it's not a question of a contradiction. It seems that if you can pay it yourself, it's okay under those circumstances, but the message, it seems, is that if you ca n't afford it yourself, tough luck. And is n't that a moral conflict in your own position? A. There _ no, I do n't think it's a moral conflict in my own position. Yes, <PERSON> John </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, could I return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for an instant? A. Yes. Q. Would you _ what message are you sending _ you say you want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out _ what message are you sending the PDF then? Would you like them to attempt another coup, or is that out of the question? A. Well, I do n't think anything's out of the question I think that from what I've seen, and the reports I've heard out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, things are more unsettled than before about the fate of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. I would simply reiterate that we have no problem with the PDF itself. I think this rather sophisticated argument that if you say you'd like to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, that implies a blanket open _ open carte blanche on the use of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> force. I do n't want to mislead somebody, and to me that's a _ you know _ a stupid argument that some very erudite people make.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reflecting on the failed coup against <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said today he still hopes to see <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader ousted and brought to justice and added, `` I would n't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner.'' At a mid-morning news conference in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he opposes House-passed legislation providing federal funds for abortions for poor women who are victims of incest or rape. But the president said he hoped compromise language would make it possible to avoid a veto of the politically charged legislation. On another controversial subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would permit legislation banning flag burning to become law without his signature. He said the legislation was n't `` the ultimate answer,'' and urged a constitutional amendment to do the same thing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signaled his desire for flexibility on other issues, as well, including <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> calls for expanded individual retirement accounts and legislation to repeal catastrophic health care for the elderly. But there was no give on his defense of his much-criticized handling of the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> two weeks ago, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed nearby were not directed to intervene on behalf the rebels. `` I would hope I would never be reckless enough as commander-in-chief to make a commitment to force without knowing the facts'' of a coup attempt. He said he'd seen no evidence of a crucial gap in intelligence. `` I would n't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner,'' he said in defending the decision not to take part in the coup. `` So I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.'' While saying he would not change his decision against using force, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged complaints about poor communication and other problems by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said they were `` well worth looking into'' and that he was not opposed to `` fine-tuning'' his crisis-management system. He hinted broadly he might seek congressional approval for greater authority in dealing with situations like the coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We may, we may,'' he said. `` I want as broad a power as possible and I think under the Constitution the president has it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued his defense even as he was walking out of the briefing room. `` I can understand instant hawks appearing from where there used to be the feathers of a dove, because some of it is political and some of it is the frustration they feel because this man -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- is still in office,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve his plan for a cut in the capital gains tax, and said he would consider signing legislation that combined his plan with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal liberalizing individual retirement accounts. `` The mixing of IRAs and capital gains in this debate is troublesome to me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Whether there is room for compromise on that, I'd leave it to those who are negotiating.'' Most of the attention during the question-and-answer session was focused on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The Panamanian leader is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug trafficking, and the president said he's not willing to have the indictment dropped in exchange for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> giving up power. He blended his call for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster with his defense of his own actions two weeks ago. `` I am not going to give carte blanche support for an operation, particularly when they do n't ask for that support,'' he said. `` I have to reserve that right, I have at stake the lives of American kids.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside critics who said he missed an opportunity to assist in <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster in the failed coup. `` I've seen no fact that would make me change my view,'' he said. On the flag legislation, the president said: `` I will allow the bill to become law, but without my signature. I am withholding that signature to signal our belief that the constitutional amendment is the best way to provide protection for the flag.'' Asked about attempts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal catastrophic health care legislation for the elderly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` letting the congressional process hash this out.' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked repeatedly about the volatile abortion issue, and said he hoped he could avoid a veto of legislation that calls for Medicaid funding for abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. `` I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' he said. `` My position is well known and well stated and right now there is some negotiations and discussion going on,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Aides have suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would likely veto the bill if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version is embraced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He said he wanted to see if there is `` room for flexibility.'' The House has passed the provision and sent it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which approved similar provision a year ago and is expected to do so again. `` The conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part.''

<HEAD>Pope Celebrates Final Mass of Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEDAN, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pope today celebrated the final Mass of his Indonesian tour and urged Catholics here to be bold in proclaiming Christian values in this predominantly Moslem nation. The pontiff stressed themes of family and social teaching at his final stops but also acknowledged difficulties facing the church in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> gave a positive summation of the trip, saying no obstacles had been placed before the pope and that he spoke with `` absolute freedom.'' But the pontiff again used guarded language when referring to potential conflicts with the government or Moslem community. His last Mass here was attended by 100,000 people amid lush coffee and palm oil plantations in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION>. In a speech to the country's 42 bishops later in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged Catholics to be bold in proclaiming their Christian values. He acknowledged `` occasional difficulties'' facing his 5 million-member flock but reminded them that religious freedom is protected by the constitution. There are 157 million Moslems in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. `` Do not be afraid to encourage the Catholic people to -LRB- be -RRB- an ever more public witness to the truths and values of their faith, in keeping with their rightful place in the society of which they are worthy citizens,'' he told the bishops. Raising another delicate issue, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said `` You are sometimes painfully aware that certain traditional practices and other contemporary social influences bring about an obscuring of fundamental principles regarding family life and the responsible transmission of life.'' He did not elaborate but was apparently referring to polygamy and the government's aggressive birth control program. The church bars artificial birth control. The church as well as the government here is concerned about increasing pressure from Moslem extremists. The Moslem influence is reflected in two proposed laws before parliament. One would make Islamic religious teaching mandatory in all schools, including <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> ones, and the other would set up Islamic courts for marriages, wills and inheritances. The only trouble during the pope's stay occurred Thursday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, when youths opposed to <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule of the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony clashed with police at the end of the papal mass. They held up banners greeting the pope in the name of an anti-Indonesian guerrilla group. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> watched the incident calmly and made no mention of it afterward. The pope is scheduled to leave Saturday for the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. He returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Monday.

<TEXT>
 Four 24-cent stamps printed in 1918 to inaugurate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air mail delivery fetched $ 1.1 million at an auction, the highest price ever paid for a stamp collectors' item, officials said. The airplane depicted on the stamps was inadvertently printed upside down. The stamps, considered the finest philatelic item in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are called `` Curtiss Jenny'' because the airplane shown is a model <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> JN-6, which carried the first air mail deliveries, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Trepel </PERSON> of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, which handled the sale, identified the buyer at Thursday's auction only as `` an American broadcast executive.'' The stamps were uncanceled and included a border bearing the four-digit number of the plate used to print the stamps. Another block of four <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> stamps that did not include the plate number sold for $ 528,000. The original sheet bearing 100 <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> stamps was bought for $ 24 in 1918 in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> post office by a private collector. The <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> stamps and other philatelic items sold at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s were from the collection of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, 74, and his brother, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, 78, renowned stamp dealers who have run a stamp shop in the French Quarter of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> since 1932. The 342 lots auctioned went for a total of $ 4.29 million. Another big seller was a block of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stamps bearing a picture of a car that inadvertently was printed upside down. The stamps, issued in 1901 to commemorate the opening of the Pan-American exposition in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, sold for $ 203,500, <PERSON> Trepel </PERSON> said. Among the other items sold was a telegram cover with a Pony Express insignia, which went for $ 99,000. The telegram was sent in 1860 from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but since the telegraph line terminated in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, the last leg of the journey between <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was made by <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>.

 Several black <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers are challenging a settlement of a racial descrimination lawsuit against the company, saying the payout is too small. Attorneys said the settlement could cost <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 million immediately and up to $ 40 million over the next five years. An appeal filed Thursday with the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> says the case was poorly handled and the settlement too small. Last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feikens </PERSON> approved a settlement of the lawsuit originally filed by four employees in 1983. It became a class action suit three years later involving 10,000 black <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The black workers claimed an employee appraisal system, dropped by the automaker after the suit was filed, resulted in lower pay and fewer promotions for blacks between 1982 and 1986. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Thursday saying the settlement was fair. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>, an attorney who represents a group of black <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees challenging the settlement, said the appeal will stop implementation of the settlement. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, an attorney who negotiated the settlement for the plaintiffs, said the appeal would cost about $ 1 million a year in attorneys' fees.

<TEXT>
 A federal jury began deliberating today whether Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and his wife extorted payoffs from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a defunct defense contractor. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who instructed the jurors Thursday afternoon, told them to begin their discussions at 10:30 a.m. Also Thursday, the panel heard closing arguments from <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s lawyer, who said the prosecution did not prove the couple's guilt `` No one was paying off <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> helped <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> get government contracts because he was a good public official, he said. The lawyer described <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> as a dedicated and honest politician who rose from the ghetto to represent his neighborhood in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> wants nothing more than to go back to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and serve his constituents,'' he said. <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> said the $ 76,000 that the government contends was funneled by <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> to Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s consulting firm to pay for <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s political influence was for work unrelated to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. A $ 20,000 loan <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> received from the company was `` a loan among friends,'' he said. He claimed <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman, to make the loan to the congressman's sister, who passed the money on to Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, because he knew it would n't look right to take a loan from a constituent. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members are not required to report loans from family members on their financial disclosure forms, <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> said. He noted that the loan was promptly repaid. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a 56-year-old Democrat, and his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, are accused of conspiring to obtain $ 185,000 in checks and interest-free loans, and a diamond and emerald necklace for Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, from officials of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The couple was charged in a seven-count indictment with conspiracy, extortion, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. If convicted of extortion, they face up to 20 years in prison. Their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal at <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop that grew into a multimillion-dollar defense contractor through various bribe schemes. The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of corruption. <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> attacked the credibility of <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, the government's key witness `` Did <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> lie in this case? Yes,'' <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> said. `` He lied about everything that would incriminate these people.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> pleaded guilty to theft - and bribe-related charges in 1987 and testified at other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trials In the prosecution's rebuttal which followed <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON>'s arguments, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> denied the defense's argument that the prosecution presented a one-witness case He said 27 other witnesses and 500 documents corroborated <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s testimony.

What they're saying is _ and it's only a handful of critics _ `` You said you wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. You say you have no argument with the PDF. An element tries to get him out. And you did n't support him.'' And I'm saying, yes, I want him out, and yes, we have no argument with the PDF. But I am not going to give carte blanche support to an operation, particularly when they do n't ask for the support.'' And I have to reserve that right. I have at stake the lives of American kids. And I am not going to easily thrust them into a battle unless I feel comfortable with it, unless those general officers in whom I have total confidence have _ feel comfortable. So, my argument is with the `` argument.'' My argument is with the argument that when I say, you know, I'd like to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, that that means carte blanche commitment on my part of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> force. I'm not going to do that. Yeah. These two. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> LA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> is reporting today that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has given the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> the go ahead to arrest fugitives in foreign countries without the foreign country's consent. Now, this reverses the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration's policy. Can you tell us what led up to this event, and perhaps what _ A. No. I'm _ Q. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has to do with that, because he's a fugitive? The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can go into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> now. A. I'm embarrassed to say I do n't know what it is your _ I'll have to get back to you with the answer to your question <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>, will you take care of that? <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> FITZWATER </PERSON>: I'm not sure that's happened. A. I do n't know what it _ I've not seen the <ORGANIZATION> LA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report, so I'll just have to not comment until I do Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, your explanation of why you did not back the coup seemed to imply that it would almost have to be an American operation and an American-planned operation before you would use American troops. Is that a misreading of what you've said? A. A little bit, yeah. A little bit. Q. Well, could you explain by what you _ I'm only a little bit off? A. Yeah, just a hair, because if the circumstances under this coup plan had been different, the requests had been different and the facts on the ground had been different in terms of what we knew, we might well have done something different. So I _ is that helpful? Q I'm not sure. I have one other question on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, if I may. A. Have two, come on.

Mr. President, you mentioned remarks of the prime minister of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> earlier.

Is that a deal you can live with? A. I did n't _ I do n't recall that part of his statement, but <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, I ca n't do that. It would send an impossible signal to _ in this fight against drugs. I ca n't drop a good indictment, and I'm told by the attorney general the indictments are sound, that it is n't some grandstanding appeal. I ca n't drop those indictments _ Q. What do you think _ A. _ or encourage that they be dropped. I'm not sure a president can drop an indictment anyway. But I would not encourage that.

 Intelligence sources say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is partly to blame for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inaction during last week's failed Panamanian coup because lawmakers precluded at least one covert action for which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought clearance. And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today renewed his implicit invitation for rebels to overthrow Panamanian dictator Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and renewed the promise of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. `` I would n't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` So I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year barred the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration from exercising certain unspecified options in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` that might have led to a different outcome'' in the coup, according to intelligence sources who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. `` The reason we did n't have total information -LRB- as the coup unfolded -RRB- was because of the action of some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' said one source. There was `` interference'' and `` second-guessing'' when the administration proposed a set of actions designed to give it better inside knowledge of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the source said. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has made no specific request of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees since the coup for additional authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But, he added, `` we might'' make such a request later. `` I think under the Constitution a president has ... broad powers, broader than some in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the House might think ... I want to work cooperatively with these committees.'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said policymakers need to provide better guidelines as to when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel can become involved in a coup, particularly when there is the possibility of assassination _ something banned under current policy. `` Does it follow from this prohibition that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel are confined to a purely passive role of gathering intelligence?'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Or are there circumstances in which they could provide information or assistance to groups seeking to overthrow dictatorial governments and establish democracies? There appears to be confusion surrounding this question.'' On Thursday, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration denied <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allegation the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> paid $ 1 million to rebel officers to launch last week's failed coup. The administration contends <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were notified in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but did not play a part in planning it. The intelligence sources said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year of options involving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an intelligence `` finding,'' a document required to be given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before covert actions are undertaken. Some of the loudest criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the Oct. 3 coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by PDF rebel officers has come from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. But House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., without mentioning names, said Thursday that there is `` plenty in the -LRB- classified -RRB- record ... to know that some of these people are going far beyond what they've got the ight to say about the administration's requests in the past, what was granted and what was denied. One member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> alluded to the congressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations bill for intelligence agencies, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cautious response to the coup was justified in part by interference from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Who could expect this administration or any administration, or any intelligence agencies, to make gutsy decisions when we have lashed them, put them under the whip, tethered them, told them they better not do anything?'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, R-Pa. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> noted that some on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has received `` everything he wanted with regard to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` And yet we know there are those who have gone to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and threatened them with exposure -LRB- of -RRB- classified information, and said, ` You dare not engage in covert operations,''' <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television last weekend, `` Since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> became president, every single word of authority that he has requested from the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and every single penny that he has requested from the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> relating to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he has gotten and he has gotten with my support.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> investigators discovered a bank account in the name of Capt. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, one of the alleged coup leaders, with more than $ 1 million. `` There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Six zeroes. It was a million dollar account.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it's absurd, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says there's nothing to it and I say we do n't believe anything <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says.'' But the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> played a role in planning the coup, including advising rebel officers to seize <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at a meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were certain he would attend. Attributing the information to unidentified congressional and administration sources, the newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s advice was a major factor in the delay of the coup by one day.

<HEAD>Thatcher Urges Continued Military Might as Conservatives End Conference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> today said it has been `` a fantastic year for freedom'' but told her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that despite this, military might must not be allowed to lag. She also scorned the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for abandoning its policy of unilateral disarmament, calling it a desperate move to win votes. In a speech to the final session of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s four-day conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also gave strong support to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, whose recent decision to boost interest rates has caused discontent within party ranks `` The torch of freedom we lit in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> all those years ago, the symbol of our party, has shed its light across the Iron Curtain into <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` What a fantastic year this has been for freedom _ 1989 will be remembered for decades to come as the year when the people of half our continent began to throw off their chains.'' The prime minister turned 64 today, and as she entered the conference hall, an organist played `` When I'm 64.'' Despite the changes in the communist world, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the potential for conflict lurked around the world. `` Yes, we are ready to negotiate to reduce the levels of weapons on both sides, but only so long as it can be done without jeopardizing our security,'' she said. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s call for a 25 percent cut in defense spending, she said, would endanger that security, and she scorned <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s new commitment to multilateral instead of unilateral disarmament. `` Labor's supposed conversion to multilateralism is no more than a confidence trick to try to make Labor electable,'' she said. Turning to economics, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she understood that higher interest rates worried home owners, farmers and small businesses. `` But when the choice is between high rates now, or persistent higher inflation later, with all the damage that would do, the choice is clear. `` Inflation will come down through the use of high interest rates as it has in the past,'' she said, and commended <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> and his predecessor, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, as `` the two finest chancellors of the exchequer since the war.'' Interest rates are now at an eight-year high of 15 percent and will remain high in an effort to curb the 7.3 percent inflation rate, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said Thursday. Despite fears of an economic crisis and persistently poor poll ratings, the traditionally loyal and well-discplined party activists have cheered some uncompromising messages from <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers during the conference. But outside the conference hall, there have been expressions of unease. `` Many people are feeling rather let down,'' delegate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Thursday after <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> announced the continued high interest rates. `` They are rather upset that after 10 years of Conservative rule we should have got into these rather difficult times,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. At fringe meetings, there also were signals the Conservatives need to find a new agenda after dominating the decade with right-wing policies based on tight money, curbing unions, selling off nationalized industries and building up <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> warned that the party needed to ensure that `` people recognize us as a listening party, just as much as a crusading one.'' The interest rates, hitting homeowners and businesses, have exacerbated the Conservatives' problems, midway through Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s third term. She has been in office 11 years. Polls show widespread opposition to key sections of her current political program _ a shakeup of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, plans to sell off to private enterprise the water and electric utilities, and a new property tax. Meanwhile, the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a new, more moderate platform and is presenting the Conservatives with their most serious challenge since 1979, when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ousted Prime Minister <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>'s Labor government. Labor has been in the lead in poll ratings for the past four months and now has an average 7-point edge.

 Thousands of radical students staged anti-U.S. protests today, burning <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and hurling rocks at police after fellow students broke into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's home and went on a half-hour rampage Ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife escaped unhurt from the incident in which students, hurling homemade bombs and swinging iron bars, smashed artwork and other objects before police dragged them out. Later, about 2,000 radical students demonstrated against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or South Korean governments on at least 11 college campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, police said. They said about two dozen students were arrested. At <LOCATION> Konkuk </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kyunghee </ORGANIZATION> universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, hundreds of students hurled rocks and firebombs and fought police, who fired tear gas. They burned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and effigies of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. The six students who occupied the <PERSON> Greggs </PERSON>' home gained entry by throwing homemade bombs to distract police guards outside the residence, police said. They then scaled the wall around the house, throwing tear gas to keep guards away. The <PERSON> Greggs </PERSON> said they heard the intruders on the other side of their locked bedroom door but managed to escape via a side door. After occupying part of the residence, the students blocked the main door with chairs and sprayed the floor with paint thinner, which they threatened to ignite if police attacked, officials said. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the ambassador's residence is not guarded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines. Korean police are responsible for guarding the outside of the house. Embassy officials said they would review the security system. The students who attacked the residence were from a self-proclaimed `` Anti-U.S. Death Squad.'' They were protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressures on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to open its markets and demanded that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> cancel his visit next week to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was on his way to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to prepare for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s visit. The attackers smashed objects and rampaged through the house in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for about 30 minutes before riot troopers firing tear gas forced their way inside and seized the students, police said. `` Punish <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>!'' and `` We oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure!'' the students shouted. One was draped in a South Korean flag. Police said one student was slightly injured in the scuffle. They said they were searching for four other students who helped the six attackers into the compound. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Meg </PERSON>, said they were sleeping when they heard an explosion near dawn. They did not see the students but heard them on the other side of their locked bedroom door. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> dismissed the attack as the work `` of six people who broke into our home, and I do n't put a larger signifiance on it than that.'' In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` just asked if they -LRB- the <PERSON> Greggs </PERSON> -RRB- were safe and I assured him they were.'' Radical students have tried to use <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s appointment to galvanize anti-U.S. protests, contending the former <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> CIA station chief was sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to impose military rule. They held anti-Gregg protests after he arrived in September, burning the ambassador in effigy. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s appointment was opposed by some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators because of charges he misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his role in the Iran-Contra affair as then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser. Some South Korean opposition leaders questioned whether a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official was a suitable choice as ambassador, but the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government said it welcomed the appointment. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> condemned the attack as a `` senseless riot,'' and the main opposition parties also denounced it. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s radical students are a small but vocal minority on college campuses. They have little public support because of their violent tactics and extremist views. The radicals oppose <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, claiming the government is a front for American rule. They have staged a series of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities to demand withdrawal of the 43,000 American troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. They also want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop trying to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> drop import barriers to help reduce <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s huge trade debt with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Many South Koreans believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure is unfair, contending their markets are still vulnerable to competitive foreign products. However, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> today adopted a resolution urging the government to work out a gradual timetable for opening South Korean markets. In a rare compromise, the governing party and three opposition parties joined forces for the resolution, which said agricultural markets should be opened gradually and carefully after considering the nation's `` vulnerable agricultural structure.''

 Blacks nationwide planned huge celebration marches as black leader <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and several colleagues were flown today to jails in their hometowns in preparation for their release. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police informed <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON>, that restrictions on her had been lifted and said her husband would be freed this weekend. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, who has been jailed for 25 years, is one of eight political prisoners whose unconditional release was approved by the government Tuesday. He is the most prominent jailed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement after <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The release of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, has not been approved. Seven of the prisoners to be freed are <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The other, <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON>, belongs to a smaller black nationalist guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and at least four of the other prisoners were flown to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> early today from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where they had been jailed, airline officials said. They were visited by lawyers later at Diepkloof Prison, near <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Another of the group, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, was flown from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to his hometow, <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. The oldest of the eight, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, 80, remained at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Groote </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Schuur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he has been for much of his term, but spent part of the day being fitted for a new suit. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> lives near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Anti-apartheid leaders applied to magistrates to hold what they called `` victory marches'' in 17 cities and towns across the country Saturday to celebrate the releases, which are all expected over the next few days. The New Nation, a militant anti-apartheid newspaper, said at least 250,000 people were expected to join the marches. Its front page today was printed in the green, black and gold colors of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and it carried pictures of seven of the prisoners under the headline `` <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lives </ORGANIZATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, speaking to reporters at her home, said she would join the planned march in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.

Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, who had been banned from attending meetings and making public statements since February 1988, said police came to her home to tell her of the restrictions being lifted. `` I was wondering how I was going to cope at my house if my husband was not restricted and I'm restricted,'' she said. `` I was surprised.''

Despite her restrictions, Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 71, was issued a short-term passport by the government earlier this year so she could travel abroad with other anti-apartheid leaders.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: too much. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, when you were saying before that you would n't allow a carte blanche to any attempted coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, you're reserving to yourself the right to evaluate the merits of any potential coup. This implies, however, better communications with the participants than you had. In fact, it appears that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did n't know a good deal of the time what was going on during the crucial hours of that Tuesday coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> What sort of urgency _ here's the question _ what sort of urgency are you giving to improving those procedures? A. We're reviewing the procedures to see, but, if there's some, ca n't, if we ca n't do it better. But let me just reiterate: There's enough known about this that nothing different would have happened, and I keep coming back to that as the fundamental point. That is n't to say we ca n't do things better, but you've got to look at where these _ in this particular instance _ the people were coming from, what they _ what their objectives were. I know what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' objectives are: one, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> brought to justice; and, very important, a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule, not deny the people the very election that they had. And so these are our objectives. These are the objectives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And I will look at whatever comes up in the future with those objectives in mind. Q. Well, just to follow, on the day of the coup _ A. Hey, I've got a 10:00 meeting. Q. On the day of the coup we hear about telephone calls that are n't returned, we hear about people who are using phone numbers that they're _ A. Q. _ given for contact with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and when they call, they do not get help. The official _ A. That's well worth looking into. Q. _ -LRB- ff mike -RRB- _ A. Exactly. Q. That's what I mean when I suggest the urgency about it. A. No. I think you've got a good point there. And we will be doing everything we can to fine tune the mechanism. Everyone knows that, when you have a combat situation, and there was with the PDF and the coup people, it is n't all that clear. But to the degree we can improve our communications, fine. But I do n't feel _ again, I want to just end up where I started. I do n't feel, in looking at all the charges and the allegations of this nature and having them assessed both here and down in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by our leaders, that it would have led me as the president to do something different in this particular coup. But you raise a very good point. When I hear something that there was a, you know, a phone number given and nobody answers the phone, we'll find out what's the importance _ what's the significance of that. I really do have a 10:00. This is not a _ Q. How's your hand? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>, I was hoping you'd ask. Q. Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the military a _ Q. Why did you put a `` gag order'' on members of the administration telling them not to second-guess how you and other members of the administration handled _ A. Listen, we've been blessed in this administration by a good team who do n't like the game of `` who's up, who's down, who's winning, who's losing, who's looking good, who's in, who's out. And I did not have to have any gag order because all of them are singing from the same sheet of music. So there was n't a gag order. Q. You did n't tell people to stop complaining? A. No. Q. A week ago? A. No. Q. Did you get angry? A. And I did n't get angry. I did n't get angry. Q. What did you _ A. What I did say is I do n't want to see any blame coming out of the Oval Office, or attributed to the Oval Office, in the face of criticism. I'm not in the blame business. Blame, if there's some to be assigned, it comes in there, and that's where it belongs.

 A raucous party near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Oshkosh </ORGANIZATION> turned into melee when police arrived to break it up, with students breaking windows and damaging cars, officials said today. Seventeen people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, unlawful assembly and disturbing the peace, said Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichman </PERSON>. Some 60 police officers, university police, the <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> were called to quell the disturbance Thursday night and early today, <PERSON> Eichman </PERSON> said. `` Let's call it what it is, a disturbance,'' <PERSON> Eichman </PERSON> said, adding he did not consider it a riot. An estimated 500 to 600 students gathered after officers arrived shortly after 10 p.m. Thursday to check on a loud party across the street from the university campus, <PERSON> Eichman </PERSON> said. Some students began marching down the street toward the downtown, breaking car and business windows, damaging street signs and strewing garbage, he said. Some officers sustained minor injuries when they were struck by debris, he said. `` Two people were arrested for disturbing the peace at the party, but we did n't get any further because it mushroomed into something a little bigger,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Obfuscation is the name of the game in bureaucratic <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON> is a master of mimicking the gobbledygook that passes for communication under the Capitol dome and in the White House. But his sense of theater is stretched mighty thin in `` Mastergate,'' a relentlessly one-note spoof of the Iran-Contra hearings that opened Thursday at Broadway's Criterion Center. `` What did the president know, and does he have any idea that he knew it?'' <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON> asks. It's a funny line, but the question is never really answered in this satire that would rather play with words than plot or character for 90 long minutes. `` Mastergate'' focuses on fictional congressional hearings held by something called the Permanent Select Joint Committee. It discovers a scheme by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to take over Master Pictures, a big Hollywood film studio. Through its filming of a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war epic called `` Tet: The Movie,'' the government-controlled studio is funneling money to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oltros </LOCATION>, freedom-fighting guerrillas in the Central American country of <LOCATION> Ambigua </LOCATION>. Among the public servants called to appear before the committee are the vice president, the secretary of state and a gung-ho, media-savvy military officer named <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, the nation's only four-star major, who bears more than a slight resemblance to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` Publicity is a small price to pay for security,'' testifies Battle while his wife, knitting an American flag, sits adoringly beside him. The spoofing is broad and more than a little obvious as <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON> attempts to dazzle with quips, doubletalk, bad puns and a few hilarious sight gags. Check out the look a certain gray-haired, pearl-bedecked wife of the vice president gives her husband when he testifies. Or Maj. Battle's medals, so numerous his lawyer has to wear some of them on his lapel. Designer <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>'s hearing room, with a hokey backdrop of the Founding Fathers, spreads out all over the wide stage and even up into the auditorium where the congressional inquisitors sit. `` Those who forget the past are certain to be subpoenaed,'' drawls a Southern senator played with the right amount of bourbon befuddlement by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilty </PERSON>. Between witnesses, an intense televison newswoman, <ORGANIZATION> Merry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, recaps events for the folks out in television land. She has her own jargon, just as difficult to decipher as the governmental chatter. The debasement of language is a major theme of <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON>'s play. Everyone has been co-opted, he seems to be saying, politicians, the public and even the press. Maybe that's why a few of the reporters are played by mannequins. Within the cartoon limits of the characters, two actors stand out _ <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bargen </PERSON> as the mad major, and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a triple-threat man who plays a right-wing senator, a liberal congressman and the departed <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief. Director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Engler </PERSON> tries hard to keep the play from droning on like a real congressional committee meeting. There are jarring lighting and music effects to keep theatergoers awake. And if they get tired of looking at the stage, the audience can watch the show on television monitors scattered throughout the theater. In the end, <PERSON> Gelbart </PERSON>'s wordplay turns preachy with the appearance of the dead <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director looking like <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' Ghost of Christmas Past. He warns of future scandals if the public is n't vigilant _ which is hardly surprising advice. It's a somber and uninspired conclusion to a play that telegraphs where it's going in the first few minutes of the evening and then keeps recycling variations of the same jokes in an attempt to get laughs. What other critics said: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: When `` Mastergate'' is funny, it is very funny. When it is not, it still stands up for a patriotic integrity beyond the understanding of the clowns who parade across its national stage. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON>, Daily News: If you think the title is funny, you'll probably enjoy `` Mastergate.'' If you find it adolescent, which I'm afraid I do, stay home and read <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> on politics. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON>, Newsday: `` Mastergate'' ... is a one-joke extended sketch that, unfortunately, never manages the leap to dramatic _ much less philosophical _ revelation of much we did n't already know. Nevertheless, the joke is a very good one, performed with deadpan delight by deft imitators.

<TEXT>
 The surviving members of <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Flying Circus sent flowers in the shape of a giant foot to Friday's funeral for comedian <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` To <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> from the other five Pythons with all our love. P.S. Stop us if we're getting too silly,'' said a note attached to the flowers, modeled on the foot that dropped down with a rude noise to end the group's television shows. The message recalled <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s appearances as a stiff-backed colonel who barged in to end sketches that had become `` too silly.'' Services for <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who died Oct. 4 at age 48, were held at Vinters Park crematorium, with close friends and family attending. `` Not many of us take the opportunity to express our convictions in the way that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did and he specialized in a brand of humor which satirized pomposity,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, chaplain at <LOCATION> Maidstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s last words to <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> were: `` The events of this last year have renewed my faith in human nature.'' The minister said, `` Through these words we catch a glimpse of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> who though vulnerable, overcame many fears.'' Mourners at the service included <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s companion for many years, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON>, and his adopted son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomiczek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> had planned to stay away from the funeral but had a last-minute change of mind. `` Both <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and I believed in caring for the living, and not mourning after the dead. He would have understood why at first I was n't going to go. `` But I thought about it, and felt it was only right that I should be there for his very last moment,'' <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> said.

Later, however, Zairean authorities jailed him briefly because of the provocative content of some of his songs.

He later wrote `` Beware of AIDS,'' a hit song on the Central African pop charts in 1987 that became a battle cry against the deadly disease. He had been living in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> since the early 1980s. He is survived by 17 children. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> ordered a four-day period of mourning in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, with government flags at half-staff and official radio playing soft music. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s body will be returned on Saturday.

Of this amount, approximately $ 2.5 million will be devoted to restoration of the Octagon. `` Restoration will be as complete and authentic as allowed by the intended use of each space,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koonce </PERSON>, president of the foundation. `` Thus, the period rooms and the exterior of the building will be carefully researched and accurately restored, while other spaces _ such as our exhibition galleries _ will be improved appropriately.'' He said all of the restoration work will be carried out by specialists skilled in traditonal building crafts. The Octagon was designed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, the first architect of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol, and completed in 1801 as a city house for Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayloe </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> plantation owner and friend of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>.

 Higher tides than normal caused by an unusual alignment of the sun, moon and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> began lapping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s hurricane-ravaged beaches today, but little erosion or flooding was expected, forecasters said The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said high tides on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coasts could be up to a foot higher than the highest tides of the past few years. The pre-dawn tide in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today was 6.6 feet and tides were expected to rise to 7.3 feet by Monday, or slightly higher if accompanied by gentle winds, the weather service said. Normally, tides are 5 feet to 6 feet. In <LOCATION> Folly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where at least 23 beachfront structures were destroyed by Hurricane Hugo and others left teetering on foundations, today's tides did no damage, said Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Linville </PERSON>. `` I went down and checked where we were expecting problems,'' he said. `` I think truthfully if the wind does n't become a factor we might come out of this thing.'' On the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, high tide could equal the highest marks of recent years, the service said. `` The threat of coastal flooding increases if a storm surge should occur at the same times as the astronomical high tide,'' the service said. Tide tables will show the expected heights. Fishermen, boaters and residents of flood-prone areas should consult the tables and be alert to weather forecasts, the service said. Higher than normal tides also will occur Nov. 12-13 and Dec. 10-12, the service said.

 The leader of a community college group said Friday that state legislatures are biased against urban colleges and that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> takes no interest in their problems. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and Junior Colleges, spoke at a news conference called to release a report on innovative programs at community colleges. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON>, under secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said at the news conference that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials see community colleges as crucial to economic growth. `` We see jobs as the engine of opportunity,'' <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON> said. `` We see jobs and payrolls as the way people are going to rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities and we see community colleges as a way to get jobs or get better jobs.'' <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> called that `` a great challenge for community colleges.'' However, he said, `` they are not going to do it if they do n't have the help from the decision makers.'' Asked why the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> was not represented at the news conference, <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> said: `` They have not taken any interest in urban education.'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` has shown more interest in this subject than anyone else in this Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> said. Education Department spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON> said he had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s remarks, but said he would look into it. `` I'd say there is a bias in state legislatures against urban colleges,'' <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> said. `` I say that respectfully. We have formulas that do not apply to urban colleges.'' <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> also was critical of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This week <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put a cap on part-time students in student financial aid,'' he said. `` Urban colleges are filled with part-time students. What kind of priority is it to say we are going to limit the number of part-time students? I do n't understand that kind of priority system.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and chairman of the association's commission on urban community colleges, said such colleges need financial support. `` We are not necessarily talking about substantial additional dollars at this point,'' he said. `` I think we are talking about conceptualizing how we as a nation are going to begin to pull together current resources to address urban problems.'' The association's report described projects ranging from a senior citizens' center at a former dormitory at the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> community college center that serves as a focus of the amnesty program for illegal aliens and offers almost 200 credit courses taught bilingually.

 Retail sales rose a moderate 0.5 percent last month, the government said Friday in a report analysts said shows consumer spending is still fairly strong despite a slowing economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 145.2 billion last month after gaining 0.7 percent in both August and July. The revised July figure was even stronger than the 0.5 percent first reported. `` It shows there's good, solid consumer spending out there,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Even excluding automobiles, sales were up 0.4 percent,'' <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> noted. `` Furniture, department and drug stores, they all were good sales numbers and I think that's what we want to see. We do n't want to see a recession.'' Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and are one of a number of indicators watched by analysts to determine whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s tight-credit policies are threatening to stall out the economy or just slow it enough to keep inflation in Retail sales have risen every month since February, except for June, when they were unchanged. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector of the economy has grown sluggish, due in part, <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> said, to slowing exports. Lawrence A. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, deputy chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> should not interpret the retail sales report as a sign of excess demand overheating the economy. `` To the contrary, price discounts and ` everyday low prices' are fueling the rise in consumer spending,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. He called on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> instead to reduce interest rates and thus induce businesses to invest more to meet growing consumer demand. Durable goods sales slowed to a 0.6 percent gain in September, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said, following a strong 2 percent hike in August that was boosted in part by a 2.2 percent gain in automobile sales. But the early summer sales were driven by end-of-model-year incentives that are usually offered in September and distorted the 0.5 percent auto sales gain reported in September, analysts said. The 0.5 percent gain reflected higher prices in September because dealers did not discount vehicles as they usually do, according to economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Unit sales actually dropped by 400,000 vehicles during the month, he said. Besides automobiles, sales of other durable goods categories split _ furniture and other home furnishing sales gaining 1.3 percent while building materials fell 1.8 percent. Non-durable goods sales rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent drop in August. All categories except apparel gained _ department stores, 1.7 percent; grocery stores, 0.3 percent; gasoline stations, 0.3 percent; restaurants and bars, 0.2 percent, and drug stores, 1.4 percent. Apparel sales were down 0.5 percent after rising 0.8 percent the previous month. For the three months from July through September, overall retail sales were up 6.4 percent. Retail sales so far in 1989 were 6.1 percent above those in the first nine months of 1988.

 Fire swept through a shantytown Friday, killing eight people, destroying 200 houses and leaving 1,000 people homeless, officials said. Authorities blamed arsonists. The dead were trapped in the mud-and-straw houses when the fire engulfed the Kallayanpur slums on the northern outskirts of the capital, a firefighter said. Residents said the blaze was started by students from a nearby college who poured gasoline on the huts. The plot where the slums are located is apparently claimed by the college, they said. Fire officials said `` miscreants'' started the fire, which raged for about an hour before it was extinguished. An official said the students also tried to block the firefighters. The police said no arrests have been made.

<HEAD>Independent TV Forming, Has Contract for 5,000 U.S. Films</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An independent company has been formed to break the staid government television's monopoly, and it has gained rights to show outside programming, including 5,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films, a report said Friday. `` There must not be a monopoly, there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers,'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutsenko </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> company, told the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nedelya </ORGANIZATION>. The company is working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year, the report said. State-run TV has been one of the chief means through which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has tried to inculcate officially approved values into the population. It has become freer under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and some programs have sparked controversy On one program, there was a debate on whether <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s body should remain in its famous mausoleum on Red Square. The majority of its programming, however, remains staid. <PERSON> Lutsenko </PERSON> told <PERSON> Nedelya </PERSON> that he recently had been to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pick up the rights to show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, I concluded two contracts according to which we obtained the rights to 5,000 of the best American films,'' he said. Official TV occasionally shows foreign films, and its coverage of events and the cultural life of other countries has increased dramtically in the past several years. Another aim of the network is to uncover local talent in the cities where it is operating, and help them find a place on national Soviet TV and abroad, he said. <PERSON> Nedelya </PERSON>'s article was accompanied by a picture of <LOCATION> Lutsenko </LOCATION>, by profession a scholar of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs, interviewing American singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> plans to use official television's communications initially but eventually is seeking its own satellite system. Even though it will be independent of official television, <PERSON> Lutsenko </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> plans will have an oversight board that will includes parliamentarians, members of the Communist youth league, the Union of Filmmakers and others. `` We are all in the same boat, and <ORGANIZATION> Nika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to rock it,'' <PERSON> Lutsenko </PERSON> said. `` We will not be out of control.'' However, it plans to focus much of its programming on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s current political and economic difficulties, he said. `` The pain and losses of our economy, culture, ecology _ these are the basic themes of our programs. Ecology is the first priority,'' he said. But there also will be entertainment, music and sports. The company has branches in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, and is organizing in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, and the Baltic republics, the report said.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> met with striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> coal miners today and announced that the company chairman and the union president have agreed to meet with her Saturday. Face-to-face negotiations are the only way to settle the 6-month-old walkout, she said. `` I feel frustration with the impasse,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We're talking about communities being torn apart and in some cases families torn apart as I've heard talking with miners this morning. The two sides have held bargaining sessions since the strike began April 5, but in separate rooms with federal mediators shuttling messages back and forth. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> had agreed to meet with her in a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office About 1,700 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> are on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who visited picket lines to listen to miners' concerns about health benefits and job security, was careful to point out that she was not taking sides in the strike and planned to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> officials later today in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I'm not a mediator,'' she `` I'm not here to say I have the answer to this complex problem, but I do feel now it is time to see if we can facilitate the bargaining process.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spoke to some of the 280 pickets at the entrance to a coal preparation plant that 98 striking miners invaded and occupied for four days in September. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> strike captain <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said it `` gives us a shot in the arm to know that the secretary of labor is interested enough to come for a first-hand view.'' Miners told Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that the contract <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is proposing would reduce their health benefits, threaten the stability of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> pension fund and eventually break the union. `` They trying to destroy our union,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a picket captain from Castlewood. The company repeatedly has denied it is trying to break the union. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, the 3-year-old daughter of a striking miner, gave Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> a bouquet of flowers and told her, `` Get a contract for my daddy.''

 Three rare white rhinos from a zoo in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were en route Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. `` We consider this a goodwill gesture, a contribution to the general improvement in relations between our two countries,'' said <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicek </PERSON>, deputy director of the Dvur Kralove Zoo. `` Money plays no role here.'' In 1975, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagner </PERSON> brought the first six white rhinos to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, gradually creating the largest such herd in captivity. It is estimated that there are no more than 17 white rhinos living freely in Central Africa, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Keeping the only big herd in isolation is risky and so it was decided to share our females with <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kubicek </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> is not only the richest zoo with perfect subtropical climate, but the scientific potential there is excellent as well,'' <PERSON> Kubicek </PERSON> said.

 That striking man who had a rendezvous with a beautiful woman in front of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> on Friday looked familiar. A lot like <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. It was, in fact, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, with actress <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> _ his co-star in `` The <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>,'' the film version of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Carre </PERSON>'s latest spy novel now being made in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Of course, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> has a dossier on me,'' said the 59-year-old Scottish actor, who made a career out of playing the Soviet intelligence agency's formidable foe. `` That's why they let me in.'' `` My dossier in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is even bigger than the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> file,'' <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> said with a smile. This time, <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> plays a book publisher recruited by British intelligence after he comes into contact with a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> scientist smuggling defense secrets. `` Spying is waiting,'' a character in <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Carre </PERSON>'s novel says. The same is true of movie-making, said the film's producer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslansky </PERSON>, as the actors and dozens of extras went through two hours of take after take in a freezing drizzle in front of the hotel. <PERSON> Maslansky </PERSON> said the filming at Soviet locations, which began in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> Oct. 2, costs up to $ 10,000 an hour, excluding the actors' salaries. The total cost of five weeks of filming in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be $ 2.5 million, he said. <PERSON> Maslansky </PERSON> said the filming was made possible because of the `` glasnost,'' or openness, policy of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Under previous leaderships, there would have been a problem filming a <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Carre </PERSON> novel,'' he said. Instead, <PERSON> Maslansky </PERSON> said, there has been nothing but cooperation. Not that the story line is anti-Soviet. If `` The <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> House'' has villains, they are the old-style <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bureaucrats who refuse to shed their Cold War mentality and reflexes when faced with new realities. Although the script was reviewed by the state-run film company <ORGANIZATION> Mosfilm </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maslansky </PERSON> said there were no attempts to alter the chronicle of the Soviet scientist's attempt to smuggle military secrets to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, using a woman named <PERSON> Katya </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> -RRB- as a conduit. `` Its really a love story set against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Maslansky </PERSON> said. `` Mosfilm read the script only to make sure it was n't anti-Soviet or pornographic.'' During filming, he said, curious Soviets come not to see the stars, but to watch the film crew of Soviets and Westerners eat food shipped in from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> because of shortages and lack of variety in the Soviet capital. `` All the food is catered from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, feeding up to 150 people daily,'' the producer said. `` People come from all over just to look at the food ... It's kind of sad.'' The California-born <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> said playing a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman, accent and all, is the biggest challenge of her acting career. She is being coached in dialect and spends as much time as possible with Soviet members of the crew. `` It's the most difficult role I have ever done,'' she said, `` the first character of a completely different culture.'' The producers expect `` The <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> House'' to be released in 1990. Its release will coincide with the publication of the novel in Russian _ another example of glasnost. The book also will be serialized this year by two magazines, the monthly Foreign Literature and the weekly <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>, the producers said. The British author's previous works include `` The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'' and `` Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.''

 Nestled amid the oaks and cypresses that shelter deer and alligators in <LOCATION> Brazos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> is the nation's newest observatory, the only one of such magnitude that will regularly be open to the public. Contractors and volunteers working for the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> are putting finishing touches on a $ 1.3 million installation of the 10-ton, 36-inch research telescope at the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, which opens Saturday. The museum, using a $ 770,000 grant from the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, bought the 20-year-old telescope, described as one of the largest and most powerful telescopes available, from <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. Then, given a choice of about six sites by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, museum officials selected an isolated spot in the 5,000-acre state park, about 45 miles southwest of downtown <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Although other observatories around the nation may open their doors to the public on occasion, advance reservations and other restrictions are usually in effect. The <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, will be available for use by anyone; the only fee is the $ 2 per car admission charged to enter the park. The current schedule will allow the public to view the stars every Saturday night, first come, first served. About 25 people will be allowed inside the observatory dome for half-hour periods. Other nights are reserved for school groups, researchers and advanced observations. Museum officials say area schools have made plans for at least 8,000 children to visit the telescope. `` Part of the problem in science is that it's so focused on the laboratory _ that's what kids think science is,'' <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumners </PERSON>, the museum's director of astronomy and physics, said in an interview this week. `` What we're doing here is focusing on the observational sciences _ earth science, environmental science, ecology, astronomy _ where you ca n't manipulate the environment. You just observe it. And that's the way humans are. Most of our lives, the less we mess with the environment, the better. The more we observe it and understand it, that's what matters.'' `` When the public gets this, they're going to want to see the planets,'' said <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, an engineering consultant who worked with an identical telescope at the <ORGANIZATION> Kitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` Saturn is just beautiful.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and several other workers have been tinkering this week with the dials and gears and bearings and mirrors that comprise the telescope, surrendered by <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> because of the $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 annual upkeep the device required. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> museum officials, in the market for such a telescope, leaped at the opportunity in the spring of 1987. Construction of the actual observatory began in March. As part of the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> school will get to use the observatory for two weeks a year. Besides the public access, another unusual feature of the observatory is its location _ the highest spot in the park is just 64 feet above sea level. Most telescopes are perched high on mountaintops to escape city lights and air pollution. Scientists determined that the site had the darkest, clearest and least polluted sky in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area. The Milky Way extends from horizon to horizon and star patterns are clear, they say. Ms. <PERSON> Sumners </PERSON> said she hopes to have monitors installed shortly that will capture the images seen through the telescope, allowing even more people to take advantage of the observatory. `` There's nothing like this in the country,'' she said. `` That's what this place is all about _ real science No exhibits, no simulation. Here the science is real.''

 The bar owner glanced from the door to his only customer, thinking of bombs and his misfortune in choosing a location that might become a battle zone in the government's war with cocaine barons. `` It makes me sad to think people wo n't come here because they're afraid they'll get hurt,'' he said. `` I get even sadder when I realize that maybe they're right, that maybe a bomb could blow this place to pieces at any minute.'' The owner, who asked to be identified only as <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON>, opened the bar five months ago in a building beside a political headquarters. It was a good spot then, but has become a risky one since terrorists working for the drug traffickers began bombing such offices. <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> acknowledged his problems paled beside the national turmoil that resulted when Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, the leading presidential candidate, was assassinated in August and President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on the drug gangs in response. A retaliatory bombing campaign by the drug traffickers has killed 11 people, wounded 162 and shattered the nerves of thousands. Colombians are of two minds about the war. One side says there would be no trafficking problem if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> noses did not require so much cocaine, but that the blood being shed in the war is <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION>. Assassins working for the drug cartels have killed 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a justice minister, an attorney general, the president of the country's largest leftist party, a newspaper publisher, a governor, <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> and hundreds of other people. Those who favor pressing the campaign say <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> would surrender its sovereignty to the billionaire traffickers if it negotiated with them and granted amnesty. <PERSON> Zoraida </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a 24-year-old <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> photographer, said the armed forces were winning because `` they've raided hundreds of the drug traffickers' properties and have sent the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> bosses underground.'' <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a northwestern city, is the base of the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s biggest cocaine gang. No bosses of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> cartels have been captured so far, but <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said she would not be surprised to see a `` big fish'' netted soon. `` I get the impression that the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> bosses are on the run,'' she said. `` They've responded with a terrorist campaign that has n't won them anything except the hatred of the people.'' Most Colombians avoid reporters. If they do talk, most want their names withheld for fear the traffickers will come looking for them. Many apper to think the anti-drug war is futile, that the trafffickers can outlast the government with their riches, bombs and clandestine armies. Futile or worthwhile, it has sown fear and disrupted life in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and other cities. Telephoned bomb threats cause people to rush out of stores and offices, stay home at night and avoid certain places at all times. They duck when vehicles backfire. Many normally busy restaurants and discotheques are empty. How long will Colombians put up with such conditions? The answer to that may determine whether the government wins, since any significant weakening of public support could end the struggle. President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, aware of the danger, appeals frequently to the people. He approved television advertisements offering $ 250,000 for information leading to the capture of two chiefs of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. The ads urge people to denounce drug traffickers `` for yourselves, for your children, for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' Citizens whose patience has been swept away with the shattered glass express irritation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which some consider the real force behind the government's anti-drug campaign. A common complaint is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not doing enough to fight drug use at home. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimates Americans consume 300 tons to 400 tons of cocaine a year. Many Colombians feel the war is between society's elite and the government on one side and the drug cartels on the other, with no stake for the ordinary people who are being blown up. Others, prepared for an extended struggle, worry about its long-term effects on society. Despite a violent history, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> takes pride in its democratic tradition. It has had comparatively few military coups and rights are protected in a constitution dating from the 19th century. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallon </PERSON>, a human rights lawyer, said <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has endangered civil liberties by extending his power to fight drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas. He cited such decrees as one allowing the government to hold not just drug traffickers, but any `` subversive,'' incommunicado for seven days without formal charges. Gallon said there were three possible courses for the drug war: a continued, violent standoff; a negotiated settlement or a government victory. `` A government victory ... may be the worst of the three possibilities,'' he said. `` If <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> defeats traffickers, it will be at an extreme cost to what is left of our democratic institutions and basic rights.'' A settlement is unlikely unless a scapegoat is found for the terrorism committed by drug gangs, he said, because `` there are some crimes, like the assassination of Sen. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, that the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> people will never forgive.'' Prolonged violence is the most likely, he said, and could affect Colombians for generations. `` Colombians feel anxiety about the future,'' Gallon declared. `` We wonder about what effects the violence will have on our children and grandchildren, what kind of society we will be left with when this violence ends, if it ever ends.''

 Turkish Cypriot leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> met Friday with Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, but both the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> government denied any shift toward recognition of the self-declared state. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Greek Cypriot officials stressed the informal nature of the meeting, held over lunch in a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dining room. `` This is simply in keeping with our desire to help resolve the conflict,'' said one official, who asked not to be named. The sensitivity over the meeting is a reflection of the bitter conflict between the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island's Greek majority and Turkish minority, which has defied resolution for 26 years. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> has known <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> for many years and received him as head of the Turkish Cypriot community, not as leader of the breakaway state. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> maintains continuing contact with <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> and we believe his meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are fully in keeping with our desire to be of assistance to the intercommunal negotiating process of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, through which we hope a lasting peaceful solution emerges,'' she said. It is the first time <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> has visited the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> since he declared a breakaway state in the northern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> six years ago. Only <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which has provided 30,000 troops to the Turkish Cypriots, has recognized the state. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> and Cypriot President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> began talks in 1988 in an attempt to dissolve the partition. But the talks under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices have stalled, with each side blaming the other. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> was received by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House last week, and <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> is following in his footsteps to garner support for the Turkish position. `` We feel very strongly that we've been discriminated against too long, and we want to be heard,'' <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> told reporters. The Turkish Cypriot community, about 30 percent of the island's population, wants a federation with the Greek part of the island to be ruled by a central council of ministers The presidency would rotate between Greeks and Turks, <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Urged to be `Hard-Nosed' in Protecting Copyrights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should follow a policy of `` hard-nosed pragmatism'' in efforts to combat piracy of copyrighted publications, computer software, videotapes and audio recordings, according to a report released Friday. The study was prepared by a task force of 23 industry, academic and government representatives brought together by <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. `` Piracy of intellectual property is costing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tens of billions of dollars in lost sales and royalties,'' said attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, principal author of the report. `` Protecting intellectual property and stopping the flow of pirated products are critical to the future of our information-based economy.'' The report offered examples of technological piracy including: _ Pirates issued their own version of the Encyclopedia Britannica in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> before the legitimate edition could be published and kept selling it despite court rulings _ About 1,000 video parlors in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and many more throughout the Third World, show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign movies without paying public-performance license fees and, in some cases, without even buying the videocasette from its legal distributor _ Hundreds of thousands of decoders for receiving satellite television transmissions have been tampered with, allowing people to view programs carried by Home Box Office and similar networks The report contended that `` facing the challenge requires hard-nosed pragmatism, not moralizing.'' `` Our own country pirated <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s intellectual property a century ago, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was a young country. New, developing countries have short-term incentives to be ` free riders' on the creativity of other nations `` Permitting piracy is not, however, in the long-term interest of countries that wish to develop their own economies and innovative potential,'' it said. `` Free-riding deprives them of an important incentive for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.'' Policy options the panel suggested include stiffer criminal penalties, improved enforcement of intellectual property laws abroad and better coordination of activities by federal agencies dealing with intellectual property matters. Last May, seven nations identified by the Washington-base <ORGANIZATION> Intellectual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> as `` problem countries'' due to pervasive piracy were named to a `` priority watch list'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Hills. The seven countries are <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Four other nations considered `` problem countries'' by the alliance were named to the trade representative's longer `` watch list.'' These are <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Intellectual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, the 11 countries together accounted for estimated piracy losses to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies of almost $ 1.4 billion in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1983 to assess how communications technologies and current public policies on communications affect aspects of American life including education, medicine, law, politics, foreign policy and financial markets.

 Radical students held anti-American rallies and fought police in three cities Friday after compatriots rampaged through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence at dawn. Ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife escaped through a side door minutes after six invaders with homemade bombs, tear gas grenades and steel pipes stormed the residence and began smashing artworks, lamps and pottery. Police used tear gas to overpower the students, described by officials as an `` anti-U.S. death squad.'' They shouted `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' while being dragged away. They protested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to lower trade barriers and demanded that President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo cancel a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scheduled for next week. About 2,000 radical students protested or fought police later Friday on at least 11 campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Police reported two dozen arrests. Hundreds of protesters at <LOCATION> Konkuk </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kyunghee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police, who responded with tear gas. The students burned American flgags and effigies of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Meg </PERSON>, were sleeping when the students stormed the house. The ambassador said he did not see the students but could hear them on the other side of the locked bedroom door. `` I never saw any of them,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We heard shouting in <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION>. ... I do n't know what they were shouting.'' He said the living room, where the damage was done, is 50 to 60 feet from the bedroom. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said the attack would not affect U.S.-Korean relations. `` This is the act of six people who broke into our home and I do n't put a larger signifiance on it than that,'' he said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called the rampage a `` senseless riot'' and leading opposition parties denounced it. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said there had been a security problem at the residence, but would not elaborate. They said they security procedures would be reviewed. Security for the residences is handled by a private firm under contract and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> are not posted there, the officials said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, said: `` Incidents of this type represent misguided actions of only a small minority... I continue to believe that a strong U.S.-South Korean partnership is in the interest of both nations.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, the fomer <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, became ambassador last month and radical students have been protesting since. They claim he was sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to impose military rule. Police officials, who would not let their names be used, said the students used homemade bombs to distract police, then scaled the wall of the residence compound and hurled tear gas grenades at security guards who tried to stop them. Once inside, the raiders blocked the main door with chairs and sprayed the floor with paint thinner, threatening to ignite it if police attacked, and threw more of the homemade bombs at police, the officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats described the devices as `` firecracker-like noise bombs,'' used in other attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and military facilities, which make a loud bang but cause little damage. At least one student was draped in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> flag and all shouted `` Punish <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>!'' and `` We oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure!'' Authorities said one student was slightly injured in a scuffle and police were seeking four others who helped the invaders enter the compound. The Party for <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the main political opposition, said it regretted the assault, but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should note that excessive trade pressure feeds anti-American feeling in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radical students are a small but influential minority on college campuses, but have little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views.

<HEAD>Italian Designers Offer Choice in Spring-Summer Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The woman who dresses Italian style for next spring and summer can be anything she wants to be. The new look offered by more than 40 top Italian designers, who presented their warm weather wears this week, is both sexy and demure, sporty and urbane, tailored and languid, colorful and muted, simple and ornate. There is less of a unified message than in past `` moda Milanese'' seasons, allowing the fashionable woman, as <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> put it, `` to choose something which seems to be designed for her alone.'' Naturally there are trends. The new style concentrates on the upper body, with the bare midriff the newest look. Bra tops bandeaus and bustiers, as well as an accent on see-through blouses, spell bad news for the lingerie industry. The bra as an undergarment virtually disappears. Color is another novelty on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway. After many a season of drab shades, the designers have burst out in a bright palette of Italian fruit ice cream tones: raspberry, kiwi, watermelon, mango, apricot, peach, banana, blueberry and many more. In some of the collections these shades are in muted pastels. Black also plays a big role by night. Short skirts no longer make news in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, with the young and old _ stout and slim alike _ showing off their legs. It is no surprise that short skirts continue to dominate the runway. Next season's miniskirt is not as hip-hugging as the winter version with a preference for draping and tie skirts, like the ones worn by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> island natives. There is little for city dwellers and working women in the new collections with the emphasis on holiday attire: shorts, jumpsuits, gaily printed sun dresses, pajama pants and loose shirt jackets. Where detailing is concerned the Milanese designers are on a fringe binge with long silk threads adorning shawls and scarves, as well as finding there way onto shirts, jackets, and the hemlines of skirts. Gold and crystal beading dot all the collections especially for evening. Simple chiffon gowns and camisole tops are richly embroidered with opulent sequining, all done now in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Gone are the famous Italian seamstresses who used to work out of their homes by candle light to embellish Italian couture. Ornate jewelry is back for the summer of 1990, with over-sized gold bracelets, necklaces and earrings by day and night. Face-painting is out next season with a return for the natural look not only in the make-up but also in the short boyish hairstyles. Footwear is predominantly casual and flat even for evening. Americans are spending more cautiously, but the Italians are comforted by a Japanese market, which almost doubled the number of buyers it sent to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Modenese </PERSON>, the organizational mastermind behind the `` moda Milanese,'' which swept the fashion world at the beginning of the 1980s, is confident that despite recent defections by Italian designers to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON> has joined <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> in showing his ready-to-wear collection in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> now designs for Dior as well as doing his own label out of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> will continue to be a guiding light in the 1990s. `` We are still the reference point for all ready to wear. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and even <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> take their cue from us,'' <PERSON> Modenese </PERSON> said. Highlights from the shows: <ORGANIZATION> Versace </ORGANIZATION> _ The sexiest, most theatrical look with super short skirts and multicolored gold and crystal encrusted bustier tops. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> _ The most confident look with enormous scarf tie blouses and a see-through jumpusit made of bands of silk jersey and skin-color chiffon. <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> _ The award for the longest show _ one hour and 10 minutes _ and the clumpiest shoes, 1940s platform ankle straps. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> _ The longest, loosest jacket in raw silk, and the most elegant collection. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> _ The only collection to dress working women. Byblos _ The easiest collection to sell, full of young and pretty clothes. <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON> _ Always the best where cashmere is concerned. <LOCATION> Missoni </LOCATION> _ Superb quilted and knitted reversible jackets. Moschino _ The best sense of humor. He stitches his labels on the outside, poking fun at himself.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Anew for Noriega Ouster, `Wouldn't Mind Force'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a new call Friday for the overthrow of Panamanian ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying `` I would n't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner.'' But he emphasized he was not offering a blanket commitment of American troops. Ten days after an uprising against the Panamanian general was crushed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vigorously defended his handling of the situation, rejecting criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike over his refusal to provide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance. He seemed particularly disturbed by charges that he abandoned the rebels, leaving them on their own after publicly exhorting the Panamanian military to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that was `` a stupid argument that some very erudite people make.'' At a hurriedly called news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also addressed politically charged issues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said: _ He opposes federal funding of abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest but holds out hopes for a congressional compromise that would `` avoid a veto on my part.'' He said he would `` see if there is room for flexibility'' when <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators work out a compromise version of a bill that now would allow such federal payments. _ He will permit a bill outlawing flag burning to become law without his signature. `` I do n't think it's enough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, renewing his call for a constitutional amendment along the same lines but adding that he would not veto the legislation in the meantime. _ He still wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve his plan for a cut in the capital gains tax, and he did not rule out the possibility of signing legislation that combined his proposal with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> version liberalizing individual retirement accounts. A few hours later, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed on a plan to strip hundreds of special-interest provisions from a $ 14.1 billion deficit-reduction bill, leaving the capital gains fight for the future. Asked about attempts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal catastrophic health care legislation for the elderly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made clear he was staying away from that controversial topic, preferring instead to let `` the congressional process hash this out.'' As for a possible future coup against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I hope I would never be reckless enough as a commander-in-chief to make a blanket commitment to use of force without knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt.'' On the other hand, the president said, `` I would n't mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner. So, in other words, I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I am not going to give carte blanche support to an operation, particularly when they do n't ask for this support. And I have to reserve that right. I have at stake the lives of American kids and I am not going to easily thrust them into a battle unless I feel comfortable with it and unless those general officers in whom I have total confidence feel comfortable.'' He rejected the idea of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> giving up power in return for dismissal of drug-trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a possibility that a reporter suggested had been raised with the president. `` It would send an impossible signal in this fight against drugs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. While defending his handling of the coup attempt, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the administration was reviewing procedures to see `` if we ca n't do it better.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, widow of the coup leader, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's cautious attitude toward coup leaders had stalled vital aid at a key moment. In particular, she said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were slow to react when one of the plotters tried to use a telephone number that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had provided for use in an emergency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to look into her complaint. `` To the degree we can improve our communications, fine,'' he said. As a result of an internal review, the administration has decided that a crisis-management team will be automatically convened in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> situation room in future emergencies, a senior official said. Representatives of such agencies as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be summoned to coordinate the flow of information, the official said, insisting on anonymity. Hinting that he may seek congressional approval for greater authority in dealing with situations like the coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I want as broad a power as possible and I think under the Constitution the president has it.'' Although some members of his administration have faulted the way the coup was handled, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted there was no second-guessing and `` all of them are singing from the same sheet of music.'' He said of his staff, `` they all did a good job.''

<HEAD>Army Hospital Ordered to Spare Greyhounds in Leg-Breaking Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nineteen greyhounds were released by an Army hospital ordered to halt research that would have involved breaking the dogs' hind legs. <ORGANIZATION> Letterman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> agreed to release the dogs Thursday after an animal rights group won the court order. The order also forces the Army to confirm whether the former owners of the dogs had knowingly given them up for research. The dogs were released to the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and will be reunited with former owners or offered for adoption. The hospital acquired the dogs for $ 300 each from a middleman and had intended to use them in research on healing broken bones because greyhounds are a docile, stoic breed that can endure pain without turning mean. A hospital worker upset by the experiment alerted the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which notified the In <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> group and other animal-rights organizations. The experiment called for removing three inches of bone from a hind leg of each dog and replacing the missing section with a new synthetic material designed for bone replacement. The dogs were to be killed and the broken legs saved for testing of the new material.

 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks chanted and prayed Friday to welcome the completion of a smiling bronze <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> half the height of the Statue of Liberty that sits cross-legged on a hill outside <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, facing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Publicity material claims the 134-foot-tall, $ 7.7 million statue is the world's tallest bronze <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> in the open air. It was made from bronze crafted in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The 250-ton statue sits next to the Po Lin Monastery on the outlying <LOCATION> Lantao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a one-hour ferry ride from downtown <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` You can definitely see it from a plane,'' said architect <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, which is about half the height of the 305-foot Statue of Liberty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. In a rain-soaked ceremony, a crane placed part of the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s head on top the statue while chanting monks circled it, blessing the guests The statue is the brainchild of <PERSON> Sik </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>, 56, the monastery's director who has lived there since he was 3 `` I ate the monks' meals and have to do something for the monastery,'' said <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>. He said that after viewing <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> statues in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, he asked himself: `` If they can do it, why ca n't we? `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is such a prosperous place, we also need some kind of religious symbol,'' he said. `` Lantao is a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> holy land and I think we can build it here.'' The <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> sits on a base that resembles a circular altar of the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavenly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He faces northeast, overlooking the monastery and, further out, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wai </PERSON> said there is no political relevance to the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s facing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which takes over this British colony in eight years. `` We consulted a <PERSON> Fung </PERSON> <PERSON> Shui </PERSON> expert who said the direction would give the greatest blessing to those who donated and supported the construction of the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>,'' he explained. The project was funded by donors in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, many of whom will have their names and pictures placed on the walls of a memorial hall at the statue's base. About $ 7.1 million was raised in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> through the sale of commemorative cards, bronze coins, and bronze <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> figurines. The rest was raised by Buddhists in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Sitting atop the 1,591-foot Muk Yu -LRB- Wooden Fish -RRB- <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the statue consists of 222 bronze pieces made by the <ORGANIZATION> Nanjing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chengguang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They have been assembled on the island over the past three years. The <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> includes many symbols, said <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wai </PERSON>. His half-open eyes signals he is looking after the ordinary people. His right hand, half raised, symbolizes the easing of pain on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. His left hand rests on his lap with his palm facing out, a sign of giving away happiness. <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wai </PERSON> believes his <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> has no rival. `` Ours is better because it is taller, looks kinder and more peaceful,'' he said. <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wai </PERSON> denied the project was an attempt to attract more tourists to the island, already filled on weekends with vacationers. `` A <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> saying goes: ` When you are confused, go into a temple or tower. Once you say a prayer you will feel the truth of Buddhism,''' he said. `` It means a religious person can feel the tranquility once they see the statue. A non-religious person can also observe this work of art,'' he said.

<HEAD>Syria, Power Sharing Come Up Again In Lebanon Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHEHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New arguments over Christian-Moslem power sharing and a timetable for <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troop withdrawal dimmed hopes Friday that Lebanese legislators had found a formula for ending their country's 14-year civil war. A meeting to put the finishing touches on a tentative agreement was postponed repeatedly. Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> foreign minister, met with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saddeh </PERSON>, a Christian member of the parliamentary committee who stormed out of a meeting Thursday night. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a Lebanese deputy, said the two agreed `` on a unified formula on the issues that caused the postponement.'' He would not give details, but said the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was not discussed. Conference sources said they expected a full meeting Saturday of the 63 legislators, who must approve any agreement reached by the 17-member negotiating committee. <PERSON> Saddeh </PERSON>, who leads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accused Moslems on Thursday of making `` crippling demands.'' He did not specify the demands, but sent a note to the press center saying `` they affect intrinsic issues'' and `` can not be accepted under any circumstances.'' According to the sources, Syrian-backed Moslem legislators insisted on greater political concessions by the Christians, who made their own demands about <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> withdrawal. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, one year after the outbreak of a sectarian civil war that has cost more than 150,000 lives. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander, has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out. Artillery battles between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and a Moslem alliance led by the Syrians, which began March 8, killed more than 900 people and wounded nearly 3,000 before an Arab League cease-fire took effect Sept. 22 and the legislators met in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> to seek a solution. Lebanese sources said <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> walked out Thursday night as Sunni and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem lawmakers argued over the powers of the parliament speaker, traditionally a Shiite. They said deputies held side consultations Friday in an effort to head off further disagreement. On Thursday, conference sources said the committee had reached preliminary agreement on a `` national reconciliation charter'' and would meet Friday to complete the document. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> a few hours later that the deliberations were irrelevant and he would continue his war on the Syrians. `` We can not rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying force,'' he declared. As-Safir, a leftist <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s remarks amounted to a `` public and direct threat'' to Christian legislators in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> against making major political concessions without guarantees of a swift Syrian withdrawal. Sources gave no details of the tentative accord, which must be approved by all 63 legislators attending the Taif meeting. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations close to the factions said it included a `` limited and phased'' Syrian withdrawal and political reforms that reduce the president's power. Under an unwritten covenant observed since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, the president is Christian the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite. The Arab League peace plan, on which the cease-fire is based, envisages gradual abolition of sectarianism and Syrian withdrawal to eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within two years while law and order is restored and militias disbanded. Christians demand complete Syrian withdrawal within two months and Moslems want an equal share of political power, which the Christians say they wo n't allow without guarantees about the pullout. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christians were the majority in 1943 and have dominated the government, parliament, judiciary and army. Moslems make up 55 percent of the 4 million people and demand more power.

<HEAD>Business Leaders See Recession Unless Interest Rates Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic growth in 1990 will slump to its slowest pace in eight years with an outright recession a distinct threat unless the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> lowers interest rates, the nation's top business executives forecast Friday. The Business Council, composed of the chief executives of 100 of the country's largest corporations, said that the economy began to lose steam this summer. They predicted that the sluggish period will last through much of next year. The forecast said, however, that a timely assist from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could make the slowdown the `` pause that refreshes'' and lead to a rebound in growth in 1991. That would give the country an unprecedented nine consecutive years without a recession. The study, prepared by a panel of top corporate economists, predicted that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand at a 2.9 percent rate this year, identical to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's forecast. For 1990, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said growth will slump to an anemic 1.8 percent annual rate, the slowest pace since the recession year of 1982. This prediction is significantly below the administration's outlook for growth of 2.3 percent next year and would represent a blow to Republican hopes for reasonably robust growth to boost their chances in the 1990 congressional races `` There are a variety of potential weaknesses in the economy that carry the risk of a recession,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the large <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank. `` f I were the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, I would be inclined to lean in the direction of an easier policy. My sense is that we will need a fair amount of insurance against trouble.'' The administration has also been pushing the central bank to lower interest rates as a way of making <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports more competitive overseas. Lower interest rates in this country make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners and thus lower the value of the dollar. However, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has given no indication that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to loosen credit anytime soon and in fact the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is still sending signals that it is worried about inflationary pressures. The government reported Friday that inflation at the wholesale level shot up 0.9 percent in September. Many of the business executives, however, dismissed the inflation report as a temporary blip that did nothing to change their view that recession and not inflation was the bigger threat facing the economy at the present time. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has done a good job in holding inflation in check following a spurt in prices earlier this year `` but now is the time to bring interest rates down.'' The business executives forecast that inflation will show further moderation with the consumer price index rising at annual rates of 4.5 percent or less over the next two years. The business chiefs were also optimistic that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports will remain strong over the next two years, helping to drive the merchandise trade deficit down to $ 100 billion next The growth in exports was based on a belief that strong growth in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will spur continued demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods even with the rise in the value of the dollar this year. The forecast was released on the opening day of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting at a mountain resort in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Despite the outlook for a significant slowdown in growth and the fact that corporate profits have already begun to sag, the business executives were generally optimistic about their prospects in the coming year. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto sales should be above 15 million units for the sixth consecutive year despite the projections of `` doomsayers'' to the contrary. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, who spoke to the executives during a closed-door session, told reporters afterward that reports of a dispute between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had been blown out of proportion. He said that only `` very minor differences'' existed between the two over such issues as interest rate policy.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he will not veto a law to outlaw flag-burning even though he will continue trying to amend the Constitution as a stronger way to accomplish the same end. `` I do n't think it's enough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the flag legislation. He said he will allow the newly passed bill to become law automatically without his signature, but added he does not think the law will withstand legal challenges. `` I'm withholding that signature to signal our belief that a constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting protection for the flag,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at a brief White House news conference. A firestorm of controversy regarding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag arose after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> conviction last June, ruling that protesters could legally burn the flag under constitutional free-speech guarantees. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a new constitutional amendment against flag desecration, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chose to deal with the matter through legislation rather than changing the Constitution. The legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> put the president in a politically prickly position. In vetoing it, he might have risked being seen as throwing out a pro-flag bird in the hand just for the chance to push <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a constitutional amendment that would be harder to get approved. He also found himself in a situation similar to his Democratic presidential opponent from last year, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who vetoed flag legislation on grounds it was unconstitutional. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was scathingly criticized by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for rejecting the legislation, which would have required public schools teachers in the state to lead pupils in daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. Legislation becomes law automatically if the president does not act on it within 10 working days of when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sends it to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in recess. Then a president can pocket-veto bills by refusing to sign them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his decision to let it become law was not politically motivated. `` I do n't want to set the clock way back and rule out the legislation, even though I do n't think it's enough,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeated his contention that the new federal legislation will not survive court challenges. `` I can understand the rationale of those who voted for this legislation, but in my view, it is not the ultimate answer,'' he said. He called the flag `` a unique and special symbol of our nation and it should be protected from desecration.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the congressional vote was `` an overwhelming expression on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do something about the protection of the flag.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 317-43 Thursday to complete congressional action on the bill. The measure requires up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for anyone who `` knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is set next week to take up a constitutional amendment measure geared toward protecting the flag.

 The government Friday issued rules states must follow in setting up required education, job training and work programs to help welfare recipients become self-sufficient. The rules implement the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training program, a $ 3.7 billion, five-year initiative passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year. It was the first major welfare overhaul in more than half a century. `` This final rule recognizes that parents must work toward self-sufficiency and government must support their efforts,'' said <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. All states must have a JOBS program approved by the federal government no later than Oct. 1, 1990. Twenty-five states that have begun their programs must have them re-approved to assure they comply, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a Family Support Administration spokesman. States, whose progam funding will be matched by the federal government, initially will have to bring 7 percent of their caseload in Aid to Families with Dependent Children programs under the new plan, and by 1994 will be required to have 20 percent in the program. About 3.7 million families receive AFDC, the nation's largest cash assistance program costing about $ 8.5 billion a year. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> estimates that up to 138,000 families will be able to leave the welfare rolls over the first five years of the JOBS program. The plan requires that one parent in two-parent welfare families to work at least 16 hours a week as a condition for receiving benefits. Single welfare parents with children 3 years or older must participate in employment and training programs, and teen-age parents who have not finished high school will be required to return to school or work toward an equivalent degree. States must guarantee child care for parents who participate in the education and training programs. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the state human services agencies that will implement the programs, said the rules give states more flexibility than did the government's initial proposal. `` We're pleased they listened to some of the comments the states made,'' she said. However, she said the association's evaluation was based only on a briefing by officials at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and that some of the regulations present concerns. One such concern is that the rules may impose an overly stringent cap on funds for child care.

Shvartze is a Yiddish term for blacks that is generally derogatory. `` I think that he's in no way racially prejudiced, and that he was just joking, and these are the same jokes that he's always made, and that the press was pious and foolish and, you know, that he got a raw deal,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, star of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Chicken Soup.'' `` He was just joking in the same style that he always jokes,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Shvartze'' could be pejorative, he said, but `` I do n't think it's pejorative in this case.'' He also defended <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s suggestion that Jews would vote for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> out of guilt. `` I do n't know whether it's Jews or blacks, but I think that people make decisions out of guilt as a motivation.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> stood by as <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> spoke to reporters at the $ 1,000-a-head fund-raiser at the home of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Krim </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. The smile left his face and he replied curtly: `` I've made all the comments I intend to make on that subject. `` Frankly, I would prefer to talk about crime and drugs and housing and homelessness. And I would hope that I could somehow or other interest the media in these issues as well,'' he said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he had met <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> once, for only 30 seconds. A former stand-up comic himself, the director featured a gaggle of Borsht belt gagmen similar to <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> in his film `` Broadway <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>.'' Another comedian, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>, made a face when asked about <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s comments in a USA Today interview. `` I think <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s remarks are <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>'s remarks,'' he said He did say he thought <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> should have known better, and he adapted a basic rule of stand-up comedy to apply to politics: `` If you're going to be a spokesperson, know the room.''

<HEAD>For Thatcher, Applause &amp; Beatles Music, But Inflation Jumps Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> defended her economic strategy Friday, but a jump in inflation to 7.6 percent took some of the gloss off a rousing speech winding up the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference. `` When the choice is between high -LRB- interest -RRB- rates now or persistent higher inflation later, with all the damage that would do, the choice is clear,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economy is strong. When inflation is beaten ... <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will be stronger still.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who turned 64 on Friday, received a rapturous ovation from the 9,000 party activists packed into conference hall in this north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> resort. She hailed 1989 `` as the year when the people of half our continent began to throw off their chains,'' adding, `` We did n't know it at the time but the torch we lit in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which transformed our country _ the torch of freedom that is now the symbol of our party _ became a beacon that has shed its light across the Iron Curtain into the East. Delegates tapped their feet to the strains of the Beatles' classic `` When I'm 64,'' and after the keynote speech sang `` Happy Birthday'' and burst into the favorite Tory anthem, `` Land of Hope and Glory. They waved huge blue <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> banners and chanted `` 10 more years'' as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> made her way out of the ballroom. Despite the razzmatazz, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who came to power in 1979 and won a third five-year term in 1987, ended the convention with her party in trouble. Fears of an economic recession have combined with unpopular plans for a new property tax and privatization of the water and electricity industries to depress Tory fortunes. `` After 10 years in government, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is facing her toughest test,'' commented the respected weekly, The Economist, which usually supports the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> made no direct reference to the Conservatives' slumping popularity, now an average 7 points behind the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> But she said inflation was too high and acknowledged that soaring interest rates _ doubled to 15 percent in the past 16 months _ were hitting businesses and millions of home-buyers. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the government announced that the annual inflation rate has risen to 7.6 percent from 7.3 percent, which was already among the highest in industrialized countries. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, surging ahead on a new, more moderate platform, was `` seeking power at any price and they'll say anything to get it.'' `` Labor's real prescription for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the disease half the world is struggling to cure,'' she added, referring to reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and protests against <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hardline communist rulers. Labor last month ditched its policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> dismissed the action as `` no more than a confidence trick.'' `` It's still unilateral disarmament _ unilateral disarmament by agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` That is n't a defense policy to see <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> through the 1990s. Its a form of words to see Labor through the next election.'' She took a few cracks at critics of her rigorous tight-money brand of conservatism, including academics and some church leaders. `` I went to <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but I've never let it hold me back,'' she said of the ancient university which in 1985 voted against giving her an honorary doctorate in protest at cuts state grants. The four-day convention was overshadowed by economic problems. Inflation, fuelled by a booming credit, began to take off again last year. The government is using high interest rates as the sole means of trying both to curb inflation and defend the value of the pound. Pressure is mounting from right and left _ big business, trade unions and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to speed up British entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. It is links the currencies of most of the 12-member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The issue has divided Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has set stringent conditions for entry, and Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. Critics charge that the differences mean the government lacks a coherent economic strategy. During the conference, there were also signs of unease that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s combative style is not working any more. Some top <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> say privately they also fear that she will not be able to pull the economy around before the next election, which must be held by mid-1992.

 Mental retardation is rising among Soviet children because of worsening alcoholism among parents, a newspaper said Friday in the latest media revelation on how children suffer for Soviet society's ills. One special education school in the southern <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Oryol </LOCATION> has seen the number of retarded children it serves more than quintuple during a period when the city's population only doubled, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper attributed the rising retardation rate to the intractable alcoholism that drives Soviets to make bootleg liquor and drink everything from after-shave lotion to insect repellent. Other recent Soviet media reports have focused on baldness, deformities and diseases in children living in polluted areas and on the terrible toll radiation has taken on babies on the <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION> peninsula in the Soviet northeast. `` Infant mortality remains high'' in the entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Pravda reported Friday, and allergies, cancer and heart disease are increasing because of pollution. More than 90 children were reported to have lost their hair this year in towns near the shale-oil fields in the Baltic coast of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> due to an ailment apparently caused by the dirty environment. Other outbreaks of child baldness were reported in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION>, which lies across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, nuclear tests carried out decades ago have left such a high level of radiation that the cancer rate there is 2-3 times higher than the national average and infant mortality can reach up to 100 deaths per 1,000 infants, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News reported this summer. The people of northern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> are considered to be living in some of the country's worst conditions, with pollution widespread and shortages especially extreme.

 Attackers hurled firebombs into the home of an opposition figure from neighboring <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> on Friday and killed seven people, police said, but the apparent target of the attack was not in the house. Four of the victims were children ranging in age from two months to eight years, police said. Five people were injured, including the owner of the house, <PERSON> Mkwapatira </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON> is secretary of publicity and information of the <ORGANIZATION> Malawi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or Mafremo, which opposes the government of <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Kamuzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Banda </PERSON>. He said the apparent target of the firebombing was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirwa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mafremo </PERSON>'s chairman, who had been visiting <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and staying with <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON>. `` This must have been politically motivated from <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON>, who was hospitalized with severe burns. `` Dr. <PERSON> Chirwa </PERSON> was here on a private visit and not to hatch a plot against the Malawian government,'' <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Chirwa </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> a few days ago. An official at the <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> High Commission, or embassy, said the <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> government would never countenance state terrorism. The official refused to be identified. <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON>'s two wives, three of their children, and a visiting Malawian woman and her baby were killed in the attack in the working-class suburb of <LOCATION> Kamwala </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON>'s four other children were hospitalized with severe burns, nurses said. They said <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON>'s condition was satisfactory. Police said the gang first hurled rocks through the windows of the house and then flaming firebombs. The victims suffocated or died in the blaze that destroyed most of the bungalow. Police spokesman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkole </PERSON> said a motive had not been established and no one was under arrest. <PERSON> Mhango </PERSON> has been living in exile in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> for many years. He distributes propaganda against <PERSON> Banda </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Banda </PERSON> led the British colony of <LOCATION> Nyasaland </LOCATION> to independence as <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> in 1964. All opposition parties in his tiny southern African nation are outlawed, an undisclosed number of opponents are in detention, and thousands more have fled the country. <PERSON> Banda </PERSON> declared himself president for life in 1971, and he has survived several assassination attempts. <PERSON> Mafremo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malawi </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the Second Republic are opposition movements that have sprung up over the years and pledged to topple <PERSON> Banda </PERSON> and restore democracy.

 Computer experts received scattered reports today of computer viruses that had struck unsuspecting users on Friday the 13th, even as they cautioned that fears of widespread damage were overblown. An institute for the blind in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was among the victims, although it apparently was infected with a previously known virus, not the so-called Columbus Day virus that was seen for the first time when it was activated by computers' internal clocks at 12:01 today. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, a security specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and creator of the Flu-Shot Plus and Virex-PC anti-viral software, said at midmorning that he had received seven reports of virus strikes since midnight, but only one was the Columbus Day virus. He said 12 personal computers at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were affected, but that the university had made backup files and was merely inconvenienced. Several officials at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> today said they were unable to confirm the report, and <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> acknowledged the information was not first-hand. The other six virus reports <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> received were of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> virus, an older virus designed to erase programs every Friday the 13th. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> had said earlier that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> virus was far more widespread and likely to cause more trouble today than the new Columbus Day virus. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> for the Blind reported that it was struck by a virus. `` We found that most of our program files are gone. Every time we try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of our eyes,'' said <PERSON> Corri </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> of the institute in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It's horrendous Months and months of work has been wiped out here.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said in a BBC-TV interview that the virus might have contaminated disks distributed to blind clients and that their systems had been infected. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said the virus was almost certainly the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> virus. The Columbus Day virus, also called the Datacrime virus, does not erase files but is programmed to scramble indexing information in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> or IBM-compatible personal computers. It would be the equivalent of removing a library's card catalog. Computer viruses, created by anonymous programmers, are pieces of software that make copies of themselves and spread from one machine to another through infected floppy disks, office networks or phone links such as computer bulletin boards. Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breeding germ, eating away processing power and storage space or destroying information. About 30 viruses are known to exist, not counting strains and mutations. Fears of a virus could be beneficial if they get people to `` think of making backup files as readily as they think of wearing seat belts,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, receptionist at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s regional marketing and service center in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said he had received no reports of a virus infection with the company's equipment or from area customers this morning. `` Usually if anything like that happens, we get a message, and I have n't seen a thing,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, head of the federal personal computer team, said several dozen of the government's 3,500 personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus but that experts managed to cancel and reprogram all infected programs. He said infected programs had been found in a wide range of administrative branches. The <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Portuguese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was informed of two viral outbreaks today, but they were both strains that appeared previously. A leading bank and a medium-size industrial concern were affected, <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not identify the companies. Last November, a virus spread through a computer network shared by colleges, research centers and the military. It took several days to cleanse the 60,000 computers in the network affected by the virus, which had multiplied out of control, overloading the memories of the computer systems it invaded. Since March, a dozen cases of the Columbus Day virus have been found dormant in computers when people noticed that some of their files had swollen inexplicably. Infected programs were turned over to experts who dismantled the virus and found out when it would be triggered. `` We want to send a calming message to people that if they take reasonable precautions, this virus poses no more danger than any other,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malarkey </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Said <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>: `` All the people I consider to be respectable in the anti-virus community have a similar opinion to mine, that the Datacrime virus has been blown way out of proportion by an unknowledgeable media.''

 Despite a sharp increase in the number of arrests and plants destroyed, the size of the marijuana crop growing illegally in national forests will probably remain the same for the next several years, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The report also said that `` organized networks'' of growers and distributors now control more than half of the marijuana crop in the national forests and the number of clandestine drug labs, most producing methamphetamines, remains a serious problem. The report was released by Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. and the successful sponsor of legislation last year giving the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> increased powers to deal with drug problems in the federal forests <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said he would ask <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the presidential drug policy coordinator, next week to form a `` strike force'' to spearhead the war on the drug networks operating in the national forests. `` In the 1988 drug act, we told the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ` go get'em,''' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said `` This report shows how well they've done. But they're catching the equivalent of serfs and peasants. They must now catch the lords who direct forest crime.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in the report that it expected to be `` faced with a continuing drug production challenge in the national forest system for the foreseeable future.'' The report, recounting figures that had largely been released previously, said: _ Almost 415,000 marijuana plants were eradicated in the national forests in 1988, an 84 percent increase over the 254,950 plants destroyed in 1987 _ Law enforcement personel made 543 arrests in 1988, up roughly 300 percent over the 135 arrests in 1987 _ Areas in the national forests considered `` unsafe'' because of marijuana crops that could be booby-trapped or armed growers defending their plants fell about 50 percent, from 772,600 acres in 1987 to 388,800 acres in 1988 _ Some 116 booby-traps were found in 1988 compared with 83 in 1987; the number of weapons seized grew from 101 to 271, and the number of drug-related assaults dropped from 19 to 11 Preliminary estimates for the first nine months of 1989 suggest that the number of arrests and plants destroyed this year will exceed last year's totals, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Our analysis of these trends suggest that despite increased eradication and apprehension effectiveness the total volume of cannabis produced in the national forest system may remain about the same for the next several years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Roughly two-thirds of the cannabis sites found and half the plants eradicated in 1988 were in the national forests of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, the report said. The <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> National Forest in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, because of its nearness to urban markets in the East and the depressed local economy, accounted for almost 25 percent of the cannabis eradicated throughout the national forest system in 1988, the report said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of flag legislation he did n't want but did n't dare veto demonstrates anew his understanding of the red, white and blue politics he used so effectively against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the 1988 presidential campaign. Veto a bill that makes it a crime to desecrate the flag? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not about to fall into the legalistic trap that ensnared <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when he vetoed legislation to require recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. Then was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ready to sign the flag bill into law? Not exactly. This president, who is raising the art of compromise to new levels, took a different tack. He suggested he did n't dislike the legislation enough to veto it; he did n't like it enough to sign it. `` I will allow the bill to become law without my signature,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who vowed to continue pressing for a constitutional amendment. It was a graphic reminder of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 campaign stand that he would have found a way to require teachers to lead pupils in the Pledge of Allegiance. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, there was no compromise when confronted with legislation he believed violated the Constitution. He saw his choice as sign or veto; his duty as veto. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rarely sees things in such stark terms, even an issue that he pursues with as much fervor as protecting the flag. The bill sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would mandate up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for anyone who `` knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Many critics believe the bill will not pass review by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never has publicly addressed the issue of its constitutionality. It moved through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> swiftly, completing its legislative journey with a 317-to-34 vote Thursday in the House. After the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that flag-burning was a constitutionally protected form of free speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was among the first to call for amending the Constitution to permit <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the states to make such behavior illegal. He stood before the Iwo Jima memorial, a statue depicting Marines raising the flag on that bloody World War II battleground, to declare his support for an amendment and his belief it was an issue that `` transcends politics and patriotism.'' But the politics of the moment were unmistakable. While congressional Democrats balked at amending the Constitution, they had learned the lessons of the 1988 presidential campaign. `` Before we amend the Constitution we should approach the question with a statutory change,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. The Democrats rushed to draft legislation to protect the flag without changing the Constitution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> termed their efforts `` inadequate'' but he steered clear of making the debate a partisan fight. `` I do n't have disrespect for those who want to find a different answer,'' was his response when asked to comment on the legislative effort. While <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> echoed the president's statements about keeping the debate above politics, the Democrats had to get some satisfaction out of putting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the position of opposing their flag protection bill. But they had little hope <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would react the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did to the Pledge of Allegiance bill passed by the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislature during his first term as governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed that bill because he believed it was unconstitutional to require public school teachers to lead pupils in daily recitation of the Pledge and he never seemed to comprehend why people did n't agree with his view of his clear duty in that case. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put the issue this way: `` Should public school teachers be required to lead our children in the Pledge of Allegiance? My opponent says no _ but I say yes.'' He closed that speech by asking `` everyone in this great hall to stand and join me'' as he recited the Pledge of Allegiance.

 Blacks planned 17 rallies across the country Saturday to celebrate the imminent release of eight major anti-apartheid leaders, including seven jailed for a quarter-century. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and at least four of his jailed colleagues were flown Friday from their <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> prison to their hometown of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, according to airline personnel. The men were immediately taken to Diepkloof Prison outside the city and near the huge <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township, according to various reports. Another prisoner, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, was flown from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to his hometown, the southern city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. The white-run government announced Tuesday that the eight, ranging in age from 60 to 80, would be freed unconditionally. Officials have refused to say when or where the men will be released. Some _ if not all _ were expected to be freed over the weekend. Seven of the men are ranking <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members and <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, is the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawed guerrilla movement after <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release has not yet been approved but is widely expected in the next few months. The eighth, <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON>, belongs to a smaller black nationalist guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The decision by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to release the activists has generally won high praise, both in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and abroad. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who became president in August, says he wants to end racial discrimination and negotiate a new constitution that will bring the black majority into the national government. However, almost all black political leaders have said they will not negotiate with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> until the government makes several concessions, including the release of political prisoners. Anti-apartheid leaders applied to magistrates to hold `` victory marches'' in cities and towns across the country Saturday to celebrate the releases. The New Nation, a militant opposition newspaper, said at least 250,000 people were expected to take part. Police Friday lifted restrictions on <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON>, who had been banned from meetings and making public statements since February 1988. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a prominent activist in her own right, told reporters at her <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> home she would join the planned march in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Journalists and residents waited outside her house for much of the day, and police used tear gas to disperse a group of youths dancing in the street Friday evening. One young girl was injured and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> had one of its video cassettes confiscated, witnesses said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said she received some political advice from <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> on Tuesday, when she and other activists met with him at his prison quarters near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` Now that there are less limitations on my activities, I will be able to push ahead with the suggestions and advice given to me by <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>,'' she said without elaborating. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> is co-president of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition. Despite her restrictions, Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 71, was issued a short-term passport by the government this year. She and other anti-apartheid leaders met President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and officials of other Western governments. In addition to <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, four of the other prisoners to be freed were sentenced to life in prison _ along with <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> _ at the <LOCATION> Rivonia </LOCATION> treason trial in 1964. They are <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsoaledi </PERSON>, 65; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlengi </PERSON>, 63; and <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 69. Also to be freed are <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, 80, and <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, 67, and <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON>, 60. All have been imprisoned for 25 years except the ailing <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, who is nearing the end of a five-year term. When they are released, the seven <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members are expected to seek permission to travel to the group's headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> A leading official of the guerrilla movement said the release of the political prisoners shows international pressure is working. <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, the group's secretary for international affairs, said he did not believe the release was a sign of a new spirit of conciliation on <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s part. `` I think it's a response to pressure,'' he said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it signifies that this regime of de Klerk is any different from the regime of P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> except that the pressures have become so much that it has to yield ground.''

<TEXT>
 A year-long austerity program achieved some success in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but failed to solve serious defects in state planning, a report published Friday shows. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said food retail prices had not risen since December, but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, in a survey of 28 major cities, found that more than $ 270 million was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies, and another $ 54 million for vegetables. The daily quoted experts as saying the growing subsidies will cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable.'' That will cut the amount of funds available for investment. The austerity program was imposed last fall, when the government cut off credit to companies outside the state plan, suspended new building projects, cut public spending and reasserted central controls over key industries and trade. Conservatives solidified their control after the June military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. They support central planning, are reluctant to tackle economic reforms and stress public ownership. The lot of small industries and private businessmen has become increasingly difficult. The austerity measures were designed in part to control economic growth, which soared to 20.7 percent last year to 8 percent in 1990. Economists predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 percent and retail sales will be up only 15 percent, compared to a 27.8 percent jump in 1988. The Customs Administration said restrictions on imports were paying off. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recorded its first trade surplus of the year in September, with exports exceeding imports by $ 345 million on total trade of $ 9.19 billion. Inflation has almost leveled off and retail prices were up 18.5 percent in the first six months of 1989. Inflation in urban areas was well above 30 percent last year. The government has yet to solve the problem of factories being forced to turn to high-priced free markets for basic materials the state is unable to supply. Production costs were up 20.2 percent in the first eight months of the year _ an 8.9 percent increase over the same period in 1988 _ because of continued supply-demand imbalances. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and other ministries complained recently that many state-run factories, staggered by rising costs, are selling their goods on the more profitable free market rather than to the state. Smaller, locally run firms, which have provided the Chinese economy with its punch in recent years, have been hit hard by the withdrawal of credit and many are being forced out of business. The closures have added to the unemployment crisis in the countryside, where small industries have provided 100 million jobs in the past decade. People are reluctant to return to the land, which already faces a labor surplus. Tens of millions have drifted into the cities to look for construction work and menial jobs that have dried up under the austerity plan. The government continues to pour large amounts of money into large state industries, many of which are overstaffed, inefficient and uncompetitive. The bank said total debt owed by state firms to banks and other enterprises has reached $ 29.3 billion.

<TEXT>
 Stock prices tumbled today in the most spectacular drop of the year, battered by fear of higher inflation and word that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> takeover bid may have collapsed. The speed of the decline spooked traders in a startling reminder of the worst stock panic ever almost two years ago on Oct. 19. By late afternoon, the widely watched <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks had plunged 115 points to the 2,645 level, by far the biggest drop for the index this year. Other stock indices also fell sharply. If the 115-point drop held until closing, it would be the fourth biggest drop in the Dow industrials on record, in terms of points lost. The largest was the 508-point drop of Oct. 19, 1987, the second-largest was a 156.83-point drop a week after that, and the third largest was a 140.58-point drop on Jan. 8, 1988. Brokers said the drop was triggered partly by news that a labor-management group failed to secure financing for the proposed $ 6.75 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> is a component of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> index. Others said news from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that wholesale prices rose sharply in September suggested inflation was accelerating, reducing the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would act to ease interest rates.

<DATELINE>KOUBBA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 31-year-old Swiss flight attendant was released Friday after being held for six days in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, security sources said. Lebanese police said they had no information on the case. `` The abduction was not reported to us in the first place,'' a spokesman said. Reliable Lebanese security sources said the woman, <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, was released in the port city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> after her release and went to the village of <LOCATION> Koubba </LOCATION>. The part-time attendant for <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> has a house in this village in the Syrian-controlled north. The security source said gunmen kidnapped Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Koubba </LOCATION> Sunday and that she was `` interrogated in connection with her activities and stay in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' He did not elaborate and refused to identify the kidnappers. Reporters and photographers arriving in <LOCATION> Koubba </LOCATION>, 31 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, were told by unidentified armed guards ringing Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s house that she did not want to be disturbed. The guards, who wore civilian clothes, declined to identify themselves. They were believed to be either members of the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> intelligence service or militiamen of former <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> _ the only paramilitary force allowed to operate in the region. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 79, president when <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war broke out in 1975, heads the <LOCATION> Marada </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> militia, which is allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Christian and Moslem radio stations in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> was instrumental in Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s release. They did not elaborate. In <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappuis </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s freedom was gained through contacts by <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciolli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> based in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chappuis </PERSON> told reporters there never was any indication of a political motive behind <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s abduction and no demands were made. He refused to speculate on the motive. Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> was the third Swiss national to be abducted in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the last week. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Erriquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emmanual </PERSON> <PERSON> Christen </PERSON>, both Swiss, were abducted in the southern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> Oct. 6. No group has claimed responsibility or made demands for their release. Including the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, 18 foreigners are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They include eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, an Italian and an Irishman. Most of the foreign hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem underground factions. Held longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Police blamed the radical Palestinian Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction led by terrorist mastermind <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> for kidnapping Christen and Erriquez. The group denied involvement.

 Police on Friday found the body of a retired French army general who was reported missing after he failed to return home six days ago. The body of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON>, the 72-year-old former military commander of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was found about 6:30 p.m. under a bridge on the <LOCATION> Dordogne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at the village of <LOCATION> Izon </LOCATION>, said a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Gironde </LOCATION> prefecture, southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Police had been searching for <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON> since he failed to return home Saturday after leaving his wife at the railway station in <LOCATION> Libourne </LOCATION>, a town 20 miles from <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON> was last seen driving from the station in his <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, which was later spotted with two other people inside. Police, who lost the vehicle after a brief chase, later found the car _ burned _ about 9 miles away. Police speculated <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON> may have been thrown off the bridge, but no other details were available about the cause or circumstances of his death. An anonymous caller on Wednesday told the regional newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sud-Ouest </ORGANIZATION> that the Direct Action terrorist group had kidnapped <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON> and demanded the release of all the gang's members in jail. The caller offered no proof and police discounted the claim, saying the alleged kidnapping did not fit with the known facts.

<HEAD>House GOP Whip Says Ethics Committee Should Investigate Dickinson</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s financial dealings with an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> industrialist should be investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Friday. But <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who led the ethics crusade that forced Democrat <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to resign as speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said he wo n't file an ethics complaint to trigger an investigation of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> lawmaker, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Clearly, ... the ethics committee will look at the case and report back,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said when asked if he thought <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> had violated House rules by accepting a one-third interest in a $ 300,000 investment venture funded by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` I would be very surprised if they did n't issue some kind of ruling,'' he said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is the target of an ethics complaint filed by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. The complaint alleges that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> may have violated campaign finance laws, limits on outside income and a rule preventing acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in legislation. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has denied any violations. While the ethics committee can initiate an investigation on its own, the filing of a formal complaint by one member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against another forces the panel of six Democrats and six Republicans to vote on whether an investigation should be opened. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> had no comment on <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s statements. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said in an interview this week that he approached <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> in 1986 with `` what I thought was a good business opportunity.'' He said they formed the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> supplying the $ 300,000 and <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> supplying the `` contacts.'' Their agreement provided that any profits or losses would go one-third to <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and two-thirds to <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>. House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more than $ 100 from an individual who has a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> contends that rule does not cover <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, whose companies have done $ 50 million in government defense work since 1987. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he never made any money from the investment because the $ 300,000 was turned over to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Streit </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Streit </PERSON>'s assets were frozen in 1987, and <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the investment club has received about 90 percent of the $ 300,000 from a bankruptcy clerk that is serving <PERSON> Streit </PERSON>'s creditors.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> says she's doing OK two years after her rescue from an abandoned water well. `` I'm fine,'' the 3 -LCB- - year-old said in an extremely brief phone interview Thursday night <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> and her parents, Chip and <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON>, are doing nothing to mark the anniversary of her rescue Oct. 16, when dozens of volunteers helped her out of a well in her aunt's back yard. The toddler cried and softly sang a nursery rhyme while she was wedged 22 feet underground for 58 hours. Like the <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> family, <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> plans no commemorations _ no parades, no speeches. About the closest thing to a celebration will be the handing out of the <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> Community Spirit Award to recognize a city that responded to a person or group in need, Mayor <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. But the award probably wo n't be given Oct. 16, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, because he and about eight other judges are still looking at the 70-odd entries. He said the award, which was publicized in August in a `` Dear Abby'' column, will be given soon, but set no date. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> walks just fine, her father said, although her right little toe and the tip of her right big toe were amputated after the rescue. `` She has no memory of the incident whatsoever,'' he said. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> gets one or two cards a day, he said. When <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> was hospitalized after the rescue, she was received truckloads of cards and gifts of stuffed animals. Someone donated the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> a phone answering machine, and they were getting 100 to 200 calls a day. `` I really appreciated the outpouring of affection,'' said <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, who, with his wife, was 18 at the time of the accident. `` But, truthfully, it was a big hassle.'' <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> is curious, bright and talks well, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said, adding that she does n't suffer from nightmares or claustrophobia. The <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> seemed overwhelmed by the publicity at first, but the strain did not threaten to split them apart. `` If this did anything, it strengthened our marriage,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Assassination Conviction Thrown Out, Drifter Seeks Return to Normalcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drifter who won an appeal against his conviction for the murder of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> said Friday he does n't want to change his identity and prefers to return to the easygoing life he had before his arrest. The 10 months of imprisonment for his interrogation, trial and appeal had left him unchanged, said <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, a day after his July conviction was thrown out. `` I am what I am, and I think I'm going to be the same,'' said <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, an admitted alcohol and amphetamine abuser who has been in and out of jail or mental institutions for years. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 42, said he turned down offers of police protection and help to change his appearance and identity, saying he did not feel threatened by people who still believed he was Palme's killer. `` I have already started living as before. Police had plans for me to go away for a few weeks. But I must face the world at some point anyway,'' he told a crowded news conference in the office of his attorney, <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON>. `` What can I do? Can I live in some other part of the world? No, I do n't think so,'' he said. The appellate court on Thursday found the evidence against <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> insufficient. His release left police with no suspects, no new witnesses and no apparent leads to unravel the mystery of <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>'s shooting Feb. 28, 1986, while he walked with his wife on a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> street. `` The investigation of the Palme murder will continue,'' said state prosecutor <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morath </PERSON>. The small team of detectives still on the case were focusing efforts on finding the missing murder weapon, a .357 - caliber Magnum pistol, or any other forensic evidence, said a senior police <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> dominated Swedish politics for nearly two decades and was an international figure for socialist causes and nuclear disarmament. His slaying shocked this nation unaccustomed to street violence or political assassination. Palme was shot from close range while he and his wife, <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON> walked home from a movie. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who was sentenced by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to life imprisonment, has maintained his innocence. He spent his first night of freedom playing cards and drinking with a neighbor. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> has received help from the Swedish welfare state through an `` early retirement'' program, often used to support drunks or other people considered unemployable. Talkative and joking, <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> fielded questions in Swedish and English. He said he held no rancor toward Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, whose testimony was the key to the prosection's case against him. Though he said he would like to meet Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, he admitted it would be unlikely. `` But if it would happen, I would like to hug her. I share her loss and do not think she is lying.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> testified that she saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> when she looked up from her dying husband and was `` 100 percent'' certain he was the gunman. Legal experts said that unequivocal statement would prohibit her from testifying against anyone else accused of the crime. Another half-dozen witnesses who claimed to have seen <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> stalking Palme on the night of the crime also would be disqualified in any future case, they said. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> made no immediate public comment on <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s release

<TEXT>
 Twenty-two <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> managers are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pick up a few tips on capitalism in trip that would have been taboo just three years ago. Four senior construction executives said Friday the eight-week trip is part of their own version of perestroika, a bid to modernize and restructure <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s infrastructure. The four are guests of <ORGANIZATION> KPMG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based management and consulting firm. `` This training is very important,'' said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroyev </PERSON>, 42, head of <LOCATION> Mosinzhstroy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agency responsible for infrastructure construction and rehabilitation. It also serves as a general contractor in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a city of about 8 million residents. `` I'm absolutely sure that this visit is the most important part of the whole training process,'' <PERSON> Stroyev </PERSON> said Friday during a news conference here. The executives are busy touring construction sites and observing management and design practices in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and neighboring areas. The trip is paid for with money already earned by <ORGANIZATION> Perestroika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership <PERSON> Stroyev </PERSON> formed with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Worsham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a development firm building office and living space in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for foreigners. <PERSON> Stroyev </PERSON> is chairman of the partnership, which came into existence after Soviet officials passed a law in 1987 allowing Soviet agencies to form joint ventures with foreign companies. The partnership began four construction projects in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this year, and has received six year's rent in cash from their clients, he said. `` The reason why we chose this direction is actually there is really a serious shortage of office space, shortage of hotels and apartments, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for foreign communities,'' <PERSON> Stroyev </PERSON> said. `` This gives us the possibility to invest some hard currency to speed up the process of construction and then to get back very good return on the investments.'' The joint venture also is hoping to put together deals that would send <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> construction crews to work on projects in other countries, he said. The management training program began in June and July with a two-month series of lectures on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business and culture. The 22 Soviet executives visiting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> this month will be followed by 25 other Mosinzhstroy managers in November. About 150 others, lower level managers, will visit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign nations next year. The four <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> visitors _ <PERSON> Yefim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloutski </PERSON>, 50, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinitzki </PERSON>, 54, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samoilov </PERSON>, 62, and <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, 53, all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ are tunnel experts who supervise departments of about 2,500 employees each. <PERSON> Mosinzhstroy </PERSON> has about 35,000 employess.

<TEXT>
 The head of the nation's largest bank said Friday that some bankers feel betrayed by high-handed tactics they contend the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is using to push its Third World debt-reduction strategy. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the debt initiative unveiled in March by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had generated enormous tension in the banking industry, in part because banks were n't consulted before the plan was put in place `` With no warning and no obvious reason, all of a sudden the banks are being asked to shoulder serious economic burdens,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. `` For those -LRB- bankers -RRB- who are walking around feeling there is an element of betrayal and high-handed action and lack of consultation and so forth, there is tons of evidence to support that.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who spoke to reporters at the fall meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, did not say that he fully agreed with those feelings. Instead, he said he preferred a more benign interpretation of the administration's actions. `` Depending on the way you look at the coin, on the one hand you could feel betrayal and a change of signals and on the other hand you could look and see what is going on as a necessary pre-condition to get this -LRB- debt crisis -RRB- behind us,'' he said. There have been reports of shouting matches between bankers and administration officials, and a senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official warned last week that if commercial banks fail to lend more money to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> the consequences for the banks could be `` very painful.'' The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan calls on banks to forgive part of their Third World loans and to make new loans. Many bankers predict that because the plan envisions substantial write-offs of old debt, the banks will turn their backs on the Third World and refuse to provide the new loans needed to keep developing countries afloat. Treasury undersecretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, the chief architect of the administration's debt strategy, briefed the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the proposal Friday. Afterward, in a session with reporters, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said it was a `` fact of life that the debt strategy is a very difficult problem'' for the banks as well as the debtor countries. `` Since not everybody can have everything that they want, then obviously everybody will have some degree of unhappiness,'' he said. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> denied that he or others in the administration were putting pressure on the banks to go along with debt reduction. But he said that for banks willing to write off a portion of their old debt, the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan does offer various guarantees through international lending agencies that the remaining debt will be repaid. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said that negotiations with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the first country to benefit from the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, were `` on track'' for completion later this year and that talks were also going forward with other countries, including <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said he believed that the Mexican negotiations would result in enough banks coming forward with new money to make the plan work but that it would not be known for sure until Nov. 1, the deadline for banks to submit their proposals.

 <PERSON> Merab </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON>, a prominent Soviet Georgian dissident, was killed in an auto accident early Friday, the unofficial news agency <ORGANIZATION> Express-Khronika </ORGANIZATION> reported. A fellow activist said Soviet authorities had threatened <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON>'s life. <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON> was riding with two other Georgian pro-independence activists on a deserted wet road when the accident occurred and he was killed, the news agency said. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Chkheidze </PERSON>, who was driving, and <PERSON> Zurab </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavchavadze </PERSON>, were hospitalized with serious injuries, it said. No further details were available immediately. <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, considered the dean of dissidents in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON> had received death threats during the summer and last week. `` A week ago, we were warned by one <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> man that we shall be killed in the nearest future, <PERSON> Merab </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON> and I,'' <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> republic. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said he also was told last summer that all leaders of Georgian independence movement would be killed by Oct. 15. The threats came from `` the military staff and the military intelligence service,'' <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said, adding that he and other dissidents were so concerned that they hired private guards for their homes. During the summer, <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said a grenade exploded outside his home. News of <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON>'s death came after business hours and Soviet officials could not be reached for comment. Nationalist fervor has run high in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since spring, when 20 people were killed by Soviet soldiers sent in to halt the unrest. A recent report by a Georgian commission implicated Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> in the plan to send the soldiers. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said an impromptu gathering Friday night in downtown <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> was turning into a memorial for Kostava. Kostava, aged 59 or 60, was first arrested on political charges in 1956, according to a brief obituary carried by Express-Khronika. He served several terms in prison camps and internal exile for political activities, and `` even in the camps he continued his human rights work,'' the obituary said. <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON> was released in spring 1987 in a widespread amnesty for political prisoners. `` Until his last days, <PERSON> Merab </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON> remained one of the leaders of the Georgian human rights movement,'' said <PERSON> Express-Khronika </PERSON>, a former underground network now permitted to operate openly. <PERSON> Kostava </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> group and a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a religious-nationalist group prominent in the agitation for Georgian independence. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a sunny, mountainous republic in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region, became part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1920. Only a handful of pro-independence dissidents were active a year ago, but the movement has gained strength since spring. Thousands gathered in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Wednesday night to call for independence, protest the military draft and urge an election boycott.

<HEAD>Israel Seeks To Bar PLO Members And Limit Pre-Negotiations Meeting</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is trying to exclude <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations and to limit any talks with Palestinians to the mechanics of conducting elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, diplomatic sources said Friday. The sources commented as Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> pressed an effort to arrange a three-way meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Its main purpose would be to select Palestinians for talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about elections in the territories. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> talked by telephone again on Thursday with Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> and has had several conversations with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign was put on hold, at least so far as <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is concerned, for the Sabbath and the celebration of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which began Friday evening. With <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> making little apparent progress, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, insisted he had set no time limit on his effort. `` There is no date certain, there is no deadline,'' she told reporters. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials declined to provide any details of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s conversations with <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> and with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. `` I am not authorized,'' she said. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is known to have presented the foreign ministers a week ago with a five-point proposal that includes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> holding talks with Palestinians only if it is `` satisfied'' with the composition of the delegation. Still, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> is insisting that all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, whose covenant calls for the dismantling of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state, be barred. Palestinians who are sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> positions would be eligible, however. The meeting <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is promoting is designed to blend Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections with a 10-point formula by Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. This is proving to be very difficult. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, after consulting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, wants the delegation to include two Palestinians who were deported from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> during a 22-month rebellion against Israeli control. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, both members of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition, are opposed to the proposition, as well as to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s demand that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agree in advance it will surrender territory as part of an overall settlement. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> is also insisting that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s talks with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> be limited to making arrangements for the elections and not serve as a forum for negotiating Palestinian demands. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, on the other hand, would permit the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to raise whatever concerns they might have about the election plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposals provides for the elected Palestinians to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> arrangements for five years of limited self-rule to be followed by wider negotiations on an overall settlement.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied Friday that he was angered over internal second-guessing about the failed Panamanian coup. There have been reports the President told his staff to stop leaking post-mortem criticisms to reporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying that he's changed from the days when his frustrations gave him ulcers, denied any `` gag order,'' saying he only wanted to avoid any appearance he was criticizing his team. `` They all did a good job,'' he said at a news conference. But the president immediately indicated there might have been something that riled him a bit. `` Normally I might get a little more tense. I would n't blow up, I do n't think. And that's why I had ulcers 20 years ago, because I did n't, I kept it all inside. But I learned now to get out there and do your best, get the best information that you can and have confidence in good people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not coming to the aid of dissident Panamanian military officers who tried to overthrow Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Oct. 3. Privately, administration officials have said they were things that could have been handled differently, and that problems such as information flow hampered quick decision making. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has denied that was the case, but officials have said that procedures are under review. Other criticisms included statements that a key cable was garbled regarding whether the insurgents would turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that there had been insufficient attention to communication links with the coup leaders. `` There was n't a gag order ... and I did n't get angry. What I did say is, I do n't want to see any blame coming out of the Oval Office or attributed to the Oval Office in the face of criticism,'' he told a news conference. `` I have n't lost any confidence in our top people that are handling these matters,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a bleeding ulcer when he was in the oil business in his early 30s. His doctor told him, `` You try to do too much and you worry too much,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote in his autobiography, `` Looking Forward.'' `` All my life I'd worked at channelling my emotions, trying not to let anger or frustration influence my thinking. But I'd never given much thought to channelling my energies. That would change, however,'' he wrote.

 A former top aide at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> used her office to raise money for a charity and targeted her appeal to consultants who did business with the agency, documents in her files indicate. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s files show that when she sought donations for a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> event in 1984 she listed her <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> telephone number on her letters and asked that responses be phoned in to her secretary. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> attorney who discussed the issue Friday on the condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s action appeared to violate agency standards prohibiting the use of an office for private gain as well as rules against the misuse of government workers. One of <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s lawyers, however, disputed those assertions. `` There is absolutely no evidence that <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> gained anything from her service on behalf of a nationally recognized charity,'' attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said. `` And I'm certainly unaware of any regulation that makes the use of a secretary's time unlawful and the files reflect that -LRB- the secretary -RRB- spent an immaterial amount of her time on behalf of this charitable organization.'' The fund-raising letters for a New Year's Eve ball were sent to a number of developers and consultants who did HUD-related work, including former agency officials <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, whose law partners include at least two former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials. Also solicited was <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiedenfeld </PERSON>, an adviser to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign who is a partner in several <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> developments. Copies of the letters in <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s files show that while she listed her home address on the letters and used blank stationery she gave her <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> phone number and said those wishing to attend should contact <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nettles </PERSON>, her secretary. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the ball. Her files were released recently under the Freedom of Information Act. Her efforts on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> were first reported Thursday by The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who has refused to testify before a congressional inquiry, is a central figure in its investigation of allegations of influence peddling, fraud and mismanagement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the tenure of her boss, former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. He, too, has refused to testify, as has <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s predecessor as <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is the second former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official whose charity work has been questioned. Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> was sharply criticized in a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit for attending several fund-raisers _ attended by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> developers and consultants _ for a charity he helped establish. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined to prosecute <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> in connection with the charity work, which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said appeared to present a conflict of interest because many of the donors or their clients received lucrative subsidies from the housing agency.

<HEAD>Justice Gets Another Delay in Fernandez Iran-Contra Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday obtained at least another month's delay in the Iran-Contra trial of former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> while it ponders how to deal with secrecy issues in the case. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> granted the department's request for a month's time to consider whether it wanted to appeal its ruling that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> could n't intervene on secrecy issues in the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case. The delay until Nov. 13 gives <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> more time to consider how to deal with the politically touchy secrecy issues surrounding the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case. A three-judge panel of the court ruled Sept. 29 that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> could not appeal secrecy rulings made by the trial judge because such intervention would undermine the independence of Iran-Contra prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The court held that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s only recourse was to file an affidavit under the Classified Information Procedures Act blocking the release of information the trial judge ruled could be disclosed in court by <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s defense lawyers. Such an action would likely result in dismissal of the charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said such an affidavit would be filed only `` as a last resort.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had until Friday to notify the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> of whether it wanted a rehearing of the case by the full court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. In the request for an extension of the filing deadline, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the court's ruling `` was of substantial importance to the attorney general and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in addressing national security matters arising in the context of cases prosecuted by independent counsel. `` Accordingly, it is necessary for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to consider what, if any, further measures are appropriate in light of the decision,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> superiors and to a presidential commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair about his role in setting up an airstrip for the clandestine arms-supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels. He was originally set to go to trial in July in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distict </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> halted the trial by appealing rulings by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> that the locations of several <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could be disclosed by <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> as part of his defense. The 4th Circuit stayed the trial while it considered the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal. But the panel ruled that only the independent counsel could file appeals of trial court rulings under the secrecy law. With such power, the attorney general `` could control the prosecution directly by breaking off proceedings and appealing at will,'' the court said. `` The specter of such successive appeals might hamper the prosecution, making it difficult for independent counsel to coordinate and discharge his statutory obligations,'' the judges ruled.

 Stock prices tumbled and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average plummeted 197 points today in the most spectacular drop since the 1987 crash, battered by fear of inflation and word the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> buyout may have collapsed. The speed of the Friday the 13th decline, which came just four days after the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> set a record high, spooked traders in a startling reminder of the worst stock panic ever almost two years ago on Oct. 19. At the closing bell, the unofficial tally of the widely watched <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks had plunged to around 2,562.50, by far the biggest drop for the index this year and second only to the crash of 1987, in terms of points lost. Thursday's close was 2,759,84. `` It's total emotional and psychological chaos,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` People are dumping everything. ... A great deal of money is being lost.'' When the Dow dropped 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, closing at 1,738.74, it represented a loss of 22.6 percent of the index's value in one day Today's drop was about 7 percent. Other stock indices also fell sharply today. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index tumbled 11.43 to 185.55. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 16.56 at 378.45. Bond prices rose dramatically as investors sought a safe haven for their money in the credit markets. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 251.17 million shares, the heaviest total since 254.87 million were traded Jan. 27. Just Monday, the index closed at an all-time high of 2,791.41. That had been the fifth straight trading day to post a record high close. The second-largest Dow plunge on record, until today, was a 156.83-point drop on Oct. 26, 1987, which brought the average to 1,793,93. The third largest was a 140.58-point drop on Jan. 8, 1988, when the Dow industrials closed at 1,911.31. Brokers said today's drop was triggered partly by news that a labor-management group failed to secure financing for the proposed $ 6.75 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> is a component of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> index. Others pointed to troubles in the junk bond market, where a heavy supply of new issues coupled with investor skittishness has severely crimped investors' appetite for the high-risk issues. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> news, combined with recent worries about the junk bond market, `` seemed to trigger a selling panic,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She said that program selling accelerated the drop Still others said news from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that wholesale prices rose sharply in September suggested inflation was heating up again, reducing the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would act to ease interest rates. At 2 p.m. EDT, the Dow was off about 23 points. But an overwhelming tailspin pushed the key index down an additional 100 points in little more than an hour. The drop is eerily reminiscent of a 108-point Dow drop on a Friday exactly two years ago, which proved to be a harbinger of the century's second stock market disaster. When trading resumed the following Monday _ Oct. 19, 1987 _ the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> plunged a whopping 508 points. <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> said she did not expect the events of 1987 to be repeated. `` It's not going to go down too much further from these levels,'' she said shortly before the market closed. The worst drop so far this year occurred on March 17, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> lost about 48 points.

<HEAD>Center Shut By Two-Week Janitors' Strike to Reopen After Cleanup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pompidou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, closed for two weeks because of a janitors' strike, will reopen this weekend but only after it has been thoroughly cleaned, the museum director said Friday. The cultural complex, a hulking metal structure with giant blue and white pipes running along its facade, has been forced to turn away thousands of visitors as mountains of refuse and garbage piled up inside and out. The cleaning personnel, who work for four companies, went on strike Sept. 30 demanding higher wages and representation by a single body. Museum director <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Arhweiler </PERSON> said in a statement that the entire center was to be `` disinfected'' before opening its doors to the public, but she `` strongly urged'' visitors to help keep it clean. She said the strike was not `` completely settled'' and that the agreement reached late Thursday with the strikers provided for `` minimum service.'' She said the decision to disinfect the center was made after the head of hygiene of the city of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> called the sanitary conditions `` not at all satisfactory.'' The center normally draws 25,000 people daily to a wide variety of activities but was built originally to handle 5,000 visitors daily.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought `` room for flexibility'' Friday to avoid vetoing a bill that allows more Medicaid abortions, but both sides of the politically explosive issue offered little hope for compromise. `` I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I'm not going to change my position any. But let's see how those negotiations come out.'' White House officials met with Capitol Hill Republicans in an attempt to find a way out for the president, a top <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional aide said. But with abortion-rights forces claiming the political momentum was on their side, anti-abortion leaders turned up the heat on the president by demanding a veto of the measure permitting federally financed abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. `` The movement will expect a presidential veto, and if he does n't veto it, they're going to have a real mess on their hands,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a former domestic policy adviser in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. `` This is a time of testing for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said. `` People will be watching quite carefully to see if the White House lessens its commitment on the abortion issue, and if there is any sign it is shifting, there will be an incredible political firestorm for the Republicans.'' Neither side in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> publicly offered a compromise. Democrats acknowledged they did n't have the votes to override a veto. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not wavered in his opposition to a provision passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that would drop a decade-long ban on federally funded abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest. But he stopped short of repeating his veto threat, saying there was `` negotiation and discussion'' under way that could lead to a compromise that would avert a veto. Abortion-rights forces contend that public opinion polls show increasing numbers of voters support broader abortion rights, and that a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto would be politically costly for the president and lawmakers who voted with him. Asked if he was leaving open the possibility he would not veto the measure, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Well, because I'm told ... that the conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part. `` We'll see what we can do in terms of the conference committee to see if there is room for flexibility,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., a leader of the abortion-rights forces, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks `` unintelligible politically'' and said his side is unwilling to compromise `` There are no negotiations going on with those of us who asserted the right to choose and won last week. There is no compromise on the table,'' <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The legislation is part of a broader fiscal 1990 spending bill for the departments of labor and health and human services. The measure was sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for agreement on a separate provision, but the House language on abortion was identical to that already approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It would expand current law that permits Medicaid abortions only in cases where the life of the mother is endangered. The new provision would still prevent Medicaid funding of abortions in most cases, but would allow it in cases of rape and incest if the victim `` promptly'' reported it. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to possible change in `` conference language,'' the bill has already been reported by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees and goes back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which could send it directly to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Most House members had already returned to their districts, as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> held only a pro-forma session Friday. An aide to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership, declining to be identified, said there were no talks under way involving <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who a day earlier pleaded with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to veto the measure. On the other side of the issue, spokesmen for Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, co-chairman of the House Pro-life Caucus, and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., long the sponsor of the abortion restriction legislation, said they had no compromise in mind <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the leading anti-abortion group, said he did n't believe `` there's any way to avoid a veto of this bill. House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> suggested Thursday that specifying a time limit for reporting by the victim might be a compromise, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that was unacceptable. Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was searching for a way to weaken his opposition in light of a changing political climate since last summer's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that made increased state regulation of abortion possible `` Since the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has backed out of intervening in most abortion cases before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` I believe he will back out of this veto.''

<HEAD>Japanese Socialists Deny Pachinko Payoffs</HEAD>
<UNK>By TETSUO JIMBO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said on Friday that no such thing as a pachinko scandal existed. Socialist legislators stand accused of accepting bribes from pinball parlor owners to lighten up on regulations restricting the light-up industry. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> raised the allegation in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday following reports in the Shukan Bunshun magazine suggesting that money from Japanese-style pinball, called pachinko, had infiltrated politics. `` I would like to express regret for causing concern among the people in the so-called pachinko scandal,'' <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. `` But we would like to clarify that no such thing as the pachinko scandal exists and it is no more than an illusion created by <PERSON> Shukan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunshun </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> acknowledged nine party lawmakers received $ 55,000 in donations from the pachinko association, but said the donations were legal and no member tilted toward the industry. `` Our investigation found no trace of wrongdoing,'' he added. Receiving donations from industry is common and legal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as long as recipients do no favors in return. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it investigated claims that several of its legislators used their influence to water down bills regulating the pachinko business in exchange for donations ranging from $ 1,400 to $ 3,500. <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> also said the party is still investigating news reports that a Socialist legislator received donations from a pro-North <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> organization called the Association of Korean Residents in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Receiving donations from foreigners and foreign organizations violates the Political Fund Control Law. Most of the 700,000 Koreans in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are not Japanese citizens, and are divided into associations that favor communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> or capitalist, pro-West <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Koreans are major operators in pachinko, a widely played form of pinball in which winners receive prizes. About 15,000 pachinko parlors are strung across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with annual sales estimated at $ 21 billion, according to industry sources. <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pachinko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parlor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> bought $ 31,000 worth of tickets for a fund-raising party of <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, a pachng of Declines

 Hard-liner <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Friday rejected talks with the East German opposition, but officials of his regime announced they had freed pro-democracy activists from jail and would let hundreds more refugees go West. For the first time, a high-ranking East German official spoke openly when asked about a possible resignation by the 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>.

She spoke to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that buses were arranged for the refugees, but no firm plans were announced for their departure. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> announced that all but 11 of the estimated 1,000 protesters jailed after pro-democracy demonstrations last week and on Monday were released. It said 11 people charged with violent acts during the demonstrations remained in jail and would face trial. <PERSON> Dietmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, the second-ranking official in the East German Culture Ministry, told reporters in <LOCATION> Wolfenbuettel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>: `` As for <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s resignation, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> must make that decision all alone.'' He said any decision would require a meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and `` I do n't know if a meeting is planned or already called.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> himself, recuperating from recent gallbladder surgery, said Friday after meeting with leaders of political parties allied with the Communists: `` We do n't need suggestions for the improvement of socialism that are really intended to cause its demise,'' It was his toughest statement yet on opposition movements, which have grown in strength at time of unrest at home and flight to the West by tens of thousands of young skilled workers. A Communist Party position paper called opposition groups `` enemies of the socialist order.'' East German opposition leader <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is only open to reforms as long as its own power is assured.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s political future remained the subject of speculation. Some reports have said he is about to be removed from office. Die Welt, a newspaper based in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, quoted West German Interior Minister <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was `` in a pre-revolutionary state.'' As of Friday, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s picture had not appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> for three days, but state TV did show footage of him greeting the political delegation Friday. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiffert </PERSON>, a former adviser to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> who defected to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` the majority of the Politburo blames <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> for the current crisis.'' In his remarks Friday, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> urged East Germans to work together for `` continuity and renewal, through deep-seated change and reform,'' an apparent response to the public demand. He made clear, however, that `` the leading role of the party'' would remain intact. Echoing an earlier Politburo statement about the flight to the West, he said: `` It must concern us all when our citizens, for whatever reasons, turn their backs on their country. Open dialogue is necessary to make Socialism more and more attractive.'' Growing discontent has forced the leadership to adopt a more conciliatory line. Ranking officials have indicated there could be changes in the rigidly controlled media, but sharp attacks continue to be aimed at opposition groups. The party position paper said `` open and hidden enemies of the socialist order'' could create a mass movement at odds with the government.

<TEXT>
 A former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official won approval of a multimillion-dollar project _ a month before the application was filed _ after appealing directly to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee was told Friday. Former General Services Administrator <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said that since its approval in early 1987, the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, project has returned $ 800,000 in profits to him through up-front tax credits without risking any of his own money. `` I'm a little surprised at the way it went and I find myself a little uncomfortable at the position I'm in now,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> told the employment and housing panel of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Frankly, it embarasses me.'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said he saw the 316-unit <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Moderate Rehabilitation Program project as an opportunity to both `` make money and do some good'' by providing rent-subsidized housing for poor people. The onetime <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, businessman, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> got to know <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> during the transition between the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administrations in late 1980 and early 1981. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> was a member of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s transition team for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> subsequently was named to head the agency. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> was appointed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for building or leasing most government offices and acting as a supply officer for much of the federal bureaucracy. He held the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> post until 1984, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named him <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agencies in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. About six months after resigning in 1986, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said he learned of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> project. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> housing officials were unaware of the potential for a rehabilitation grant until after he tried to persuade them to submit an application. `` I made it plain at that discussion there were no guarantees at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s office for about 15 minutes in late January 1987, telling him that the city of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> would be submitting an application and that he hoped it would get proper consideration. `` I recall that I did not ask him for a decision and he did not give me one,'' he said, adding that he talked with no one else in <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s office about the project. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said he did n't know of the project's approval by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> until late April, when the <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> was notified. The subcommittee, however, revealed a March 4 memo from then-Federal Housing Administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> to <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant, on funding decisions that included a handwritten message adding the 316 <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> units. `` This is the first time I've seen this,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> told the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> declined to agree with an assertion by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that his meeting with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was the sole factor behind the favorable action on <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> `` I do n't want to concede that, although I do concede that's the way it looks,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said. `` That's what thousands of people do in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ... making sure that things do n't slip between the cracks.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> then unveiled a memo from Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> dated April 7 _ two weeks before the city submitted a formal application _ stating `` ... and <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> are set.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said the combination of the memos and <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>'s testimony contradicts an assertion by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> before the subcommittee last spring that he took no part in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding decisions. The subcommittee has subpoenaed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to testify before the panel again later this month and in November. In his last appearance in September, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> took his Fifth Amendment rights on self-incrimination and refused to answer questions. <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> was developed as a limited partnership between <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Muss </PERSON>, a law partner of <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>'s daughter. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Muss </ORGANIZATION> used <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guaranteed mortgages to borrow $ 8.2 million _ $ 4 million for buying a run-down apartment complex and $ 4 million to upgrade it _ and sharing in $ 2.4 million in up-front tax credits plus $ 1.8 million in annual <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rent subsidies. The project surfaced in an audit by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general in April as an example of underwriters escalating the value of projects in co-insuring their mortgages with <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>.

 Riding a parade float has its price _ even if you're Miss <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In this town it'll cost at least $ 20.

 Four-time International Whistle-Off Grand Champion <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> thinks he blew it this year. The Canadian whistling wonder and the only person to win the contest more than once was coaxed into being on the judge's committee for this weekend's 12th annual event `` They'd just as soon I did n't compete,'' <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON>, 58, said of contest organizers. `` I agreed to it, but I kind of wish I was competing. `` I guess they want to make way for some other people to win. But I'll be back. I'll take a couple of years off and come back in 1991.'' <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON>, who began blowing melodic tunes along with his mother and with radio shows when he was six years old, is among hundreds of dedicated whistlers who ca n't imagine not putting lips together to make music. `` I practiced for 40 years, from the time I was six until I was 46, before I entered my first contest,'' said <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. `` With all that work behind me, I'm not going to quit now.'' The railroad brakeman, who whistles contemporary and classical tunes, is among 60 competitors, performers and judges scheduled to attend this weekend's whistle-off. `` It's great for the voice and lungs,'' said organizer <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>. `` And besides, you ca n't be unhappy if you're whistling.'' Ms. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said whistling is enjoying a resurgence after its heyday in the 1940s when the networks had staff whistlers and entertainers such as <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> often puckered up before the microphone. Sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whistlers </ORGANIZATION>, this year's contest has six categories and also will name a Grand Champion whistler by adding up the best scores in events entered.

<HEAD>Bolar's Nitrofurantoin Targeted by FDA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it plans to withdraw <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s approval to sell a generic drug used to treat urinary tract infections and it wants the company to withdraw the product from drugstores. In a letter to the company, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said tests on samples of <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s drug and the brand-name drug `` strongly suggest that <PERSON> Norwich-Eaton </PERSON>'s Macrodantin product was substituted for <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s product'' in tests required for <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is also moving to change its listing of <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s version of Macrodantin, generically called nitrofurantoin, to indicate to physicians that the agency does not consider the product to be therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name drug. At the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s request, <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> last weekend agreed to recall its nitrofurantoin from wholesalers. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said in the letter it wants the company to withdraw the product from pharmacy shelves as well. Officials of the <LOCATION> Copiague </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company had left for the day and could not be reached for comment. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is investigating other product-switching allegations against <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>, including one involving the company's version of the high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide. A federal criminal investigation is also under way into the matter. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> does not have the authority to remove a drug from the market. If a company does not comply with a recall request, the agency can only force a recall in court.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruling that authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to arrest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fugitives overseas without the permission of foreign countries drew quick signals of displeasure Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a very narrow legal opinion based on consideration only of domestic <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> law,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` It did not take into account international law, nor did it weigh the president's constitutional responsibility to carry out the foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' In a brief exchange with reporters <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added: `` This procedure will not be used absent a full interagency discussion of all the foreign policy'' implications. The White House issued a statement echoing <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks and saying, `` There will be no arrests abroad that have not been considered through that interagency process.'' Earlier, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the legal opinion by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION> did not necessarily mean President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would authorize such arrests to take place. `` It is important to isolate the above question of whether domestic legal authority might exist from the question of whether the president will, in fact, authorize the use of that authority,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` In any given case, the president must weigh his responsibility for managing both foreign affairs and law enforcement,'' said <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, who noted that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> only `` learned of it this morning'' in news accounts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, too, had not been informed of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling, said an administration source, who spoke on condition of anonymity The president was caught off guard when asked about the ruling following its disclosure in Friday editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. `` I'm embarrassed to say I do n't know what it is. I'll have to get back to you with your question,'' the president told reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said that `` people at the White House and other parts of the government have been informed through the process in drawing up this opinion.'' Asked why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not know about the opinion, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said: `` Their lawyers did.'' `` Our job is to provide legal advice and that's what we've done,'' he said The opinion changing a 9-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s arrest powers overseas was issued June 21 by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it had taken no action under the ruling, nor would any such arrests be made without an interagency review. The bureau said it requested the opinion to clarify its authority to arrest a number of fugitives at large overseas who are being sought on such charges as hijacking, hostage taking and other terrorist acts. `` This advice, along with many other factors, will be considered in the devlopment of any plan to apprehend fugitives abroad,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Asked if the opinion sanctioned kidnapping, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: `` We do n't see it that way.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional rights subcommittee, said he would hold hearings on the policy, which he said `` would make us an international brigand, an international outlaw. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>'s comments signaled that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would seek to influence any presidential decision to allow the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to circumvent a foreign country's extradition procedures to make such an arrest. One of the diplomatic concerns is that the arrest of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fugitive in foreign territory without the country's permission could provoke a reciprocal action. The ruling could conceivably be used by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to arrest Panamaniam strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to trial in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s finding reversed a policy dating back to the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration that specifically prohibited the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from circumventing extradition procedures in a foreign country. The 1980 policy was issued in response to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> proposal to kidnap fugitive financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>, who is still at large, is accused of milking hundreds of millions of dollars from mutual funds before fleeing the country in 1973. Federal laws enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and 1986 gave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities jurisdiction to prosecute acts of terrorism involving American citizens overseas, including airplane hijackings and killings carried out to coerce a government. But those laws did not confer on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies the power to make arrests in other countries without the permission of foreign governments. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> went to great lengths in 1987 to lure convicted hijacker <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> to a yacht in international waters off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to arrest him for leading a 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner carrying several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a Lebanese, was recently sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the hijacking, which began in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.N. Solution Proposed for Breaking Cambodia Deadlock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs on Friday proposed a major role for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to halt bloodshed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and break the deadlock over proposals for a political settlement. The current reluctance of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and other countries to compromise on an overall solution for the Southeast Asian country points to `` a period over the next several months in which each side tests itself on the battlefield,'' said the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-NY </LOCATION>. He also opposed normalizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> so long as <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> remains uncompromising about <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> _ but said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` should be prepared to normalize, and begin a new chapter, if and when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is prepared to cooperate in the search for settlement of the Cambodian problem.'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> presented his Cambodian settlement formula in an appearance before the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It would be based on `` a U.N.-supervised interim administration perhaps along the lines of the U.N.-supervised administration in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' the South-West African territory now in transition from South African rule to independence. The threat of revived civil war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> resulted from failure of an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last August to agree on an overall political solution. Withdrawal a month later of Vietnamese forces that occupied <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for 11 years has triggered moves for a return to power by the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, blamed for more than a million Cambodian deaths during their 1975-78 rule. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> termed a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return `` politically and morally unacceptable'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A Cambodian solution under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag `` would respond to the various concerns'' that deadlocked the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. `` It could be more politically acceptable than any formula on the table so far.

<HEAD>Suspect Says He Killed SAfrican Runner's Father After Sexual Assault</HEAD>

 A 26-year-old man arrested in the slaying of the father of Olympic runner <PERSON> Zola </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> told a magistrate he did so after <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> tried to sexually assault him. He was denied bail Friday. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, arrested hours after <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'s body was found Sept. 22, acknowledged the shooting to Magistrate <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladman </PERSON> during cross-examination Thursday when he sought bail, the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and other local news media said. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, however, has yet to enter a formal plea. <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> said he was to be tried for murder. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, who has admitted to 11 previous convictions on various charges, said he had moved into <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'s farm near <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION> two days before the shooting to do construction work. Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, 23, had been estranged from her 59-year-old father for several years and did not attend his funeral in accordance with a directive in his will. She said after his death that her father was a homosexual and that this was a factor in her parents' separation in 1984 and subsequent divorce. Because of her father's British ancestry, Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> was able to obtain a British passport and compete in 1984 Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. South Africans are barred from the Olympics and most international competition because of the government's racial segregation policies. In the 3,000-meter run in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> collided with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> star <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, and the American was unable to continue. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> finished seventh to a chorus of boos. She later set several world distance records while living and training in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in May 1988, complaining of mental exhaustion because of harassment from anti-apartheid activists. She says she will race in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but make no attempt to return to international competition.

 A 27-year-old man was arrested Friday on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering a girl in central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, police said. Police officials identified the man as <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Urayama </PERSON>, a former owner of a coffee shop. Police said 8-year-old <PERSON> Misako </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> was kidnapped Wednesday near the town of <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION>. She was found dead Friday on a hill near a road where <PERSON> Urayama </PERSON> was arrested Thursday on charges of violating a traffic law, police said. <PERSON> Misako </PERSON>, the daughter of <LOCATION> Sei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobayashi </LOCATION>, 41, a carpenter, disappeared Wednesday afternoon while heading home from a nearby shop. Two hours later, a man telephoned and demanded $ 69,500 in ransom, police officials said. In more than a dozen phone calls, the man agreed that $ 34,750 would be enough and designated places to receive the ransom from the father, the officials said. However, the man did not appear. Police detained Urayama Thursday after chasing his car, which ran a red light, the officials said. According to police figures, there have been 166 kidnap cases involving ransom since the end of World War II, and the girl was the 31st known victim to be killed in such a case. Most recently, <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, a 26-year-old print shop worker, was arrested in August on charges of kidnapping and killing four girls, ages 4 to 7, over the past year in a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> suburb.

<HEAD>US-Sponsored Program to Test Driving Under Influence of Marijuana</HEAD>

 A Dutch university is recruiting volunteers for a program commissioned by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to test the skills of drivers under the influence of marijuana, a researcher said Friday. The two-year <ORGANIZATION> Limburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> project will be conducted on a closed-off section of highway and will be the first to involve the actual use of automobiles by drivers who have smoked the drug, researcher <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON> said. He said the purpose of the research, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, is to determine as realistically as possible how marijuana affects a driver's skill and behavior. Marijuana is not believed to be addictive but has been blamed for loss of concentration, lower reaction speed and even brain damage and hallucinations in some users. Its effects on drivers have been investigated only under laboratory conditions, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON> said most of those tests had shown a negative effect on performance. Motorists who smoke marijuana often drink alcohol as well, making it difficult to pinpoint the specific cause of an accident, he said. No figures on drug-related auto accidents were available from the Dutch government. Volunteers in the program, to be supervised by health authorities and the prosecutor's office, will be closely screened and known drug dealers will be barred, the university said. `` We'll need to be sure subjects use marijuana regularly, at least once a month,'' an announcement said. `` A certain amount of driving experience will also be required.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gier </PERSON> denied the choice of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> as a site was related to the country's liberal attitudes toward drug use. Possession of up to 50 grams -LRB- 1.75 ounces -RRB- of hashish or marijuana is a minor offense in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, punishable by a seldom-imposed maximum fine of 50 guilders -LRB- $ 18 -RRB-. Both drigs are available in hundreds of coffee houses in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> alone. Dutch law forbids driving under the influence of any substance that could impair a driver's skills, but specifically mentions only alcohol. According to <ORGANIZATION> Limburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> figures, 10 to 15 percent of all citizens under age 18 have smoked marijuana at least once and 5 percent are regular users. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up to one-fourth of high school and college students smoke marijuana regularly, the university announcement said. Marijuana is derived from the cannabis plant. Hashish, which contains the same active chemicals in a more concentrated form, is made from cannabis resin.

 Rebels made their third major attack on a civilian target this week, killing 24 people, the national news agency AIM reported Friday. Troops of the leftist government killed three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> during the guerrilla raid Wednesday on the southern village of <LOCATION> Macaretane </LOCATION>, AIM said. Seven civilians were also wounded during the raid, AIM said, citing a report on state radio.

Rebels also killed 13 people in an attack Monday on the village of <LOCATION> Nwachikolwane </LOCATION>, about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, AIM said. The rebels, who have been accused of widespread atrocities, have been fighting since 1977.

<HEAD>Defecting Syrian Pilot Says He Flew to Freedom</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Syrian pilot who defected to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said Friday he was willing to chance flying his Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border missile batteries for a chance at freedom. Maj. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> told a news conference arranged by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army that he sometimes flew at just under 100 feet as he crossed into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at high speed over the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> last Wednesday. `` It was a difficult mission. I did n't know where I was going to land. I did n't know if I would find a facility to land. I was going into the unknown,'' the 34-year-old flyer said. `` The section I was crossing was spread all over with missiles.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said he flew at 700 to 750 mph and `` below 50 meters, sometimes 30 meters, sometimes 40.'' A meter equals 3.3 feet. The dark-haired pilot chain-smoked during the news conference at a military base near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. He wore an olive-green Syrian flight suit. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> spoke in Arabic, with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officers translating his words into English. No tape recorders or cameras were allowed. Much criticism has been expressed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over <PERSON> Adel </PERSON>'s ability to fly into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without being intercepted. Asked about this, <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said his own warning system indicated he was `` observed,'' though he said earlier he switched off his electronic gear to fly in silence. He said the thought of being intercepted `` entered my mind'' but added: `` I feel that a country which has confidence can not be afraid of one single airplane and would take time to evaluate the meaning of what's going on before taking action.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has claimed <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> did not defect but landed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because his plane had technical problems. It asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to help return the pilot and aircraft. But <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said he did not want to return home. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> wants to meet me and take me back to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, I would refuse this,'' he said. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> refused to answer most questions on politics but said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s pilots considered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force better than their own. `` No one in the Syrian air force feels that they could defeat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, that they are superior to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. The pilot said he had no contacts with Israelis before he landed at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION>, 57 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` Nobody was expecting me,'' he said. He said he decided to flee <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> because of `` my own personal feelings.'' `` I wanted to live in a democracy where people can express their views with freedom,'' he said. `` I am going to open a new chapter by coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Asked for his views on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s politics, he repeated his desire for freedom and added that `` by implication, you can presume my thoughts about the political system in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> also was asked if he wanted to stay in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I said I wanted to live in a democracy ... so you might conclude I want to live here,'' he replied. But he added he was uncertain what his plans were. The pilot said his treatment by Israelis has been `` gentle.'' He said he was questioned mainly about his reason for defecting and not yet about <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s air force. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> said little about his MiG-23 and refused to compare it with other Syrian aircraft. He refused to answer questions about his family, saying only he was born in <LOCATION> Aleppo </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and graduated from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s air academy. It has been reported he is a bachelor and a Sunni Moslem.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Killed, At Least Four Wounded In Clashes With Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers shot and killed two young Palestinians in separate incidents Friday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army reported. A third Palestinian was seriously wounded by gunfire when he drove his car into an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> man and a soldier in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army said. At least three other Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops in the occupied lands, according to army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. The confrontations came as Jews in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> began the week-long celebration of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the Israelites' wandering in the desert after their biblical exodus from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. It is celebrated by building huts to symbolize life in the wilderness. The deaths brought to 593 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops or civilians during the 22-month-old uprising in the occupied lands. Another 128 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis also have died in the violence. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kalkiya </LOCATION>, 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, border police fatally shot <PERSON> Azni </PERSON> <PERSON> Ediab </PERSON>, 18, after he tried to attack them with an ax, the army said. It said police arrested another youth and placed the town under curfew. The second fatal shooting occurred at <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jala </LOCATION>, six miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, when soldiers encountered masked youths trying to incite residents to violence, the army said. `` The soldiers ordered them to stop and fired into the air when they tried to escape,'' said an army spokesman, who can not be identified under military rules. `` The troops then shot at their legs and one youth was killed.'' In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, an Israeli civilian suffered serious injuries and a soldier minor injuries when a Palestinian ran them down in his car, the army spokesman said. Both were taken to hospitals in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. The spokesman said an army officer and a soldier who witnessed the incident in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> fired on the car and wounded the driver, identified by hospital officials as <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adi </PERSON>, 23, of the Shati refugee camp. The army would not release the names of the Israeli civilian and soldier and gave no explanation of why it believed the act was intentional. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the army sealed the houses of two youths detained in July and accused of being members of an underground `` popular committee'' that kidnapped and tortured Gazans to enforce directives in the Palestinian uprising, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said. A 3-year-old boy from Shati, <PERSON> Attiyah </PERSON> el-Ghurani, remained in critical condition at the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after suffering a shattered skull Thursday, the army said. Officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said Thursday the injury was caused by a rubber bullet fired by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. An army spokeswoman said initial investigations indicated troops did not fire in the area.

 Mayor <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> said Friday he will abide by a judge's order to stop praying at high school football games at a city-owned stadium, but he promised to fight the prohibition in court. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubina </PERSON> on Thursday imposed a 10-day restraining order against <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> and other city officials until a hearing in a lawsuit filed by a civil liberties group. On Aug. 24, <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> defied an 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling that public prayers before high school football games are unconstitutional. <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman W.F. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> stood on the 50-yard line at the city's <LOCATION> Cramton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION> and prayed aloud prior to the prep season's first game as protesters blared air horns and waved signs against the prayer. The mayor, however, said he will not violate <PERSON> Dubina </PERSON>'s order, which came on a lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the city and the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> also is covered by the order. But <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> said he believes the federal appeals court ruling in January, which affected <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, does not apply when events are held on city property. `` This temporary restraining order does apply to me and as a constitutional officer I will not pray until I can get a new court order in place,'' <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> said. He said private funds, not city or education funds, would be used to battle the lawsuit. In May, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand the appeals court decision. The high court restricted pregame prayers where the promotion of religion at a school-sanctioned event violates the constitutional separation of church and state. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the August invocation by <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> clearly violated the appeals court ruling. <PERSON> Dubina </PERSON> will schedule a hearing on the civil liberties group's request for a permanent order against such prayers within 10 days

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> will discuss crime fighting tactics with Soviet officials and the American legal system with law students during a six-day trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In what is being billed as the first official visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and a group of aides leave Saturday for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The attorney general said his discussions with Soviet legal authorities would include `` joint law enforcmeent concerns in the fields of drugs and organized crime.'' `` It is my hope that through this visit we can establish a continuing dialogue between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet legal officials on matters of common concern and interest,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement issued on the eve of his departure. `` We have been asked to discuss with Soviet officials such issues as human rights, the role of the judiciary and commercial and regulatory law, including environmental law,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. The attorney general also plans to meet at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with Soviet dissidents and human rights activists, said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. Soviet emigration is also expected to be a topic of discussion between <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Soviet officials. The department has expressed a desire to move the processing of Soviet refugees by Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Such discussions would be held against the backdrop of increased emigration and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision to reduce the number of Soviet refugees entering this country. On Oct. 18, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> plans to address law students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> about the American legal system, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` He is going to talk about our basic legal system and the values that underpin it.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said it was still uncertain whether <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would meet with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school. The attorney general will meet with members of the Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled this fall to consider criminal-law reform legislation, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` There is a great desire on the part of Soviet officials to learn about how we deal with certain problems and issues,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Besides legal reform, the Soviets are interested in discussing ways of enforcing environmental regulations.

 Until Wednesday, the 1 -LCB- - year-long effort to move minority families into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s tough, predominantly white housing projects seemed to be on the right track Just last week, city officials reached a housing settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. But when nine shots were fired at a black family's apartment in one of the projects, the optimism surrounding federally mandated housing desegration in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> evaporated. Police cars converged on the Old Colony housing project, and officers guarded the apartment of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, 39, and her family. For many residents, the incident brought back memories of the violence that resulted from court-ordered busing in the 1970s. For city officials, it was an alarming setback. In a news conference outside the <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> apartment Friday, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said everything was being done to find those responsible for `` this senseless shooting.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a lifelong <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> resident, said those responsible `` will pay a heavy price.'' No one was hurt in the incident Wednesday evening at the third-floor apartment shared by <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, her husband, four children and grandson. Two bullets pierced the steel door to the apartment. One narrowly missed her 11-year-old stepson, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Honeycutt </PERSON>. An hour before the shooting, daughter <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, 17, told police, she bumped into a white girl at a nearby convenience store. The white girl made a racial comment and threatened to return with others, the teen-ager said. Five or six teen-agers carrying baseball bats showed up within a few minutes, and <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> and a friend fled, she said. She said two other teen-agers on a motorcycle tried to run them down as they ran to her family's apartment and that someone threw a brick at the home after they were inside. Police Detective <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said Friday that authorities were close to making an arrest. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> said Thursday the family would move out of the project, but <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said Friday that they had decided to stay. The family would not speak to reporters Friday, and asked the police to keep the press away. The Bullocks are one of only 11 black families among 821 families at <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colony </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. There are 29 black families among 954 families at the neighboring <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> project. The shooting came a week after the city settled out of court with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> over discrimination in minority housing. The agreement will provide about $ 3 million in damages to around 1,500 minority families who were denied housing or steered away from the city's mostly white housing projects. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> told reporters that most <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> residents were outraged by the shooting and should not be stereotyped as bigots, but some Old Colony residents were not as reassuring. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON>, an 11-year-old white who lives in the project, called <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Honeycutt </PERSON> `` one of my best friends.'' But he said some of his neighbors feel differently about blacks. `` A lot of people hate them,'' <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> said Friday. `` I do n't. I like them.'' A 16-year-old boy who only gave his name as <PERSON> Matty </PERSON> and said he'd lived in a project apartment for a year complained that some of the black families in the project `` can be really loud and make a lot of noise. `` If white people moved into <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, we'd be dead within a year,'' he said, referring to the predominantly black neighborhood. Another project resident, 42-year-old <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, was more sympathetic. `` I was surprised,'' she said. `` It was a shooting that should n't have happened.''

Packer guilty. ``ALferd'' CQ.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gold prospector <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was guilty of murder and ate his victims, too, an expert concluded in a Friday the 13th report on the most celebrated instance of cannibalism in American history. `` <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was as guilty as sin and his sins were all mortal ones,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, a professor of law and forensic science who led a summer expedition of archeology, anthropology, pathology and firearms experts to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Colo,. to uproot the scarred remains of <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s five fellow prospectors. They studied the bones for 30 days. His purpose, <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said at a news conference, was to show how much can be learned through forensic science, a field he says is underutilized in criminal investigations. But he also did it, he said, because `` I am an iconoclast and this was a great icon to clast.'' Over the years, <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> became an icon of folk history. At an annual feast of bad taste at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, he is toasted. His bust has been displayed in the state capitol. In 1901, a lively newspaper campaign led authorities to parole him 15 years after he was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Spreading the <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> legend has been a remark attributed to Judge <PERSON> Melville </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> upon sentencing Packer: `` They was sivin Dimmicrats in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and ye eat five of them, God damn ye!'' <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said his scientific sleuthing established that <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> never said it, that the quotation was made up by a bartender. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran, was convicted of murder in 1883 and of five charges of manslaughter three years later when the first conviction was overturned on a technicality. He was accused of killing his fellow prospectors in 1874 and then staying alive by eating their flesh while stranded in the snow during a murderous winter in the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. His story was that one of the gold seekers, hunger-crazed <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, came at him with a hatchet when he returned empty handed from a five-day sortie in search of wildlife. He said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had killed and cannibalized the others. He said he shot <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> in self-defense, finished him off with the hatchet and then survived the winter on his companions' flesh. But the bones showed contradictory evidence, <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said. `` It is plain as a pikestaff that <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was the one who was on the attack, not Bell,'' <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said. Wounds on the bones of three of the victims `` were caused by a hatchet-like instrument at a time when these persons were defending themselves from the attack of an aggressor,'' he said. He said the marks suggested the victims had raised their arms to fend off blows. <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said the evidence that <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s story is false, and thus that <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> is guilty, is that the angle of the blade marks on the bones from which the flesh had been taken _ including the bones believed to be <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s _ indicated that the cuts were all made by the same person. However, <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> acknowledged that his findings had their limits. He said, for example, he could not be sure which set of bones was Bell's. Anthropologist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, who scrutinized the bones for 26 days, said he could n't share <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>' conclusions `` It could possibly be the right scenario, but scientifically we can not substantiate it,'' <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said. Last summer, <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> went further, saying his study of the remains actually supported <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s story. <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, however, entertained no doubts. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, he said, `` was having his flesh filets morning, noon and night'' even though he could have lived by killing rabbits. He said the fresh evidence `` convicts him beyond any shadow of a doubt.'' <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was a fiend, `` base ... brutish ... barbaric.'' The experts also tried to settle forever the fiendish question of how <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> spelled his first name. `` A-l-f-e-r-d,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, a criminal investigator from <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. His evidence was elementary: on court records, military records and parole papers, the name appears conventionally, `` <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>,'' but whenever <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> signed a document he used the spelling, `` Alferd.

<TEXT>
 A strong earthquake rocked the volcanic island of <LOCATION> Oshima </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> early Saturday and caused buildings to sway in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but no immediate sign of eruptions or reports of damage or casualties followed. The quake struck at 6:20 a.m. It had a preliminary reading of 5.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale on <LOCATION> Oshima </LOCATION>, nearly 75 miles south of the Japanese capital, and in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorologists </ORGANIZATION> said the quake was centered 25 miles below the ocean surface near <LOCATION> Oshima </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said police received no reports of damage or injury. Mt. <PERSON> Mihara </PERSON>, an active volcano on <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON>, erupted in November 1986, spewing molten rock high into the air and forcing more than 11,000 people to evacuate. No direct casualties resulted, though one person died later of a heart attack. A milder eruption occurred a year later. <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> is part of an island chain considered to be one of the most volcanically active in the world. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale ia a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage and one of magnitude 6, severe damage.

 A man once charged with strangling his wife lost temporary custody of his two young daughters Friday when a judge ruled him an unfit father. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> refuses to deal with a drug and alcohol problem and cited the `` lingering thoughts'' that would remain in his daughters' minds over whether <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> really killed their mother. <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> left a courtroom in tears, denying he killed his wife and vowing to appeal the custody decision. `` Somebody took my wife and now they took my daughters away. I will appeal, and I will get my daughters back,'' he said. `` Why should I live the rest of my life without my daughters?'' <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, 33, spent 17 months in jail on a first-degree murder charge in the January 1987 strangulation of his wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>. Her body was found on a remote beach after a night out with her husband. The murder charge was dismissed in June 1988 by a judge who ruled police detectives had coerced a taped confession from <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> and the confession could not be used as evidence against him. No one else has been arrested in the case. <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> claims he last saw his wife alive the night of Jan. 27, 1987, when the two left their daughters with a baby sitter and went to a nightclub. He said she disappeared when he went to get her coat. Temporary custody of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Juline </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, 7, was awarded to their mother's sister, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. She was appointed their guardian shortly after the 1987 strangulation. The question of permanent custody of the children is to be decided later. `` It is the opinion of this court that <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>'s drug and alcohol abuse, his inability to be truthful, his denial of any problems in the parenting area and in the drug abuse area and thus his lack of addressing these problems through counseling are clear and convincing proof that he is an unfit parent at this time,'' said Circuit Judge <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` The stigma of a confession and the lingering thoughts that <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> might have killed <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> would be ever-present in the girls' mind and thus prohibit them from ever trusting him or even getting close to him,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> began a legal battle for his daughters after his release from jail. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> prohibited unsupervised visits between <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> and the girls in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> but allowed supervised visits in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON> and the judge said the older girl expressed mixed feelings of wanting to return to her father but not wanting to leave her aunt. `` She was very much pulled and torn, kind of like I was,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said.

 The slayings of two Colombian newpaper officials demonstrate a shift in the challenge to press freedom in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said participants in the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Just as government-imposed restrictions on press freedoms are easing in countries like <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, international drug traffickers are intensifying a bloody war against journalists. One nation, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, was characterized as having the world's first `` narco-military'' leader in Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` Routinely our problems have been with governments that have restricted press freedoms and jailed journalists,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaton </PERSON>, the new president of <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now the worst problems we face are caused by forces independent of government, narcotics traffickers and insurgents, who go after journalists and censor by terror,'' said <PERSON> Seaton </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> -RRB- Mercury and officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Seaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seaton </PERSON> said journalists' main weapon in the fight for press freedoms is moral pressure. The <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION>, which met this week in this northern Mexican city, is a leading free-press advocate. `` Governments sometimes respond,'' he said. The drug cartels have n't, however. Cartels Tuesday gunned down two officials of the daily Colombian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The newspaper has crusaded against drug trafficking; its main <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> office was recently bombed. Also shot to death the same day in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> was the director of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Cronista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrata </ORGANIZATION>. Police there could not confirm if his slaying was linked to drug traffickers. Nine Colombian journalists have been slain the past six months, said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON>'s owner. Just one day before the attacks, <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> pleaded with <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> members to find a way `` to combat this tremendous scourge.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> told members: `` I want to confess that, yes, we're afraid. We're scared to death. Journalists here expressed fear that traffickers would begin terrorizing journalists in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` I feel that in just a short time something will happen,'' said <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Canelas </PERSON> of the daily <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempos </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is living the darkest moment in its history ... Liberty of expression does not exist,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON>, executive director of the daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. La Prensa, along with every other major independent Panamanian news medium, has been shut down by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was called `` the world's first narco-military'' leader by <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s crackdown on the press began after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government accused him of being an international drug dealer and escalated after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> held elections that were widely denounced as fraudulent. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> commission </ORGANIZATION>, speculated that narcotics traffickers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> timed this week's attacks to coincide with the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` They're trying to produce even more public impact,'' said <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON>, of the daily Costa Rican newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> said in its final report that although `` some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination.'' Chilean and <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> journalists are seeing signs of restored press freedoms for the first time since longtime dictators <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> imposed severe restrictions. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, the two leading candidates in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s Dec. 14 elections _ the first since <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 1973 military coup _ have been recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> for their struggle to re-establish press freedoms. New President <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> has `` taken the necessary steps to reinstate freedom to Paraguayan journalism,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> of the daily <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asuncion </ORGANIZATION>, closed under former President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s regime. And there is `` a window of hope'' for improved freedom of expression in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> after next year's elections, said <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> noted that new Argentine President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has begun privatizing state television stations and making other moves to advance press freedom. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> chose his address to the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> meeting to announce the government would privatize the state newsprint monopoly. The company has been used in the past to harass independent newspapers by not providing them with newsprint. The <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> administration also this year has arrested a former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> director and accused him in the slaying five years ago of a well-known <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> journalist. Government press restrictions have worsened in some countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hait </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON>. `` In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists ... is worse than ever,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the press is caught in the crossfire between the government and either drug cartels or rebels, <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the government of President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> wants to protect the press, but the structures of terrorism instituted by former military governments are deeply rooted, <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>64 Dead in Guerrilla Attacks A Month Before Elections</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wave of leftist rebel attacks and clashes with security forces in highland and coastal areas this week has left more than 64 people dead, including three mayors, authorities said Friday. The government says the Maoist Shining Path rebels are attempting to sabotage municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12 by assassinating officials and attacking government facilities. This week's attacks coincided with a meeting of the Group of Eight Latin American presidents, which took place Wednesday and Thursday in <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION>, 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Rebel attacks left 35 people dead, including 17 guerrillas, since Thursday, authorities said. With a total of 64 dead, this is the heaviest week of violence since the army reported killing more than 200 rebels in a series of encounters in July. In the latest incident, the government said in a communique issued through the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> that 14 Shining Path guerrillas were killed and a policeman was wounded in a battle Friday near <LOCATION> Antauta </LOCATION>, 590 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The mayor of <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, a jungle city 240 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, was fatally shot by guerrillas Thursday as he walked near his home, according to a government spokesman. Rebels also assassinated the mayor of <LOCATION> Jauja </LOCATION>, 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Thursday. On Tuesday, rebels killed the mayor of <LOCATION> Ananea </LOCATION>, 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, in addition to the town's police chief and nine policemen. The assassinations bring to at least 56 the number of mayors killed in political violence in the last five years. Twenty-seven of them died this year. Police said other Shining Path rebels toppled two power pylons in the central highlands Thursday night, causing a total blackout in and around the <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, a city 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. During the blackout, rebels using dynamite bombs attacked an army barracks, two police posts, government offices, banks, schools and the local newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correo </ORGANIZATION>. One child was killed in one of 40 blasts reported by police, and two policemen were attacked and killed. Rebels also blew up seven power pylons near <LOCATION> Huaraz </LOCATION>, 190 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION>, knocking out power to a region with more than 100,000 inhabitants, according to police. The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency in 1980 in the mountains near <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, and now operates in most of the highlands, the coca-producing jungles in the northeast and in some areas of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s coastline. The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the violence since 1980, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials and civilians.

 Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> continued eating a hamburger in a restaurant as it was held up by a gunman who fired two shots before running outside and shooting a fleeing witness in the leg. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON>, the governor's chief of staff, said <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> was not fazed _ or injured _ in the holdup Thursday night. `` The governor is out in front at the counter eating and he said he heard this guy -LRB- yelling -RRB- and he said that he just continued eating his hamburger,'' <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON> said. `` He said the guy left and he kept eating his hamburger, and then he left,'' <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON> said.

 A federal appeals court ruled Friday that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is not a flight risk and ordered a judge to set bail for the former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent whose 1986 espionage conviction was overturned this year. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed a detention order issued by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> after <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s conviction was overturned <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has been in federal custody since his 1984 arrest. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, in a federal prison in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, reacted with `` very guarded optimism'' because of past disappointments in the case, defense attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He's very anxious to get out,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> expects <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to be transferred back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a bail hearing soon now that the case has been returned to federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The appeals court said the government has failed to prove <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is a risk to flee. The order returns the case to <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> to impose `` appropriate release conditions.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is the only <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent convicted of espionage. The 20-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> veteran was convicted of delivering secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents to his lover, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a Russian emigre who pleaded guilty with her husband, <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON>, to espionage. The Ogorodnikovs are serving federal prison terms. A jury deadlocked in <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s first trial, but a second jury found him guilty and <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> sentenced him to two life prison terms plus 50 years. The appeals court overturned the conviction in April on grounds that <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> erred in admitting lie detector evidence in the second trial in 1985-86. The court ordered a new trial for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, and the government appealed. In July, lawyers for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> sought to have him freed on bail pending the appeal, but <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ruled he was a flight risk and denied bail. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> turned down the government appeal in August, and prosecutors have not indicated whether they will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> or try <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> again. During <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s two trials, the prosecution depicted him as a bitter man who was reprimanded for ineptitude. They said he was easily recruited in the summer of 1984 by Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and her husband. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> went into an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office on Sept. 27, 1984, and revealed his relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>. He claimed he was trying to redeem his career by infiltrating the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutors charged that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> planned to travel to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to meet with Soviet intelligence agents. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents grilled <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for four days as Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> frantically called his <LOCATION> Lynwood </LOCATION> home and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> to try to locate him. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> arrested Oct. 2, 1984.

 <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest advertising agencies, pleaded innocent Friday to charges it paid nearly $ 1 million in bribes to Jamaican officials for the island's lucrative tourism campaign Two of the company's executives and a former executive also pleaded innocent Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Two Jamaicans charged with accepting the bribes, former Minister of Tourism <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were not in court. Arrest warrants were issued for the two, but have not been served, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will begin extradition proceedings against them because they have n't surrendered voluntarily, he said. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in a telephone interview Friday that he saw no barriers to extraditing <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>. `` Usually we cooperate as much as possible,'' <PERSON> Rattray </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there would be a problem.'' <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>' lawyer <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabdoub </PERSON> has denied that <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> received kickbacks for awarding the tourism board's account to <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Rubicam </LOCATION>. The case was poorly investigated `` with malice in mind,'' <PERSON> Dabdoub </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> held the post from 1981-84. He is now a tourism consultant for several <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>, now president of the <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION>, says he was never a government official or adviser, and denies that illegal payments were made. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> faces up to $ 7.5 million in fines if it is convicted. Young & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> still holds the <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> account, which won praise for its theme `` Come Back to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>,'' and has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. `` We will be pressing for an early trial date, so we can present our evidence and get this matter resolved,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> in a statement. `` We expect to be found innocent.'' The New York-based agency, along with Executive Vice President <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> and former Vice President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangenberg </PERSON>, were indicted last week on charges of racketeering and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, a company senior vice president, was charged with perjury. The Jamaicans were both charged with racketeering. The case is believed to the first attempt to use the Racketeering Influence Corrupt Organizations Act against an advertising agency. The indictment alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 900,000 in bribes to <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> over 5 -LCB- years starting in 1981. In return, the indictment alleged, <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> got the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s ad account, which prosecutors say generated $ 3.75 million in commissions for the agency. The government alleged that the payments were funneled to <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> through a sham advertising agency set up by <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> that had secret bank accounts in the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The indictment said <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> should be considered a public official because he `` acted in an official capacity'' on behalf of <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> as an advisor to the Jamaican government on tourism matters, including the selection of an advertising agency for the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>, which called the charges `` without substance or merit,'' acknowledges it made payments to Ad Ventures, a company controlled by <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>. The agency says Ad Ventures provided various services for the Jamaican account, and maintains it had no reason to believe that <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> could be considered a public official under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. `` Young and <PERSON> Rubicam </PERSON> made very simple, conventional, legitimate business arrangements in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, the agency's lawyer, said after the arraignments Friday. The government's entire case, built during a three-year investigation, depends on its characterization of <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> as a public official, which the company will challenge, he said. The <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> investigation stemmed from an unrelated probe of illegal tax shelters. Best-selling novelist <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, author of `` The French Connection'' and `` The Green Berets,'' pleaded guilty here to tax charges in the tax probe, and cooperated with federal investigators when they turned their attention to the <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> dealings. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose business dealings in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> date back 40 years, is described in the indictment as a middleman who helped steer the <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> account to <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> and then helped pass money between the agency and <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>. <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> profited from the dealings but will not be charged. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> set bond at $ 10,000 for the three executives and told them they must notify the court before traveling outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The case has been assigned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> opposes a reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to bring about Israeli-Palestinian talks as the first step toward a peace settlement, a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabbo </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-man Executive Committee, said he's against talks that do n't include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` This plan is not acceptable to us at all because it is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that appoints its own representatives to any negotiations,'' he told <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli proposals `` have only one aim and that is to waste time,'' <PERSON> Abd-Rabbo </PERSON> said after arriving in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> for meetings with Egyptian officials. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the plan proposed by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would have <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> consult with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the composition of their delegation and would have <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agree to the dialogue only if it is satisfied with the choice of the Palestinian negotiators. The Israeli plan <PERSON> Abd-Rabbo </PERSON> referred to was in May by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for Palestinian elections in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> sector who would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on interim autonomy.

The talks began in December after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. Four rounds have been held so far. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five-point plan has not been officially disclosed. But officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said it sought to reconcile Israeli and Egyptian views on a proposed Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> suggested he and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in two weeks for talks. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> advanced his plan after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision-making inner <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> rejected last Friday an <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> proposal for an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> objected mainly to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s suggestion that the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation include members from outside the occupied territories, possibly activists deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> saw it as a ploy to bring the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to the negotiating table. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is to meet Sunday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, to review all peace ideas of past months and is expected to issue a policy statement.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said Friday that he may declare a state of emergency to prevent a walkout at a U.S.-based banana and real estate company from becoming a nationwide strike. `` We will act with responsibility.

About 11,000 workers at Castle & amp; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> have been on strike since Oct. 3. The Workers Confederation and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which together have 500,000 members, said Friday they will join the strike Monday. `` I wo n't stand for any type of threats. The problem was not created by the government,'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would not put up with a general strike for even a week. Because of this, we could declare a national state of emergency or assume other positions.'' Castle & amp; <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, has operated in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since the turn of the century and sells about 60 percent of the nation's banana exports. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> exports 50 million 100-pound boxes annually.

The union rejected the action, saying <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> law stipulates that pay raises accompany transfers. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> on Monday ordered the workers back on the job and the company not to take punitive measures.

<TEXT>
 The minister of government and justice in the Cabinet controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resigned without explanation Friday as the regime prepared to purge `` disloyal'' public employees. Meanwhile, the opposition said it was willing to talk about new elections if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> steps down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a condition the government rejected in unsuccessful negotiations in August. Justice ministry spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said an official explanation for the resignation of Minister <PERSON> Olmedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> would be given later. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> was appointed Sept. 3, two days after provisional President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> took office. The provisional government was created when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled the May 7 elections, which independent observers said the opposition won by a landslide. The public payroll includes nearly 140,000 people and one-third may be fired in the next few weeks. Earlier this week, the government announced tough measures that, among other things, make it easy for the government to dismiss employees considered disloyal. Official reports said many public employees celebrated on Oct. 3 when rebels tried to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and runs the country. `` Every public employee must watch out for traitors that are infiltrated,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told supporters two days after the botched coup. `` We are going to make a list.'' New laws also have frozen pay, suspended Christmas bonuses and forbidden political activity by professional and business associations. The government said the intent was `` preserving national sovereignty and defending the economy'' in the face of `` aggression by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988 on federal charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. He denies the charges.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Friday it continues to believe there is no fundamental right to abortion but told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> state restrictions on abortions for minors may be upheld on narrower grounds. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> submitted a `` friend-of-the-court'' legal brief in defense of a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requiring some girls to tell both parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion. The administration may be taking a somewhat more moderate position than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did when it urged the justices to overturn their 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling, which legalized abortions nationwide. But women's rights activists promptly denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` This is another last-minute attack on women's lives from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. `` Obviously the president and the attorney general are ignoring the massive public outcry to keep abortion legal. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has received the message recently. But where's <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, said the brief was `` excellent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We continue to believe that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> was wrongly decided and should be overruled. There is, in view of the nation's history and traditions, no fundmamental right to abortion.'' But Solicitor General <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and other department lawyers said <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s parental notification regulations withstand attack on narrower grounds. `` There is utterly no support for the proposition that a minor has a fundamental right to keep her parents in the dark about her welfare,'' the department's brief said. `` A state may reasonably conclude that a minor's parents are, as a general matter, better suited to make these critical decisions than a minor and her physician, or a minor and her physician in conjunction with a judge,'' the department said. The brief also attacked a crucial underpinning of Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s analysis of abortion regulations. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the high court's pivotal member on abortion, has stopped short of voting to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Instead, she has often endorsed state abortion restrictions on grounds they do not pose `` an undue burden'' to the fundamental right created by the 1973 ruling. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> brief said, `` The undue burden analysis begs the question at issue: whether there is a fundamental right at stake that requires'' courts to view with heightened skepticism any regulation limiting access to abortions. `` We do not believe, upon full reflection, that the undue burden inquiry can legitimately substitute for a standard of review,'' the department lawyers said. `` The analysis can not assist in distinguishing between fundamental rights and other liberty interests.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> cast the deciding vote July 3, when the high court upheld <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> regulations limiting access to abortion. That 5-4 ruling permitted the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision to stand but gave states new power to limit a woman's right to have an abortion. The justices have three cases, including the one from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, on their docket this term. They are reviewing an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law, similar to the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> statute, that requires doctors to notify one parent of unmarried, minor girls before performing abortions. The third case, from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, will test whether states can impose strict new licensing requirements on abortion clinics that could force them to become what one judge said was `` the functional equivalent of small hospitals.'' The court will hear arguments in the three cases in November and December and is expected to decide them by July.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> said Friday she is looking forward to a future at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> beyond her role as co-anchor of the morning `` Today'' show. But in a speech to 300 woman managers, the popular TV personality did not say what type of work she would do in the news division. `` My horizons have expanded,'' <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> said at a luncheon address to women executives in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>. `` It's no longer <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, ` Today' show. Now it's <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Imagine the possibilities. `` For the first time in 4,750 days, I'm thinking beyond today. I'm looking toward tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who declined to answer reporters' questions afterward. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who turns 39 in two weeks and celebrated her 13th anniversary with `` Today'' on Wednesday, alluded several times in the 20-minute speech to her impending career change. Her next move has been the subject of speculation since `` Sunrise'' anchor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> joined the `` Today'' show. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>, 31, was given a $ 1 million salary in swapping duties with `` Today'' news anchor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> in August. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who makes $ 1.2 million per year, has two years on her NBC News contract, and she told the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week that she intends to stay with the network, although she will probably leave `` Today'' by the end of the year. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> has said there is no friction between herself and <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>, nor with co-anchor <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, although she told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> it `` was a real blow'' to hear that <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> and <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> had switched jobs. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s latest statement, issued Wednesday, said, `` Conversations about specifics are concluding now and we expect to announce our mutual plans shortly.''

<HEAD>Lifeguard Serves One-Day Sentence for Rape Conviction</HEAD>

 A lifeguard who pleaded guilty to raping an 11-year-old girl at a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> is free after serving only one day of a three-day sentence. <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> pleaded guilty in August to second-degree rape, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He had been accused of raping the girl in an equipment room at the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YMCA </LOCATION>. `` I'm appalled,'' <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfaden </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, said after <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s release. `` This is not justice.'' State sentencing guidelines for <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who had no previous record, were four to nine years. In a presentencing report, a probation officer recommended 18 months in jail. But <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cave </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 6 sentenced <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 21, to five years in prison with all but three days suspended. Cave also placed <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> on three years supervised probation, ordered him to perform 1,000 hours of community service and told him to have no unsupervised contact with young girls. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resident, was released from the county jail after spending only one day in jail. Inmates typically serve one-third of their sentence. Cave said it was it one of the most difficult sentences he ever had to hand down. But he said giving <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> a long prison term `` would n't benefit him and may conceivably have a disastrous effect.'' `` Incarceration will not restore that which was taken from her,'' he said. `` Incarceration will not in my opinion, deter other people from -LRB- committing rape -RRB- because they do not think of that at the time.'' Before announcing the sentence, <PERSON> Cave </PERSON> said, `` I'm not unmindful that this sounds like a lack of concern or consideration on behalf of -LRB- the victim -RRB-. I certainly do n't mean it to be that way.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s attorney, Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Coon </PERSON>, said at the sentencing that <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had expressed `` true remorse'' for what happened. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> asked Cave to sentence <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> within the state guidelines, four to nine years. She said the victim, a sixth-grader who told police she had a crush on <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, was not expecting to have sex when she went into the room with him in October 1988. `` Before she knew it, it was happening,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was arrested in January after authorities at the girl's school learned about the incident and called the police

 Other books have detailed extramarital affairs involving the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, but the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s autobiography was written from the inside. Unlike the other books' authors, <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> is neither a historian nor a journalist, but a former confidante of King. And the book's publication has opened a rift in what was King's inner circle more than two decades ago. `` The other people in the movement have not written -LRB- such -RRB- books at all; none of us have described what's alleged here,'' former King aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Friday. In `` And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said King `` had a weakness for women.'' He wrote that King spent part of the last night of his life in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, with two women, then fought with a third who'd been looking for him. Civil rights leaders, including King aides <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, denounced the book Thursday, calling on <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> to repudiate it and expressing doubt he'd written `` the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> section.'' On Friday, about two dozen people, including <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> black leaders, gathered at King's first church in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to call for a boycott of the book. `` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is like <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. You've got your Judases,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s black caucus, said at Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church. Other King historians, including Pulitzer Prize-winners <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrow </PERSON>, have written King had a predilection for women. In `` Parting the Waters: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the King Years,'' Branch wrote how King's inner circle _ including <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and others _ was defined by an adjustment each made to <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s private life. `` These were people who tolerated or even applauded <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s demon delights as a humanizing revelation that bonded them even closer to him and his public purpose,'' Branch wrote. `` They objected to King's mistresses no more than to the scores of concubines who had soothed King <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Garrow </PERSON> also dealt with the subject in `` Bearing the Cross: <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` They were not participants,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` But this is not only a participant, but a close friend, a leader within the movement.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olivet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and a friend of <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, told him in a letter that he should have higher standards than others who've written about King <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Garrow </PERSON> and others may focus on <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s sex life, `` you and I must forever focus on his spiritual genius.'' The letter was released Friday by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an insurance executive who is chairman of the board of The King Center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and who spoke for <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and others in denouncing the book Thursday. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said he was `` hurt that someone so close to Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> and so critical to our struggle for civil rights would attempt to discredit Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> and our movement in this way.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> also said he objects to `` the specific stories'' _ <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s woman-by-woman account of King's last night. `` Taylor Branch does n't go into the gory detail,'' he said. `` I'm for not distorting the truth,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` Whether this is true or not true should n't take anything away from the leadership the man provided this nation.'' A prominent black <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> attorney, J.L. Chestnut, complained Thursday that <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> `` should not be throwing stones about other people,'' in light of reports about his own past. According to Branch's book, a flamboyant <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, man armed with a hatchet once chased <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> and complained the minister had been sleeping with his wife since she was 15. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> refused to sign a complaint against the man. `` Some years later,'' Branch wrote, `` King confided to a colleague that he not only had known of <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>'s extramarital liaisons in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, but had joined in some of them himself.'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> has not returned repeated calls from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> seeking elaboration on his book and comment on reaction to it. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row, the book's publisher, have said the words are his own. <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> spoke with reporters in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> on Thursday, where he was promoting the book. He told them he was no betrayer of King and that he resents accusations that strokes and brain surgery have left his mind impaired. `` I'm not <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I know who I am. I'm a Christian minister. ... I am most surprised anybody would think I'm mentally incompetent.''

<HEAD>Two White Police Officers Indicted on Charges They Hit Black Teen-Agers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two white police officers were indicted Friday on battery and other charges for allegedly hitting two black teen-agers, then forcing them out of a squad car in a white neighborhood where they were beaten by residents. The August incident and another in which a black man was shot to death by police sparked allegations of police racism and prompted <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> hearings on police brutality. But <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s chief prosecutor on Friday cautioned against concluding the officers were racist. `` Why must it be put in a racial context?'' State's Attorney <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> said at a news conference announcing the indictments. `` That's part of the problem in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> today. Everything is being put in a racial context.'' The officers _ <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Serio </PERSON>, 35 _ were each charged with two counts of official misconduct, a felony, and one count of misdemeanor battery. They will be suspended without pay, said police spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Camden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Serio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> allegedly picked the 14-year-old boys up for a curfew violation outside of <LOCATION> Comiskey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> shortly after an Aug. 15 White Sox game. The standard procedure in curfew violations is to take the offender home. But, according to prosecutors, the officers instead drove the boys to a white neighborhood not far from the ballpark. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> hit the boys before forcing them out of the patrol car, prosecutors said. The boys were then beaten by a group of residents who were later charged with aggravated battery and ethnic intimidation, said state's attorney spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>. Each misconduct charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. The battery count is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. Although <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is the officer accused of hitting the boys, <PERSON> Serio </PERSON> also faces the charge because he `` could have intervened and did not,'' said <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>. Arraignment was set for Nov. 9. The officers will not be arrested before then because they are not considered at risk to leave the jurisdiction, he said. In the second case of alleged brutality, 24-year-old <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> was shot to death on a South Side street by a police officer. Police maintain that <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> was shot while trying to grab the officer's gun. But other witnesses have said that was not the case. The man's family has filed a $ 5 million civil rights lawsuit against the officer.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who refused to dissect a frog in her high school biology class because it violated her beliefs, is the subject of a television dramatization aimed at her fellow students. `` Frog Girl: The <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' will be broadcast Tuesday afternoon in the `` CBS Schoolbreak Special,'' a one-hour show that details Miss <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s refusal to compromise her belief that all life is sacred. The show, starring <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> as her mother <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, has a script by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreet </PERSON> that keeps its focus on the story and avoids the issue-of-the-week feel that many such shows carry. The show was directed by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreet </PERSON> and camerawork was by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntleroy </PERSON>, whose wife, actress Lesley-Anne Down, was so taken by a reading of the script that she volunteered for a bit part. `` I respect other people's beliefs, I just want mine respected too,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> in a recent interview. She is now 18 and a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> with an undeclared major. In the spring of 1987, her biology teacher and principal at <ORGANIZATION> Victor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and its governing board, refused a request from Miss <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and her attorneys to perform some alternate work instead of dissecting a frog that had been raised and killed specifically for lab science. `` I was trying to make it obvious that I would do just as much work, if not more,'' she said. `` I felt like I was talking to a wall. I was compared to a kid who did n't want to sit next to a black person in typing class and someone who did n't want to run in PE.'' All of that just one month after starting school as a transfer student from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where she and her mother reached a compromise with teachers when she refused a lab dissection in 7th grade. There was initially no room for compromise at <ORGANIZATION> Victor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, located in the high desert community of <LOCATION> Victorville </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said she suffered depression and her grades dropped while she received international attention in the spring of 1987 as the `` Frog Girl'' _ a term she loathes. `` Different schools act differently,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` But look at the good it -LRB- the controversy -RRB- did. It passed a bill for the whole state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' She was referring to the `` Students Rights Bill,'' which permits students morally opposed to dissection to refrain from it in return for equivalent work. But the bill took effect Jan. 1 of this year _ too late to help <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who was stuck with a `` C'' on her transcript for the biology class, down from an `` A.'' A lawsuit was dismissed in August of 1988 when a federal judge accepted the high school's offer of substituting photographs of a frog which had died a natural death. But Miss <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> objected, saying she was dissatisfied with how the school would guarantee the frog was not killed. An appeal continues. Although she said she `` never lost a single friend'' over the controversy, she is happy to resume anonymity as a college student. `` No one even recognizes me, and I do n't mind a bit, to tell you the truth.'' Since her exposure to the power of media, she said she has gained an interest in marketing and advertising. `` There are not many people who have the courage to do as she did, and stand by her convictions,'' said Miss Down, who briefly appears in the show as a witness before a legislative committee considering the Students Rights Bill. `` It's hard enough to do when you are a grownup, but when you are a kid, that makes you something pretty special,'' Miss Down said. `` The lesson this teaches young people is invaluable.''

<HEAD>A New York ``Street Scene'' Takes Shape in London</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inside a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> rehearsal hall lurk the tempestuous passions of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tenement. `` Dere's been a moider,'' one actor cries in his best Noo Yawk mimicry, while another gets advice on the correct way to say `` shirt torn'': `` It's not very articulate. It's like ` shirddorn,''' says dialogue coach <PERSON> Charmian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoare </PERSON>. The moment is the tragic second-act climax of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s 1947 `` Street Scene,'' the German composer's look at sultry summertime life in the Big Apple slums. The show, which has had a checkered history, is readying its professional <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> debut with an Anglo-American creative team. `` This is totally unique; I've never done anything like it,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soprano <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciesinksi </PERSON>. She sings the role of the doomed <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurrant </PERSON>, the wife whose adultery leads to her `` moider,'' or murder. Internationally known English bass <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> sings the part of her vengeful husband, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a Scot, is their daughter, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Ciesinski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> appeared in the production's British premiere at the <LOCATION> Scottish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> last May. That was the first professional British production of a work whose exposure here has been limited to school stagings and a one-night charity benefit. Now, restaged and somewhat recast after <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, `` Street Scene'' joins <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s English National Opera repertory for an Oct. 17 opening. Briton <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pountney </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ENO </ORGANIZATION>'s director of productions, again directs. American conductor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is new to the venture in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> became famous for his collaboration with the playwright <PERSON> Bertolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON> on such works as `` The Threepenny Opera.'' With his wife, the singer <PERSON> Lotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenya </PERSON>, he emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1935. He died in 1950. `` Street Scene'' reunites conductor <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> with a show he first saw in its Broadway premiere, when he was 11. He went on to be a repetiteur -LRB- coach -RRB- on its 1959 revival at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, where the show is once again in the repertory this autumn. `` In a way, this is a funny full circle,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said of his current assignment. He said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ENO </ORGANIZATION>'s artistic director, telephoned and suggested the idea. `` I said, ` This is madness, but I'd love to, for nostalgia.''' `` Street Scene'' has traditionally confounded purists with its blend of operatic bravura and populist Broadway savvy. The show has a knockout dance number, `` Moon-faced, starry-eyed,'' right out of Broadway's golden age. But its choral passages and arias recall the lyricism of another hybrid, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>'s 1935 `` Porgy and <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>.'' And despite its lowlife setting, `` Street Scene'' has more sentiment than did <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s earlier hard-edged collaborations with <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>, `` Mahagonny'' which was recently restaged in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and `` The Threepenny Opera,'' due on Broadway in November, starring pop singer Sting. Audiences initially found `` Street Scene'' perplexing. `` It was very unconventional,'' explained <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has a separate career composing and conducting music for film classics such as <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gance </PERSON>'s `` Napoleon'' and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>'s `` City Lights.'' `` At the same time, it had elements that made it attractive for an opera company _ long developed passages for legitimate opera voices for which all of the formulas of Broadway musicals are swept aside.'' `` Street Scene'' is only the second ENO production of a work that originated on Broadway. It will play in repertory with such operatic warhorses as <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` A Masked Ball'' and <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` Madam Butterfly. Is it opera or musical? <PERSON> Pountney </PERSON> says it does n't matter. `` Opera has been so many different things in its life from what <PERSON> Monteverdi </PERSON> wrote to what <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> wrote to what <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> wrote,'' said the Cambridge-educated director. `` To me, anything which combines theater and music might as well be called opera as anything else.'' <PERSON> Ciesinski </PERSON> said the show combined `` humor, tragedy, Broadway dancing, blues, jazz, operatic singing _ all of them built up so it flows along very naturally.'' <PERSON> Ciesinksi </PERSON>, who is married to British baritone <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, is making her <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> debut with `` Street Scene.'' She returns to ENO next year to sing two heavyweight roles: <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>'s Salome and <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s Lady Macbeth. `` That's more my normal meat and potatoes, so this is sort of unusual: to create something very natural and moving _ not a crazy, bitchy lady,'' she said. And although she also sings Salome in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> in December, she is pleased to be based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: `` Being an opera singer is more of a way of life here; in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I ca n't even get a credit card.''

 <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Davoudian </PERSON>, 66 years old and fighting cancer, moved from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for expensive, specialized treatment in an attempt to save his life. He put all his savings in a local savings bank, <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> _ the one with a profile of <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on the doorknobs. He told the tellers it was for his cancer treatments, and the tellers told him the money was as safe as it could be. But they did n't tell him the whole story. What he thought was a secure, insured account turned out to be a risky junk bond in a high-flying <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> real estate developer, now bankrupt. <PERSON> Davoudian </PERSON> lost $ 50,000 _ almost all he had. Stuck in a foreign country without insurance and so broke he had to sell his car, <PERSON> Davoudian </PERSON> wonders how he'll pay for his next treatments, how he'll survive. `` I guess I'll do what other poor people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> do, whatever that is,'' <PERSON> Davoudian </PERSON> said. `` Now I know they cheated me 100 percent. But who can help me?'' His is a cry repeated across <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> these days, where the speculative tactics of the now-failed <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, its Arizona-based parent company and its chairman have left more than 22,000 depositors, two-thirds of them elderly, short $ 200 million in life savings. Some ca n't afford nursing homes now. Some have lost their own homes. Some even blame heart attacks and thoughts of suicide on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boszak </PERSON>, 69, lost $ 110,000 and ca n't pay for his wife's surgery <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> lost $ 50,000 and had to take in a boarder to make ends meet. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, 77, saw $ 42,000, set aside for his grandchildren's education, wiped out. <PERSON> Duk </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 65, saved $ 195,000 from his cleaning business. It's all gone. `` I have always told my children that this adopted country of mine was made of honest and blessed people,'' the Korean native said. `` Now it seems I have inadvertently lied to my children.'' What makes the plight of <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and the others unique is that they are, in a sense, among the first ordinary, everyday victims of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis. Except for stockholders or other investors in S & amp; Ls themselves, federal deposit insurance has protected most depositors from the widespread debacles and, in some cases, outright fraud. `` This one -LRB- <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> -RRB- was more heartless than the rest. Others just robbed the entire public at large,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rus </PERSON>, an attorney representing some of the 22,000, including a blind woman who took a bus to the bank and was sold the bonds. The investors say they thought they were putting their money in safe certificates of deposit at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, a 29-branch thrift where deposits were insured by the federal government. Instead of insured CDs, what they really bought were high-yielding subordinated debentures _ `` junk bonds'' _ in <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Phoenix-based real estate developer run by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. In April, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection and suspended interest payments on the bonds, now in default. Federal regulators then took control of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, which they say may prove to be the biggest S & amp; L failure ever, costing the government $ 2.5 billion. Regulators said CD holders were protected by deposit insurance; bondholders were on their own. Since the bondholders are at the end of the line in bankruptcy court, experts say their paper is virtually worthless. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officers declined comment for this story because of pending lawsuits over the losses. In the past <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has denied doing anything wrong. He blamed federal regulators for what he called harassment. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> wants to know more and voted last week to subpoena <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, along with federal and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state thrift regulators, to testify at hearings on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s problems. In an interview, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> said the firm's `` whole goal is to reorganize and pay off the bondholders.'' Back in the heady, rapid-growth days, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> lobbies were filled with signs touting the bonds, which paid about 2 percentage points above CDs and were sold in denominations as little as $ 1,000. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> tellers tried to steer customers to the bonds, bondholders say. Sales calls were placed to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> depositors shortly before large CDs were up for renewal. The bonds were n't insured, underwritten by a brokerage house or even traded on an open market like other junk bonds. They were supposed to be sold only by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> employees stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> branches, but some investors say <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> tellers sold them the bonds. Interest could be deposited right into <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> savings accounts. `` They said this is our mother company and it's as good as <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, and it's got billions of dollars in assets,'' said <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSio </PERSON>, who deposited his $ 25,000 lump-sum pension in the bonds. `` They never told me it was not insured. I've been very prudent all my life. I do n't risk money.'' <PERSON> DeSio </PERSON> said he was n't given a prospectus _ which does say the bonds were uninsured _ until weeks after the sale. But bondholders who did ask specifically if the bonds were covered by federal deposit insurance say they never were told, `` No.'' `` They said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON> backed the bonds. They said the bank would have to fail, and the bank is insured by the government,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION> attorney who invested $ 100,000. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> shared the same red, white and blue logo, and bondholders said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> went out of its way to show the savings bank and <ORGANIZATION> ACC </ORGANIZATION> were one and the same. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> representatives sometimes went behind the counter to help cash checks when lines grew long. Some customers were allowed to transfer CDs that had not yet matured to the bonds _ without the penalty for early withdrawal. Some even said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> tellers offered to come to their house to pick up a check for the bonds. `` There was such a commingling of efforts that you did n't know where <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> ended and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> started,'' said <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>. Bondholders and attorneys say they believe <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> targeted the elderly. `` It was simply a case of a greedy man who thought he could defraud and deceive the elderly,'' said <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a bondholder who has organized a group of 200 at Leisure World, a giant retirement community outside <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Scams come into Leisure World and we hear about them all the time,'' she said. `` Scams do n't usually come in through the banks.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> remained silent today on a $ 7 billion proposed buyout by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> amid reports the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is seeking help from unions and billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a hearing is scheduled Monday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on legislation proposed this week that would give the government more authority to review airline buyouts. In early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 3.625 a share to $ 102.375, still well below the $ 120 per share offered by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, but the second straight day of an increase. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.625 to close at $ 98.75 as 1.6 million shares changed hands. On Wednesday, the price had fallen $ 4.25 a share. Financial analysts have said the stock will continue to trade far below the level of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer until there is a significant move by either side. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s pilots union about a possible employee-management buyout designed to fend off <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer. The buyout would include significant participation by the pilots union and the unions representing Machinists and flight attendants at American, the Times said. Pilots union officials did not return calls seeking comment. The other two unions previously have said they have discussed possible responses to the Trump offer. The Times, quoting an unidentified Wall Street source, said the <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> buyout would be similar to a pending pilot-management bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Previous reports have said the pilots at American were asked prior to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s bid to study a possible buyout. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that aides to <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> had indicated the secretive investor might be willing to help <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> fend off <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Bass officials refused to comment on the report. AMR, parent of the nation's largest and most profitable airline, has remained silent on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer since it was revealed Oct. 5, saying it will respond `` in due course.'' The next scheduled meeting of the board of directors is Oct. 18. Trump officials said Thursday there `` is nothing new to report.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> said there had been no contact between the two sides. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer is set to expire Oct. 20. AMR, while refusing to discuss its own proposed takeover, said Thursday it had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> `` to make fundamental changes'' in the air service agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> before allowing <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to participate in a leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. Under the proposed $ 6.75 billion buyout, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would end up with 15 percent of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, while employees would own 75 percent and management 10 percent. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> shareholders voted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today to approve the airline's 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, which would cost it $ 750 million. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> deal `` represents a unilateral opening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation markets.'' AMR spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said the company believes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should require <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to ease access to its markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said American has been stymied in its efforts to launch Chicago-London and New York-Manchester routes because `` the British government is one of the most restrictive in the world'' in allowing foreign carriers access to its markets.

 Wheat futures prices moved slightly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, today while corn and soybean futures firmed after opening lower in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest crop report. The government's new crop estimates for corn and soybeans came in higher than expected at 7.45 billion bushels and 1.93 billion bushels respectively. The 1989 wheat-crop estimate of 2.04 billion bushels was below expectations, as was the government's projection that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stocks would total 443 million bushels next May 31, the end of the current marketing year, compared with 698 million bushels at the end of the 1988-89 marketing year. `` If there was a surprise in the report, it was probably in the wheat,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Those wheat stocks are fairly tight.''

<HEAD>Mortgage-Backed Securities High Fliers This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The top-performing fixed-income investments for the first nine months of the year were mortgage-backed securities, <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says, but these tricky investments are n't for everyone. Mortgage-backed securities are bond-like investments derived from the monthly payments made on home mortgages. These securities offer high yields and are considered extremely safe, but they have disadvantages. Among them are an uncertain rate of repayment of an investor's money and an inexact maturity date. That's because homeowners do n't always make mortgage payments at a predictable rate, especially if the mortgages have an adjustable rate pegged to market interest rates. When interest rates rise, homeowners may slow down payments; when they fall, they may speed them up or refinance, meaning a security tied to their mortgages could be paid off sooner than the projected maturity. `` You get your money back early when you do n't want it early and you get it back late when you do n't want it back late,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a financial planner at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment adviser <ORGANIZATION> Brownson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehmus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Foxworth </PERSON>. When a security pays off sooner than expected, the investor is forced to come up with a new place to put the money that will earn a competitive rate of interest. That may be impossible when interest rates are declining. Mortgage-backed securities were introduced by the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, in 1970. <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, like its cousins <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, `` buys'' mortgage portfolios from savings and loans, which gives the thrifts more money to loan out. In turn, <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> repackages these mortgages and sells them to investors. Here's how it works: When Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> makes a monthly mortgage payment to <ORGANIZATION> Anytown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan, the cash is funneled by the thrift to <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>. This semi-autonomous government agency then passes along the cash _ after taking a cut _ to the buyer of the mortgage-backed security. According to <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, the total return of mortgage-backed securities _ interest payments plus any price appreciation _ outdistanced all other fixed-income investments such as corporate and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds from January to September, despite an increase in mortgage issues coming to the market. The main reason the increased supply failed to depress the price of these securities was that investment houses are tailoring these investments to the needs of particular investors, said <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Otterman </PERSON>. `` The ability to move these securities to new buyers was key,'' she said. The chief type of repackaged mortgage-backed security is called a collateralized mortgage obligation, or CMO. CMOs also are backed by the cash flow from a pool of mortgages. But unlike traditional mortgage-backed securities, the <ORGANIZATION> CMO </ORGANIZATION> pool is much larger and is divided into different payment `` streams,'' with a separate security tied to each of these cash flows from the mortgages. CMOs are structured so that they have a fixed coupon like a bond, meaning they make stable interest payments to the investor. By contrast, interest payments on traditional mortgage-backed securities are not as predictable. CMOs also are structured according to various maturities, so an investor may buy one according to how long he wants to lock up his money and where he thinks interest rates are headed. All of them have maturities shorter than the 30 years of a <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>. The repayment of a CMO investor's principal still is affected by the rate of payments made on the underlying mortgages, but the volatility is n't as great as with traditional mortgage-backed securities because the mortgage pool is much larger. Mortgage-backed securities are bought primarily by institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, but increasingly they are attracting individual investors, particularly for tax-sheltered retirement or pension accounts, according to the investment firm <PERSON> Gabriele </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hueglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON>. One reason mortgage-backed securities are not more attractive to individuals is their cost. Most are packaged in units of $ 25,000, although on the secondary market issues that have been around awhile and already repaid some of their principal may be bought for half that much, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. An easier and cheaper way for individual investors to get into the mortgage-backed market is through mutual funds that specialize in them <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, a spokesman for mutual-fund operator <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>'s mortgage-backed fund has been a popular place to put money from <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION>, but its high yield may attract other investors. <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>'s mortgage-backed fund has yielded 9.30 percent in recent days, while its <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond fund yielded 8.06 percent. This additional yield may make up for the potential of a decline in an investor's holding due to early payments made on the underlying mortgages, <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices declined broadly today as the market absorbed the news of a jump in the producer price index. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 19.88 points to 2,739.96 by noontime on Wall Street.

The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly reversing a series of declines through the summer months. At first, the market took the news with little evident concern. Analysts noted that a rise of about that size had been widely expected in the financial world.

<TEXT>
 Semiconductor maker <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Friday reported its profit in the third quarter dropped to about half of the year-ago amount, depressed by a one-time charge related to the end of a joint venture The computer chip maker reported that net income for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 72 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to $ 143 million, or 78 cents per share, for the same three months last year. Revenue totaled $ 771 million for the third quarter, down slightly from $ 785 million a year ago. The <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> company said in a news release that the net income figures `` reflect a previously announced $ 35 million charge against pre-tax income for anticipated costs'' associated with <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to end a computer systems venture with <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. The charge reduced earnings per share by 12 cents for the quarter. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said it earned $ 268 million, or $ 1.43 a share, down about 27 percent from $ 367 million, or $ 2.05 a share, a year earlier.

<HEAD>Pulitzer Posts 2.6 Percent Profit Pickup Despite Virtually Flat Revenue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pulitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Friday posted a 2.6 percent increase in its profit for the third quarter, which the media company said reflected cost-cutting and debt reduction efforts Revenue edged up just 0.2 percent for the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, and would have declined slightly if not not for one-time gains related to the company's conversion from independent newspaper carriers to a contract delivery system in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Pulitzer's net income came to $ 3.21 million, or 31 cents a share, compared to $ 3.13 million, or 30 cents a share, in 1988's third quarter Revenue for the quarter amounted to $ 94.61 million, up from $ 94.41 million for the same period a year ago. `` Despite a soft advertising market in the publishing and broadcasting industries during the third quarter, we continued to benefit from our debt reduction and cost-control efforts,'' Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a news release. He said the company decreased its net interest expense by $ 503,000 in the quarter as compared to the same period a year earlier. For the first nine months of this year, Pulitzer reported after-tax earnings of $ 13.18 million, or $ 1.26 a share, up nearly 10 percent from $ 11.99 million, or $ 1.15 a share, a year earlier. Revenue through three quarters of 1989 was $ 292 million, a gain of about 2.5 percent from the prior year's $ 285 million.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Rebound Sharply in September</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS pvs 8th graf, The stock, with market reversing early gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Wholesale prices shot up 0.9 percent in September, fueled by a sharp rise in energy costs, the government said today. The climb last month in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index wiped out consecutive price declines of 0.4 percent in August and July and 0.1 percent in June. The September reversal brought the annual wholesale inflation rate for the first nine months of the year to 5.1 percent and marked a return to the high inflation of the early part of the year. Although wholesale inflation is not nearly as bad as feared after prices advanced at a 10.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, it is still significantly higher than the 4.0 percent rate posted in all of 1988. Contributing to the big September jump was a statistical glitch in the measurement of auto prices, which were skewed because manufacturers offered their end-of-the-model-year price incentives earlier in the summer than usual. When month-to-month increases were adjusted for normal seasonal variations, auto prices rose 3.8 percent in September. When seasonal adjustments are factored out, auto prices actually declined 0.5 percent. `` We were due for a big rebound ... after several months of declines,'' said economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` ... I would not be particularly alarmed about this one-month spike up given the seasonal effect in autos and the spike in energy, which will probably be a one-time event.'' The stock market at first showed little reaction to the news as well as to a separate report showing stronger-than-expected retail sales last month. But by noon, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 19.88 points to 2739.96. Traders interpreted the reports as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would not soon lower interest rates. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst, roughly 0.8 percentage points of the 0.9 percent monthly rise in the inflation index was attributable to motor vehicles and energy. Energy prices, which had fallen in June, July and August, shot up 6.5 percent last month. Fuel oil rose 16.3 percent; gasoline, 10.6 percent, and natural gas, 3.4 percent. In good news, the department said food prices dropped 0.6 percent. Vegetables were down 16.1 percent; turkeys, 4.9 percent; pasta, 4.4 percent; and beef, 4.0 percent. Prices for pork, fish, fruit and rice also fell. Excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 0.7 percent in September following a 0.5 percent increase in August. The cost of home furnishings, health products, magazines, floor coverings, tobacco and alcoholic beverages all rose. In another economic report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales rose 0.5 percent in September, the seventh consecutive month without a decline. Overall sales increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 145.2 billion last month following a 0.7 percent gain in August and a revised 0.7 percent rise in July. The 0.9 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index left it at 113.5, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 113.50 last month. In advance, many economists were predicting a 0.7 percent or 0.8 percent rise. The return of wholesale inflation in September was likely to dampen financial market speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would soon lower interest rates. Traders had been hoping the central bank would cut rates to curb the rise in the value of the dollar, which is hurting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chances to improve its trade deficit. However, in a speech at a conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday night, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, `` We have to focus our attention in monetary policy on domestic inflationary implications.'' The inflation news was not particularly encouraging in September measures of prices earlier in the production process. Intermediate goods rose 0.4 percent after three successive drops and crude goods jumped 1.1 percent. Examples of the three processing stages _ finished, intermediate and crude _ are bread, flour and wheat. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in recent months has been walking a tightrope, hoping to keep interest rates high enough to dampen inflationary pressures but low enough to avoid a recession, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economic consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> fought inflationary pressures through this spring by driving short-term interest rates up. Then, after signs of economic softness emerged, the central bank eased a bit in June and July. But it has since held steady as a string of economic reports portrayed a resilient economy. Last week, in the first broad look at economic activity in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported manufacturing lost 103,000 jobs _ the biggest drop in seven years _ as the unemployment rate edged up from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent. Many analysts took the report as a sign of renewed weakness, possibly giving the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> room to lower interest rates further. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is still concerned that inflation is too high. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to say ` If there are signs of softness, that's too bad. Our first priority is to beat back inflation,''' he said.

<HEAD>Citrus Crop Estimates Down Due to Cold Snap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A cold snap that damaged tender orange and grapefruit blooms last winter may set back the citrus industry's recovery from tree-killing freezes in the mid 1980s, agriculture officials said State forecasters Thursday estimated <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will harvest 130 million boxes of oranges and 44 million boxes of grapefruit this season. It would be the smallest orange crop in three years and the smallest grapefruit crop in five years. The drop is attributed to a three-day dip in temperatures that hurt blooms last February but did not damage fruit on the trees. `` The good news is that the trees themselves were not damaged by the cold,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, citrus statistician with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. `` So if we get through this winter, we should have a good crop next year.'' During the season that ended in July, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> harvested 146.6 million boxes of oranges and 54.8 million boxes of grapefruit worth an estimated $ 1.41 billion. A record $ 1.44 billion citrus crop was harvested the previous season. The joint state and federal crop reporting service uses a combination of surveys and computer models to make the crop forecasts. Major freezes in 1983 and 1985 killed about 200,000 acres of trees, most in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` I personally thought it would be a few more boxes, but it's a good estimate on both oranges and grapefruit,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> citrus grower and processor. `` It's good for prices, particularly on grapefruit. Although smaller crops generally increase prices, a record orange crop in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> estimated at 300 million boxes could keep domestic juice prices down, officials said. More than 90 percent of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s orange crop is converted to juice. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, citrus specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the orange forecast was at least 20 million boxes smaller than he was anticipating. `` I would n't second-guess them,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION>. `` Based on their track record and their computer models, they're generally pretty accurate.'' The smaller orange crop means that the state should produce about 149.8 million gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice, down from 175 million gallons in 1988-1989, according to estimates by the Lakeland-based <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest growers' organization. `` If we escape this season with no serious freezes in the citrus belt, the 1990-91 crop should be the best we've had in many years,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McKown </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION>, a state agency that promotes the industry with money collected from grower fees, also may have to cut its $ 72.4 million budget as a result of the smaller crop, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>. `` We're a little disappointed in the crop sizes, but we have every confidence that the industry is still on the road to recovery from the earlier freezes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said. A box of oranges weighs 90 pounds, and a box of grapefruit is 85 pounds.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders today agreed on a plan to strip hundreds of special-interest provisions from a $ 14.1 billion deficit-reduction bill, leaving partisan fights over a capital gains tax cut and other controversial issues for the future. Republican and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders were attempting to sell the agreement to their respective members, which if successful would ease the way for completion of the budget-cutting bill later in the day. `` We think this is absolutely the best approach,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the deal would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to pass `` a stripped-down bill, I mean really stripped.'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the finance panel, said, `` This ensures we will have another tax bill very soon _ two or three weeks.'' He said a capital gains tax cut, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to expand Individual Retirement Accounts and other proposals could be attached to that tax measure. Across-the-board spending cuts on government programs totaling $ 16 billion will take effect Monday unless the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> finishes its deficit-reduction bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agree to a compromise version and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signs it into law. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> previously passed its own $ 11 billion deficit-cutting bill loaded with special-interest provisions of its own. With <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members out of town until next week, it seems unlikely that a compromise bill can be completed until then. If the automatic cuts take effect, they can be rolled back by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later. Earlier today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that while `` mixing capital gains and IRAs in this debate is troublesome to me,'' he would let Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> find the solution to a dispute that has slowed work on a $ 14.1 billion deficit-reduction bill. Asked if he was ruling out accepting broader IRAs, he said, `` I am not ruling out anything in that regard. I am ruling in capital gains.'' The leaders worked out the deal as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> headed into a second day of debate on the budget-cutting measure, which has drawn criticism from members of both parties for being loaded with provisions for special interests that do little to shrink the deficit. Republicans, with support from some Democrats, have been threatening to offer an amendment reducing the capital gains tax, a top priority of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told reporters Thursday `` without a doubt'' he would prevent the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> from getting the 60 votes it needs. `` We're going to offer it every chance we have,'' including putting it on the deficit-reduction bill, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., told reporters The budget-cutting legislation, aimed at whittling the deficit to below $ 110 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, took its share of abuse Thursday from lawmakers who said it was stocked with unnecessary items. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., whose panel sent the legislation to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Thursday on a 9-7 vote, said the 1,376-page measure would be only 100 pages long if extraneous provisions were removed from it Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., hefted the bill, which he said weighed 12 pounds, 15 ounces `` I do n't think there's a single senator who has more or less a general idea about what is in this legislation,'' he complained. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, cited some language he said had little to do with reducing the federal budget shortfall: `` strike ` eggplants' and substitute, ` eggplants, kiwi fruits, nectarines and plums,''' he read. The first amendment the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved Thursday boosted hospital spending by $ 40 million. The legislation would raise $ 5.3 billion in mostly minor new tax increases, including a doubling of the current $ 3 tax charged to departing international airline passengers and a new tax on chemicals that deplete the atmosphere's ozone. It also makes permanent the 3 percent tax on long-distance and local telephone service that otherwise would expire next year. The measure raises $ 50 million by requiring boat owners to purchase decals and $ 239 million by forcing airlines to pay for using airports in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. It would save $ 3.1 billion under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> by reducing payments to hospitals, freezing reimbursement rates for doctors and limiting increases in other medical costs. The bill takes credit for nearly $ 1.8 billion in savings merely by moving the money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> off-budget, and $ 420 million more by postponing some agriculture payments until a later fiscal year. Other provisions have little to do with eliminating budgetary red ink. Federal child care efforts are beefed up and a Commission on Child Disability is established.

 Share prices closed modestly lower Friday, pulled down by a report of higher inflation and a sharp drop on Wall Street. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, settled well off the day's high at 2,233.9, down 3.9 points or 0.17 percent. The index finished the week 1.9 percent off its week-earlier close of 2,277.5. Wall Street's sharp drop, reportedly on a wave of program selling, helped spark the retreat of buying interest, which dealers said was already shaken by a report of unexpectedly high British retail inflation. Retail prices were up 7.6 percent in September compared with a year ago, and vs. 7.3 percent in August, the government reported. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index ended 0.3 points higher at 1,818.0. Volume was 457.7 million shares traded, up slightly from Thursday's equally modest 437.4 million shares. The Financial Times 500 index closed at 1,240.40, down 1.57.

 Stock prices slumped again today as the market absorbed the news of a jump in the producer price index. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 23.16 points to 2,736.68 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 377 up, 1,040 down and 472 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly reversing a series of declines through the summer months. At first, the market took the news with little evident concern. Analysts noted that a rise of about that size had been widely expected in the financial world. Economists also said they believed that much of the increase stemmed from temporary influences that did n't necessarily portend more bad news on inflation in the months ahead. However, the figures still were taken as a message that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would n't be very likely to take any steps soon to relax its credit policy. That concern was reinforced by a separate report of an unexpectedly strong 0.5 percent gain in retail sales last month. <ORGANIZATION> Aristech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> climbed 4 -RRB- to 21 -RCB- in active trading. The company said it received a $ 25-a-share takeover proposal from a group including investor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntsman </PERSON>. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 at 43 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down -RCB- at 106 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, down | at 46 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 -RCB- at 127 -RCB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 1.65 to 195.33. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was off 1.66 at 393.35. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 117.46 million shares with two hours to go.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Friday to scrap what she called discriminatory, anti-competitive trade practices and said <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> must work with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to overcome <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frustration with the Japanese. `` Anti-competitive practices, whether official or private, run counter to the world we seek, and to the world that brought <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> its prosperity,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a strong feeling of inequality _ where the American market is open but markets overseas are closed, where the overseas investor buys stocks, bonds, businesses -LRB- in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB-, but Americans can not do so overseas,'' she said. `` We must work together to bring down that feeling of frustration.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Thursday for a four-day visit and met later with Construction Minister <PERSON> Shozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>. On Friday, Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> that she hopes for a `` quiet, friendly resolution'' to trade problems between the two countries, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. She told the Japanese leader she hoped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would implement by November measures to liberalize its construction market, and increase imports of American satellites, supercomputers and forestry products. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said he was working hard to get <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to import more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products and noted that Japanese imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year rose $ 10 billion over 1987, ministry officials said. In her speech Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for what she described as unfair business practices such as Japanese firms' alleged habit of buying only from Japanese suppliers, and discrimination against foreign investors. She said she was happy that a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and an American toy retailer to set up shop in this country was likely to be approved by the Japanese government within two years, but added, `` even two years is a long time compared to no wait at all when a foreign investor wishes to open a large store in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The tough-talking ex-attorney also criticized a practice called `` patent flooding'' in which certain firms apply for so many patents that competitors can not easily market rival products. Asked about a public opinion poll conducted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this month by the Gallup Organization that showed more Americans thought <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic strength was a greater threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than the Soviet military, Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said, `` I do n't see Japanese economic power as a threat. It's a wonderful accomplishment. But I see the destruction of the world trading system as a threat.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has expressed an interest in joining <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in a bid for the historic <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> film and TV studio. But <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON> declined comment Friday on whether <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, whose $ 1.5 billion merger collapsed Monday, were renegotiating the deal. However, a source close to the transaction, who asked not to be identified, said no formal talks had taken place and that if contacts had taken place, they were extremely tentative. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> had approached <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> with a proposal to become a participant in their bid for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> and `` we were interested.'' <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> would n't say how much <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had been asked to chip in, nor would he disclose plans to cope with federal rules that restrict the major networks' role in owning or distributing programming to local TV stations. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, has been a vocal opponent of the so-called financial interest and syndication rules, calling them an outmoded restriction on the networks. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> first bid for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> last spring in a complicated deal that would have resulted in it paying about $ 600 million for some assets. Three weeks ago, media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> stepped in with a last-minute, $ 1.4 billion bid for the entire company, but <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> topped that by bidding $ 25 a share, or $ 1.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s principal shareholder, <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, accepted and the deal was to have become final Dec. 15. But the agreement collapsed Monday after <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> charged <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> with failing to deliver a $ 50 million letter of credit, a nonrefundable down payment. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> has filed suit in federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> seeking at least $ 50 million in damages.

 A bearish crop report and forecasts for a weekend of good harvesting weather triggered a late plunge in soybean futures prices to new 23-month lows Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Grain futures closed mostly lower, following the soybean market down as the trading day ended. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s new crop estimates for corn and soybeans were higher than expected at 7.45 billion bushels and 1.93 billion bushels respectively in a report released after Thursday's close A higher-than-expected wheat-crop estimate of 2.04 billion bushels held traders' attention for most of the day, supporting the wheat futures and keeping the corn and soybean markets from falling. But when some of the big players started selling soybeans near the close, others rushed to join them and soybeans for November delivery fell rapidly below $ 5.50 a bushel to the market's lowest close since at least Nov. 11, 1987.

 Common Cause today asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the activities of five senators who intervened on behalf of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings institution after receiving large campaign contributions from its owner. At the same time, the group called on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the savings and loan association he heads violated federal election laws. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, eventually collapsed and was seized by the government in April. Analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers $ 2 billion to protect the institution's depositors. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled citizen's lobby, called for ethics committee investigations of five senators who met with regulators in April 1987 at the request of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent. The five are Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> today pledged their full cooperation <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, in letters to the ethics panel and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, added, `` I am fully confident that I engaged in no unethical conduct.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flander </PERSON>, said the senator met with regulators only to urge them to bring their lengthy examination of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to a conclusion, not to influence its outcome. The other senators' offices did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Common Cause, along with Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., requested the ethics investigation last year that eventually led to the downfall of former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was also accused of intervening with regulators on <ORGANIZATION> behalf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners, but <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said, `` I think we have a different case, different circumstances.'' After three years of examinations and audits, regulators seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on April 14. Last month, they filed a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit charging <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his family and associates with fraud and racketeering. Among the allegations are that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> diverted money from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to fund his personal, political and charitable convictions. All five senators received campaign contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, returned his a year later and <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> last month. <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> should appoint a special counsel to determine whether the intervention violated the Code of <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that prohibits members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from accepting `` favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.'' In a letter today, he asked <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section, to determine whether <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s contribution to the senators violated federal election laws or other statutes. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in preparation for four public hearings on the case, voted Thursday to subpoena <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. `` We already know that in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> we have on our hands a case that will cost the savings an loan insurance fund at least $ 2 billion,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking panel chairman Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This committee ... is required to determine what went wrong within the regulatory agencies.'' Also subpoenaed Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel were <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan commissioner, and other officials.

 Stock prices took a sudden nosedive late today, driving the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average down to a loss of 100 points with less than an hour to go before the closing bell. At 2 p.m. EDT, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> was off just 23 points, but in an hour the average had plunged 115 points amid news that a labor-management group failed to secure financing for its buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 353 up, 1,138 down and 429 unchanged. The market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most of the session until the group planning to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> said it had run into trouble arranging financing. That quickly cast a pall over shares of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and other companies that have been involved in or are planning debt-financed deals. Brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the market for high-yielding `` junk'' bonds. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly reversing a series of declines through the summer months. The figures were taken as a message that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would n't be very likely to take any steps soon to relax its credit policy. That concern was reinforced by a separate report of an unexpectedly strong 0.5 percent gain in retail sales last month. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 3.78 to 193.26. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was off 2.78 at 392.23. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 143 million shares with an hour to go.

 Stock prices plunged in a dramatic late selloff today as news of a failed takeover deal rocked an already slumping market. Shortly before the close, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down about 180 points, having tumbled below the 2,600 level. The market began its precipitous slide after a labor-management group planning to acquire <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it could n't get the bank financing it needed. That came as a fresh blow to traders who had already grown increasingly worried about strains in the market for debt-financed takeovers and buyouts.

Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., has received $ 5,000 and the panel's ranking Republican, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, has received $ 350 The two, along with Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ranking Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore., are sponsors of airline takeover legislation moving quickly through the House that would benefit <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> have also received <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> PAC contributions this year. The PAC has given members of the full committee a total of $ 22,350 in the first six months of the year. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, recently elected to fill the seat vacated by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, is seeking an assignment to the panel. He has received $ 10,000. Five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have also received $ 8,000 this year from the PAC. The panel has already approved legislation similar to the measure in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. A PAC, separate from the corporation, is funded by voluntary contributions from company officers, directors, managers and shareholders. Spokesmen for the airline did not immediately return phone calls Friday to answer questions on the subject. The House bill introduced Wednesday would give the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> up to 50 days to review any acquisition of 15 percent or more of the stock of a major air carrier's voting stock. The bill would cover <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which the company is resisting, and the proposed purchase of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, approved in committee last week, sets the acquisition threshhold at 25 percent of an airline's stock and gives <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> 90 days to block a takeover. An amendment is being drafted that would make the bill retroactive to Oct. 1, to cover AMR and possibly <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote after it completes work on legislation to reduce the budget deficit, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee has scheduled a hearing, followed by a vote, on Monday, with the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expected to act Tuesday. Sponsors of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill had sought a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> vote on their legislation the day after its introduction, but agreed to allow a hearing in the aviation subcommittee after several Republicans objected to such a fast-track approach. `` This is not a knee-jerk reaction strictly to the American bid,'' <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Berard </PERSON> said about the House bill. But <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> is moving quickly because of the American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> takeover attempts, <PERSON> Berard </PERSON> said. American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> are the largest carriers in the country in an industry dominated by just a half-dozen airlines, and <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> wants to be sure passenger safety is not compromised by a buyer's heavy debt, <PERSON> Berard </PERSON> said `` The airlines know he's honest, know where he's coming from,'' <PERSON> Berard </PERSON> said. `` He'll be fair with the airlines, he's not going to bash them unnecessarily. When public safety is in question he'll ask the tough questions. <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> also received $ 3,300 from the PAC in 1987-88. According to <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> records, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and 1988 contributed to the campaigns of all but two members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, and all but about a dozen of the full transportation committee.

 Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks for the first 10 days of the 1990 model year tumbled 12.2 percent compared with the same period last year, mainly because of declines in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sales, the companies reported Friday. For Oct. 1-10, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> car sales were off 24.2 percent and its truck sales were off 28.7 percent from early October of 1988. The eight U.S.-based manufacturers said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 30,626, compared with a rate of 34,867 during the same time last year. Car sales for all makers were down 13.1 percent in early October while truck sales were off 10.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s early-October car and truck sales were down 0.3 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s sales were off 2.3 percent. There had been speculation that fourth-quarter sales this year would be significantly softer than during the third quarter. In early October last year, sales were relatively soft compared with earlier periods and with what proved to be the average annual sales rate. Part of the reason for predictions of a soft fourth quarter was the expectation that consumers would flock to showrooms to pick up 1989 models to beat the price 990 models. It was difficult to determine Friday whether that was a factor in the decline in sales. There still are 1989 models for sale, some with attractive rebates and low-interest financing deals. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced the average price for its 1990 cars would be 5 percent more than for 1989 versions. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> announced an average increase of 4.9 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its 1990 prices would be 3.4 percent higher. For the calendar year so far, domestic cars and trucks are selling at an average daily rate of 38,236, compared with a rate of 38,773 through Oct. 10 last year, a decline of 1.4 percent. Car sales for the year are running 2.5 percent behind last year's pace while truck sales are 0.6 percent ahead.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said its 1990 cars would cost an average of 5 percent more than in 1989. It was the same increase as <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-introduction prices announced earlier and the largest price increase among the Big Three. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced a 4.9 percent increase and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> an increase of 3.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, said about half the price increase was due to government requirements for air bags or automatic seat belts for front-seat passengers. All of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> built cars are equipped with driver's - side air bags as <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said air bags accounted for 3 percentage points in the increase. `` This modest increase reflects our intention to be price competitive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Overall Banking Health Masks Problems In Northeast, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The banking industry's overall profitably is masking weakness in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where real estate loans are causing increasing problems, industry analyst <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said Friday. `` Real estate is often the industry's Achilles' heel,'' he said. <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> singled out <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as trouble spots. `` I do n't think that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is about to become known as ` <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,''' he said, `` but you're starting to see a replay of what happened in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in some markets in the Northeast.'' Banking problems have been centered in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, where failures have set records each of the last two years. <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said the worst has passed in that region. `` The level of non-performing loans and the return to profitability indicate that this region is beginning to bottom out,'' <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said. `` We anticipate that the regional economy and its banks will be climbing back, but not bouncing back.'' During the first half of the year, three states reported overall losses: <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, $ 132.3 million; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 98.7 million; and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, $ 31.5 million.'' Nationally, earnings were $ 14.1 billion, with 90 percent of the nation's banks making a profit, <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said. But those earnings `` do not reflect some underlying problems, particularly in Northeastern states,'' he said. `` Particularly worrisome is the fact that real estate loans have constituted the fastest growing segment of bank lending not only in this quarter, but for the past five years,'' <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, some of this real estate lending financed speculative excesses which will take time to be absorbed, often at significantly reduced prices with resulting loan losses.'' Just Thursday, two large <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks reported combined losses of $ 1.1 billion in the third quarter. A large portion of the losses came from increased reserves for loans to Third World nations. Included in those losses was $ 300 million set aside by <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to cover possible losses on non-performing loans _ those three months past due _ at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` In every major bank on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, there is now somebody taking a much harder look at their real estate loans and seeing if they need to increase their reserves,'' said <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said 57.7 percent of all non-performing loans in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> were on real estate, 46 percent in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and 15.4 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Overall, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had the largest amount of non-performing loans at $ 22.2 billion, reflecting the large concentration of loans to Third World banks in the money center banks. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> had the largest increase during the first half of the year, as non-performing loans increased 61.3 percent, followed by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> at 56.5 percent and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> at 44.3 percent. `` We're just starting to see some of the effects of the speculative excesses that have occurred in those regional real estate markets,'' <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said by telephone from his <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> office. `` In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, it's the aftermath; in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, it's been really building for the last five years.''

 If you're looking skyward to see whether <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s name on it yet or <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> owns part of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, you may miss those Saab-Fords, GM-Jaguars or Renault-Volvos barreling down the road. Like their transportation counterparts in the air, the automakers of the world are reaching out to each other to form strategic relationships that reflect increasingly brutal competition on the ground. These alliances are coming against a backdrop of trouble in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market, by far the most lucrative for any major automaker. There are signs that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> all could report third-quarter losses on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> automotive operations because of slow sales and costly incentives aimed at luring buyers. If so, it would be the worst showing by the Big Three since the 1982 recession. Problems in the American market have spilled over to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where several major automakers are struggling because they are n't selling as many cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Aggravating matters for them is the impending relaxation of trade barriers in the 12-nation Common Market in 1992. This will make it much easier, for example, to buy a <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or a Rover in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. That means the makers of those cars face more competition from their neighbors. Moreover, competition from the aggressive Japanese is hurting both American and European carmakers. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> already have well-established assembly operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a response to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s efforts years ago to restrict foreign imports <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> said this past week it plans to double vehicle-building capacity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within the next five years. Toyota and other Japanese carmakers are now moving quickly to establish plants in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before 1992. These developments have forced many automakers to reassess their ability to sell vehicles all over the world. For the weaker competitors, that has meant forging alliances with stronger rivals or each other. This past week, <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> disclosed they have begun talks aimed at exploring a possible merger or collaboration in truck or car manufucturing. Both companies have been finding it increasingly difficult to sell cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Earlier in the week, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said it was mulling whether to sell a minority stake to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and was discussing possible joint manufacturing and marketing ventures with the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s move was partly a defensive response to unwelcome overtures by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which had earlier expressed interest in buying all or part of the luxury carmaker and had received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust clearance to purchase up to 15 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also has expressed interest in buying all or part of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish carmaker that has been suffering weak sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but has significant truckmaking operations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In other business and economic news this past week: _ Signs of higher inflation and the collapse of a big buyout for airline giant <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sent the stock market plummeting in the worst day since the Oct. 19, 1987 collapse almost exactly two years earlier _ <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> scrapped its agreement to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.5 billion because of financing problems The collapse of that deal opened the way for resumption of takeover talks with other possible interested buyers of one of the largest American entertainment concerns. _ Despite little or no movement to resolve a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the aerospace giant received an order potentially worth $ 5 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> The order was considered a blow to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s European rival <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, which had hoped for a longstanding relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> after securing a $ 3.2 billion order from the carrier three years ago.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> is interested in buying <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, Kan.-based <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>, a move that would link <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s flights with routes flown by its recently acquired Milwaukee-based subsidiary. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Risley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s vice president for corporate affairs, said Friday that <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> sent a letter Oct. 12 to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>, `` and requested the opportunity to enter into an exclusive agreement with him leading to 100 percent acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> stock.'' <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s negotiating suggestion of $ 6.34 per share of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> stock, based on the market price at the time the letter was sent, calculates to slightly more than $ 24 million. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>'s over-the-counter stock dipped from $ 8.38 a share on June 30 to $ 4.75 a share on Thursday. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s over-the-counter stock closed at $ 7.75 a share on Thursday. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON>, who owns more than 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> stock, or about 509,000 shares, sent a letter Friday to <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> saying <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> is considering a variety of alternatives and is willing to meet. Air Midwest has 42 airplanes and serves 39 cities in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Air Midwest was hit hard by the recent bankruptcy reorganization of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The smaller carrier provided connector flights to <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s hub in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and about one-half its revenues were from ties with <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>. During the second quarter this year, the latest period for which figures are available, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.6 million, nearly four times the earnings for the same quarter in 1988. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has 16 airplanes serving 25 cities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Skyway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>, has six airplanes serving 15 cities in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> acquired Skyway in April. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> on Aug. 4 reported net income of $ 101,546, or 6 cents a share, on revenue of more than $ 5.8 million for its third fiscal quarter that ended June 30. <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> said acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> would give <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> flights that travel from the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> earlier this week rejected a merger proposed by a smaller carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Stateswest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>'s board rejected <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 31 million buyout offer of $ 8 a share on June 29.

 A plunge in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> car and light truck sales led an 11.9 percent decline in early-October vehicle sales by domestic automakers compared with last year, the companies said Friday. It was the first sales period of the 1990 model year and the first in what analysts have said would be a soft three-month period. The eight major companies making vehicles in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said their cars and light trucks sold at an average rate of 30,734 a day during the Oct. 1-10 period this year, compared with 34,867 during the same time last year. The decline was led by a 24.2 percent fall in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales and a 28.7 percent decline in the company's truck sales. Overall, the industry leader's car and truck sales were off 25.6 percent for the period. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s total vehicle sales were down 0.3 percent in early October and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s were off 2.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s sales dive may have been spurred by its program of rewarding dealers who cleared out stocks of 1989 vehicles before Sept. 30, the end of the 1989 model year. `` We had a strong, strong, strong month of September and also I think there is a lull here in some of the buying,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` One can not judge a year on 10 days.'' For the year to date, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 6.2 percent while truck sales were up 2.4 percent. At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, year-to-date car sales were up 0.1 percent and truck sales were down 2 percent, while at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, car sales were off 11.1 percent and truck sales were up 0.2 percent. For months, as word of 1990 model price increases spread, analysts and others have been saying sales in the fourth quarter of this year would be considerably softer than during the third quarter, when incentives helped. That `` payback'' may be coming true, said analyst <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sixty to 75 percent -LRB- of the early October sales -RRB- should have been'90s,'' he said. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he wanted to see how sales go later in the month before saying whether the payback was under way. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its cars sold at an average daily rate of 8,538 during the early October period this year, compared with a rate of 11,273 during the same period last year. Its early-October truck sales were reported at an average daily rate of 3,654 compared with a rate of 5,126 last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it sold an average of 7,169 cars a day during the period this year, compared with 7,301 during the same time last year, for a 1.8 percent decline. Truck sales, meantime, rose to an average daily rate of 4,299 for the period this year, up 2.4 percent from the 4,197 truck-a-day rate in early October last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were off 7.5 percent in early October, falling to a daily average of 2,840 this year compared with a rate of 3,071 last year. Truck sales at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> were up 4.3 percent, rising to a daily rate of 2,515 during the period this year, compared with 2,412 last year.

 The stock market's sudden drop Friday afternoon sent financial workers out onto Wall Street in a daze, assessing the damage and already worrying about next week. `` It's not fun, it's not fun,'' mumbled a middle-aged man in a trench coat as he emerged from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the final bell. `` People were taking a little bit of a beating in there.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 190.58 points to 2,569.26 _ its second biggest point drop ever, exceeded only by the 508-point loss recorded on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. The man in the trench coat, who would not give his name, predicted more of the same following the weekend: `` I think they're gon na run on Monday. Memories of 1987 dominated conversation. `` I thought it was all over two years ago,'' said a stock exchange floor reporter named <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>. `` But I never thought it would happen again. I figured only on Friday the 13th would this happen.'' Another man on a street corner shook his head and said to a friend, `` I'm trying to figure out whether I got my head handed to me. I just do n't know.'' But stockbroker <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was defiantly optimistic: `` This is not going to be like Black Monday. The market is going to stick on Monday, absolutely. What we had today was just panic selling.'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Schure </PERSON>, an options trader, was n't so sure. `` This just shows that the upward movement was n't on stable ground,'' Schure said. `` Most people took hit today. One guy I know went down for $ 150,000.'' Said options trader <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>: `` Monday's going to be a scary day. People have all weekend to think about this. It was grim.''

 The biggest wave of selling since the crash of 1987 swept through the stock market today, sending prices plunging on the news that a big buyout deal for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had fallen through. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials nosedived 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26. That marked its second biggest point drop ever, exceeded only by the 508-point loss recorded on Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987. Just four days ago the average hit a record closing high of 2,791.41. The market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most of the session until the group planning to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> said it had been unable to get enough bank financing for the transaction it had planned. That quickly cast a pall over shares of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and other companies that have been involved in or are planning debt-financed deals. Brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the market for high-yielding `` junk'' bonds. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly reversing a series of declines through the summer months. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> news `` was the trigger for the whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Also, it's October,'' <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON> added. `` Memories of 1987 are still very vivid.'' Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> totaled 251.17 million shares, up from 160.12 million in the previous session and the heaviest total since 254.87 million were traded on Jan. 27. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index tumbled 11.43 to 185.55. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 16.56 at 378.45.

 Currency dealers pounded down the dollar Friday in hectic selling incited by the worst stock plunge since the crash two years ago. Harried traders reported an atmosphere of alarm suddenly engulfed the currency markets late in the afternoon as stock prices skidded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` It just seemed everybody wanted to sell dollars. It was just a mass panic,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Palladino </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The intensity of the stock market selloff was especially unnerving because it occurred almost two years to the day after the worst Wall Street crash ever. `` There was an eerie sense of deja vu,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>, manager of treasury operations at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The dollar reacted to it pretty violently.'' The widely watched <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 190.58 points to 2,569.26, the largest drop since the crash on Oct. 19, 1987. Other stock indices also fell sharply. Dollar sales bred additional selling as the dollar sank below thresholds that professional traders had designated as `` stop loss'' levels. In stop-loss maneuvers, traders sell to guard against possibly losing more money in case a market slide continues. The drop in the dollar was exaggerated by the diminished trading volume that is typical for Friday afternoons. On Fridays, banks stop dealing directly with one another earlier than on other days of the week, which reduces liquidity in the market. Price movements have a greater impact when liquidity is low. Dealers said they expected the dollar to lose additional ground against other major currencies in Asian trading over the weekend. Initially on Friday, two economic reports had encouraged some dollar buying. A 0.9 percent surge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Producer Price Index during September and a rise of 0.5 percent in retail sales indicated that interest rates would not decline anytime soon. The early enthusiasm for dollars was dampened somewhat, however, by unconfirmed reports that central banks had sold dollars to keep the currency in check. By the time trading was done for the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar stood at 142.05 yen, down from 144.15 yen on Thursday. The loss of about 2 yen was unusually large. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 144.00 Japanese yen from 144.60 yen at Thursday's close and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it edged up to 144.10 yen. The British pound benefited from the dollar's decline. A pound fetched $ 1.5820 late in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. $ 1.5527 Thursday. In earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealings, the pound rose to $ 1.5625 from $ 1.5520 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8720 West German marks, down from 1.9075; 1.6420 Swiss francs, down from 1.6735; 6.34375 French francs, down from 6.4670; 1,376.00 Italian lire, down from 1,399.25; and, 1.17385 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1749 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.9025 West German marks, down from 1.9068; 1.6720 Swiss francs, up from 1.6715; 6.4562 French francs, down from 6.4650; 2.1465 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1510; 1,396.50 Italian lire, down from 1,397.50; and, 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1737 Gold prices registered little reaction to the slump in stocks and the dollar. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 363.30 a troy ounce, 10 cents lower than Thursday's settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 364.80 an ounce, compared with Thursday's late bid of $ 363 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal rose to a late bid price of $ 364.25 a troy ounce from $ 362.75 bid late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to a bid of $ 363.70 from $ 363.10 late Thursday. Gold in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> rose 49 cents to a close of $ 363.69 from $ 363.20 at Thursday's close. Silver bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a bid of $ 5.12 a troy ounce, up from late Thursday's bid of $ 5.10. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $ 5.079 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.090 on Thursday.

Among other refined petroleum products traded on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION>, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline went up 0.58 cent to 56.15 cents a gallon, more than making up for Thursday's drop of 0.16 cent. Contracts for later delivery also settled higher. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, added 42 cents to settle at $ 20.89 per 42-gallon barrel after rising 22 cents on Thursday. Contracts calling for delivery December through February sported more modest gains.

 A sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a rebound in wholesale price inflation in September, wiping out three rare monthly declines this summer, the government said Friday. The 0.9 percent increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index, measuring inflation one stop short of the retail level, represented a return to the high inflation rates experienced in the first five months of the year. Analysts were not overly concerned, however. They noted that nearly all of the gain in the index can be attributed to two special factors: an unusually large and probably one-time rise in oil costs and a shift in seasonal patterns that made a modest drop in auto prices look like a large increase. `` If you take out the seasonals for autos and the energy blip, which I think is just a rebound from -LRB- declines -RRB- we had this summer, it suggests inflation's just not that bad,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, stock prices fell in early trading after the data was interpreted as an indication the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will not lower interest rates soon. `` These figures are appropriate for Friday the 13th and seem destined to strike terror into the hearts of financial markets,'' said economist <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. The market also was reacting to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing a stronger-than-expected 0.5 percent increase in retail sales last month, the seventh consecutive rise. Later in the day, the market fell sharply on news that a labor-management group had failed to secure financing for a proposed $ 6.75 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled 190.58 points to 2,569.26, the steepest drop since the 1987 crash. In a balancing act, the central bank is trying to keep interest rates high enough to control inflationary pressures but low enough to avoid a recession. The gain in retail sales indicated some bouyancy in the economy, dashing traders' hope for <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> easing. Those hopes had been kindled last week by a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing manufacturers lost 103,000 jobs in September. The Business Council, composed of 100 top business leaders gathering for a conference in the resort town of <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, predicted Friday that the economy will continue to soften in 1990 and may even topple into a recession unless the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> cuts interest rates. The climb last month in wholesale prices wiped out consecutive declines of 0.4 percent in August and July and 0.1 percent in June. That brought the annual wholesale inflation rate for the first nine months of the year to 5.1 percent, compared with 4.0 percent in all of 1988. Contributing to the big September jump was a fluke in the measurement of auto prices, which were skewed because manufacturers offered their end-of-the-model-year price incentives earlier in the summer than usual. When month-to-month increases were adjusted for normal seasonal variations, auto prices rose 3.8 percent in September. When seasonal adjustments are factored out, auto prices actually declined 0.5 percent. Energy prices, which had fallen in June, July and August, shot up 6.5 percent last month. Fuel oil prices rose 16.3 percent; gasoline, 10.6 percent, and natural gas, 3.4 percent. `` That's an exceptionally high increase, which will not be repeated, but that does n't mean energy prices are coming down,'' said economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In good news, the department said food prices dropped 0.6 percent following a 0.3 percent gain a month earlier. Vegetable prices were down 16.1 percent; turkeys, 4.9 percent; pasta, 4.4 percent, and beef, 4.0 percent. Prices for pork, fish, fruit and rice also fell. Excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 0.7 percent in September following a 0.5 percent increase in August. The cost of home furnishings, health products, magazines, floor coverings, tobacco and alcoholic beverages all rose last month. The 0.9 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index for finished goods left it at 113.5, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 113.50 last month. Two measures of prices earlier in the production process also rose. Intermediate goods increased 0.4 percent after three successive drops and crude goods jumped 1.1 percent, partly offsetting a 1.0 percent decline in August. Examples of the three processing stages _ finished, intermediate and crude _ are bread, flour and wheat.

 The lobbying group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Friday to investigate the intervention of five senators in the regulation of what's expected to become the nation's costliest S & amp; L collapse. Common Cause, along with Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., requested the ethics investigation last year that eventually led to the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., violated ethics rules when they met with regulators in April 1987 concerning <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. All five had received substantial campaign contributions from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> At the same time, the group called on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> violated federal election laws in their efforts to influence the senators. `` The joint intervention ... into a case involving alleged violations by a specific company ... appears to be an extraordinary action,'' <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, which is insolvent, was seized by federal regulators on April 14 after more than two years of audits and examinations. Analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers $ 2 billion to protect the institution's depositors. Last month, the government filed a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit charging <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his family and associates with fraud and racketeering. Among the allegations are that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> diverted money from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to fund his personal, political and charitable convictions. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickwit </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s company, defended the millionaire's right to contribute to and seek help from the senators. `` Mr. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and the organizations he's been in association with had every right to make these contributions, which were within the limits of the law. He also has the right to seek the support of his representatives on matters of importance to him and he ought not to be more restricted in that regard than others who have not contributed,'' <PERSON> Bickwit </PERSON> said, reading a prepared statement. According to Common Cause, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> contributed $ 850,000 to three private organizations founded or controlled by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and $ 47,000 to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s campaigns; $ 200,000 to a political committee controlled by <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> as well as a $ 34,000 campaign contribution; campaign contributions of $ 112,000 and free jet flights valued at $ 13,433 to <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and his family; $ 76,100 to <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s campaign and $ 55,000 to <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s election effort. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> returned the contribution in March 1988, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> last month. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> reimbursed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for the jet flights but has not given back the $ 112,000. The five senators all issued statements pledging their cooperation with any probe. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, in letters to the ethics panel and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, added, `` I am fully confident that I engaged in no unethical conduct.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he met with regulators to urge them to bring their lengthy examination of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to a conclusion, not to influence its outcome. `` I did not violate any ethics rules or standards,'' he said. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said he attended the meeting only at the request of <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and said his conduct was `` entirely proper.'' <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> should appoint a special counsel to determine whether the intervention violated the Code of <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that prohibits members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from accepting `` favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.'' In a letter, he asked <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section, to determine whether <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s contribution to the senators violated federal election laws or other statutes. In the case against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the former speaker also was accused of intervening with regulators on <ORGANIZATION> behalf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners. But <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said, `` I think we have a different case, different circumstances.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in preparation for four public hearings on the case beginning next week, voted Thursday to subpoena <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and regulators who oversaw his institution. The hearings are expected to focus on why <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, as the nation's top <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator, delayed action from mid-1987 until April on a recommendation from field examiners that the government take control of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Stock-Index Futures Plummet; Orange Juice Futures Plunge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Tumbling stock prices triggered temporary trading halts for stock-index futures Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, in a drop that mirrored a near-record selloff on Wall Street. In other markets, orange juice futures plunged on word that Brazilian producers planned to cut their export price; crude oil futures jumped higher; soybean futures slumped while grain futures were mixed; livestock and meat futures advanced; and precious metals inched lower. The first 30-minute index futures trading halt came about 2 p.m. CDT after the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index fell 12 points from Thursday's close to 346.85. A 12-point drop in the index corresponds to a 100-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. When trading resumed, the market soon plunged to 328.85, 30 points below Thursday's close, triggering a second 30-minute pause in trading below that price at about 2:45 p.m., traders said. The second halt extended through the market's 3:15 p.m. closing. The so-called `` circuit breaker'' trading halts program was enacted after the 1987 stock market crash to provide a series of coordinated market breaks aimed at discouraging panic selling. Trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> also would have been temporarily halted once the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrials fell 250 points. That average finished down 190.58 at 2,569.26, the second worst daily drop after the 508-point decline in the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a stock-index trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the futures market plunged on news that a group seeking to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had been unable to obtain financing, which triggered new doubts about the market for high-yielding, high-risk junk bonds. Institutional investors use stock-index futures to hedge against losses in the stock market, sometimes employing computer-driven program trading strategies that can cause wild swings in prices on both markets. In orange juice, futures prices tumbled on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid talk that Brazilian producers planned to cut their export price from $ 1.60 to about $ 1.37 a pound. Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 1.5 cents to 4.95 cents lower with the contract for delivery in November at $ 1.321 a pound. The unconfirmed reports of a Brazilian price cut followed an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Thursday estimating the 1989-90 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop at 130 million boxes compared to 146.6 million boxes harvested in the crop year that ended in July. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest processor of frozen concentrated orange juice, is expected to produce at least 255 million boxes of oranges this year, up from 195 million last year. Industry analysts had been expecting the Brazilians to drop their prices in an effort to move more of their product onto the world market, said <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgakis </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Rumors that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> planned to cut their crude-oil production sent crude futures surging to near $ 21 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> before profit-taking trimmed the gains. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 42 cents higher with November at $ 20.89 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent lower to .10 cent higher with November at 60.87 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .58 cent to .85 cent higher with November at 56.15 cents a gallon. A bearish crop report and forecasts for a weekend of good harvesting weather triggered a late plunge in soybean futures prices to new 23-month lows Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Grain futures closed mostly lower. Soybeans settled 3 cents to 9 \ cents lower with November at $ 5.44 \ a bushel, the market's lowest close since Nov. 6, 1987; wheat futures were 5 cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 4.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were 1 -RCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.34 a bushel; oats were \ cent to -RCB- cent lower with December at $ 1.40 \ Frozen pork belly futures rallied strongly for the third straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by higher cash markets and buying linked to a plan to donate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork bellies to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Hog and cattle futures ended mostly higher on strong cash markets. Live cattle futures settled .20 cent to .50 cent higher with October at 73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .33 cent higher with October at 83.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at 48.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .57 cent to 1.48 cent higher with February at 51.20 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures edged lower in listless trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold futures settled 10 cents lower across the board with October at $ 363.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.1 cents to 1.3 cents lower with December at $ 5.14 a troy ounce.

 Banking regulators Friday ordered financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to cease dividend payments to shareholders and halt any stock repurchases. The decision by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> angered the chairman of the Miami-based institution who said a proposed $ 150 million sale of nearly all its branches would restore financial stability. `` We regret the issuance of the directive, which came as a total surprise to us,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer at <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>, which grew since 1983 into the largest thrift in the Southeast. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> is seeking federal approval to sell 63 of its 71 branches _ and all the accounts in the branches _ to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The branches have more than $ 2.4 billion in deposits. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> would be left with eight <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> branches holding about $ 800 million in deposits. `` If the regulators would approve the transaction, they would allow us to solve our problems and, we would hope, continue to pay our dividends,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in a news release. `` We will use our best efforts to try to convince our regulators that the suspension of dividends is not in their best interest or those of the institution. We hope they will reverse their decision.'' <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> has two classes of preferred stock, both of which were affected by the dividend ruling. Both stocks closed down $ 3.50 to $ 4.75 on over-the-counter trading Friday. With losses of about $ 16 million for the first half of this year, <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> has come under pressure from regulators to improve performance and streamline operations. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> has shrunk from more than $ 10 billion in assets to about $ 9 billion in recent months. The institution also has been criticized for a host of high-risk or unusual investments. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who took over the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, was ordered by regulators to sell a collection of paintings purchased with <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> funds.

She will be in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Nov. 10-11, the same time as President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said he did n't know whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would attend the <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> events with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.

To meet the company's orders, factories will have to `` beef up production,'' resulting in a `` direct infusion of dollars'' and an anticipated increase in labor. `` Most of the products -LRB- being ordered -RRB- would actually benefit the low income groups, because they are the ones that engage in the manufacturing activities,'' he said. <PERSON> Paglinawan </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s visit is `` consistent with her desire to really promote the expansion of trade and investments with the Americans.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, vice chairman and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> stores and catalogue, said in announcing the promotion that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has a tradition of quality and fine craftmanship had has been a growing apparel and home-furnishings source for the company for several years.

<HEAD>Junk Bonds Plunge As Fears Widen Over Possible Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Junk bond prices plunged Friday as financing problems for a major airline buyout widened fears over a possible collapse of the slumping $ 200 billion market of the high-yield securities. News that bidders had failed to raise financing for the planned $ 6.75 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, also spread panic that billions of dollars in other planned debt-financed deals would have to be scrapped. `` No one thinks this is the bottom,'' said a high-yield bond trader at a major Wall Street firm who asked not to be named. The decline Friday came in what already has been the worst shakeout ever in the junk bond market, which boomed in the 1980s on a wave of highly leveraged takeovers financed by the high-risk securities. The junk bond market decline began in September when <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had to get a $ 250 million loan to meet its junk bond obligations. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> scrapped a $ 475 million issue and <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> postponed indefinitely a $ 400 million issue. Prices of junk bonds _ so named because of their low credit ratings _ dropped for the 17th straight day Friday. Traders said the afternoon plunge was triggered by the 190-point drop on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s Dow Jones industrials average, the worst this year, which had been sparked by news of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> financing failure. Junk bond issues were down on average about 1 -LCB- points to 2 points, or as much as $ 20 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bonds, considered a `` quality'' issue, plummeted 3 points. <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bonds plunged 2 points. Western Union bonds droppped a whopping 15 points, in part because of reports of a possible bankruptcy filing. Quantum Chemicals, considered a less attractive issue, fell from 5 points to 7 points, traders said. `` There's an eerie silence in the junk bond market. There's no trading taking place,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a major credit rating agency. `` We face the problem of an eventual selloff where a number of junk bond holders will just want to get out and assume significant losses in the process,'' he said. Gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult, because most trading takes place over-the-counter _ that is, between dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond _ instead of in bidding on an open exchange. That same characteristic also can heighten big selloffs by making it more difficult to find buyers when the market is weak or falling. Very few junk bonds are listed on the American and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> exchanges and tallies on overall market volume are not available daily. Failure of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> deal heightened fears because while part of the financing was expected to come from junk bonds, traditional bank financing was to play a major role. `` If banks backed off that it's not a good sign for the rest of the market,'' <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> said. About $ 11 billion in new junk bond offerings from companies including <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Blockbuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; North Western railroad are scheduled to occur by the end of the year.

 Executives of the country's largest corporations were generally at a loss to explain Friday's huge drop in the stock market although some suggested that it could be a good thing if it cools speculative fever. The market plunge was an unwelcome intrusion on the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the chief executive officers of the nation's 100 largest corporations. Many of them learned of the sudden plunge while out on the golf course at the posh mountain resort where the conference is held. Executives swapped details of how their own stock had faired, but few were willing to give snap judgements about what went wrong. They said they had heard only sketchy details about the overall decline. They also were not willing to forecast what direction the market might take when it reopens on Monday. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said that he did not buy the explanation, offered widely on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, that the market drop was fueled entirely by the failure of the buyout deal for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that there has to be something more fundamental that caused the crash,'' he said. Asked if he was concerned about the huge sell-off, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Anytime you have the market drop by 197 points, if you are n't concerned, there's something wrong with you.'' The drop in the Dow Jones average was actually 190.58 at the close of trading. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market plunge could turn out to be a good thing if it `` leads to a flight to quality'' stocks and away from heavy speculation about takeover possibilities. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, noted Friday's decline was `` nowhere near as violent'' as the 508-point drop which occurred on Oct. 19, 1987. But <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said he was concerned that the rash of company takeovers had left many corporations so deeply in debt that they could be in serious trouble the next time interest rates increase.

 Stock-index futures trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was halted twice Friday as tumbling stock prices triggered `` circuit breakers'' designed to prevent a rapid, computer-driven collapse. It was the first time the market had fallen far enough to trigger 30-minute halts in trading since the circuit breakers were installed a year after the stock market's October 1987 collapse. The program was enacted to provide a series of market breaks in hopes that pauses in trading would discourage panic selling. But some critics of the program argued that the circuit breakers could have the opposite effect, contributing to a frenzied rush to sell. The first 30-minute halt occurred about 2 p.m. CDT after the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index had fallen 12 points from Thursday's close to 346.85 A 12-point drop in the index corresponds to a 100-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. At that point, traders were not allowed to execute any more sell orders at lower prices until trading resumed at 2:30 p.m. CDT. When trading resumed, the market traded back and forth for about 10 minutes, then plunged to 328.85, 30 points below Thursday's close, triggering a second 30-minute pause in trading below that price at about 2:45 p.m., traders said The second trading halt extended through the market's 3:15 p.m. closing time. A less-dramatic circuit breaker was triggered on March 17, when the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 futures opened with a 5-point loss, triggering a 10-minute halt to selling followed by a two-minute halt to all trading, said <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Poliski </PERSON>. On that day, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 48 points. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a stock-index trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the market plunged on news that a group seeking to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had been unable to obtain financing, which triggered new doubts about the market for high-yielding, high-risk junk bonds. Institutional investors use stock-index futures to hedge against losses in the stock market, sometimes employing computer-driven program trading strategies that can cause wild swings in prices on both markets. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said he sympathized with program traders who tried to cut their losses when the Dow started sliding toward what would become a loss of nearly 191 points on the day. `` From the program trading end I ca n't blame those guys,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. `` At one point I do n't think they could tell where the markets were.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest market for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 futures, installed the trading limits last year as part of a coordinated effort with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to prevent another market collapse like the 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average that occurred on Oct. 19, 1987. Under the coordinated program between the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, the next trigger point would have come had the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fallen 250 points from Thursday's close. The Dow never dipped that low on Friday, but if it had the procedures called for a one-hour halt in all stock trading on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. A decline of another 150 points on the same day would have triggered an additional two-hour delay.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s proposed $ 7 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, already surrounded by skepticism, was placed in further doubt Friday by a stock market drop blamed in part on problems in another airline buyout, analysts said. `` This seems to poison the atmosphere, at the very least, for airline buyouts involving a lot of debt,'' said one industry analyst who asked not to be named. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks fell 190.58 points after a management-pilot group said it could not obtain financing for a $ 6.75 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has proposed a $ 120-per-share buyout of Fort Worth-based <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but the company has not responded beyond a promise that it will consider the offer, although it prefers to remain independent. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has said he will include $ 1 billion of equity in his offer, but has provided no other financing details, leading to skepticism over his ability to complete the deal. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price slippped to $ 98.62 -LCB- Friday in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, before trading halted in the mad sell-off during the last hour of business. Trading was stopped because of an imbalance of orders for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>, with many more sellers than buyers. Although the close was down just 12 -LCB- cents from Thursday, it represented a $ 4.62 -LCB- drop during the day. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> had climbed to $ 103.25 before its slide began in early afternoon. The close was also the stock's lowest price since <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer was disclosed Oct. 5. Analysts expect the stock to continue to trade far below the level of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer until there is a significant move by either side. AMR officials would not comment on Friday's market developments; <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> did not return telephone calls. Analysts said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will have to lower his price if he expects to pull off the deal. `` If you look at history's precedents, those situations that were in an arbitrage environment were materially altered -LRB- by market swings -RRB- on the downside,'' said airline analyst <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> production workers announced plans Friday for a march on company headquarters, while the aerospace manufacturer prepared to make its fifth plane delivery since the walkout began. No date has been set for a resumption of contract negotiations, which ended Oct. 2, two days before the strike started. Industry analysts said the strike almost certainly would last another week and possibly two months or more. The 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees represented by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> were enjoying donations of pizza, supermarket food and other support. They also were being advised on ways to prepare for financial, marital and other pressures. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanham </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, representing 43,300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers in the Puget Sound area, said legislators, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and state and national labor leaders were being invited to a rally at the union hall and a march to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters Oct. 21 She said she hoped at least 2,000 people would participate. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to deliver the fifth plane since the strike began Oct. 4, a 747-400 for <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION>, said chief corporate spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. The planes were already assembled before the walkout, and non-striking employees have been putting the finishing touches on them. The company says it has about three dozen more planes that might be prepared for delivery while the workers are on strike. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Martinair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION> has ordered four more wide-body 767-300ER jetliners, worth approximately $ 326 million. So far this month, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received orders and options for 106 planes worth approximately $ 7.5 billion. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received firm orders for 792 planes worth about $ 42.3 billion, an industry record. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that nobody had expected a strike to last less than two weeks, `` so after this -LRB- weekend -RRB- the real strike begins, so to speak.'' Talks could resume in the next week, `` and in the next two weeks I think you might see some tangible motion,'' <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> said. `` I've said one to two months all along, and I do n't see any reason to change that,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bosworth </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s three-year offer included wage hikes of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause almost matching inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits. The unions are seeking bigger wage increases, less reliance on bonuses, and an end to mandatory overtime. By late Friday no union members in the region were known to be facing eviction or other financial crises, but enough were worried to keep five people almost constantly on the phone in the union's local welfare office, said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON>, a specialist from <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION> Similar services were being offered to union members in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and lesser <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> job sites in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and other states. <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON> said creditors generally were agreeing to accept reduced or delayed payments during the duration of the strike. `` When they get a creditor that's uncooperative, they call us and in some cases we call the creditor,'' he said. `` We tell them we'll take some pickets off the line and bring them over to the loan company,'' <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON> said. `` We have n't had one hold out on us yet.'' Under federal law the strikers are being offered five options for paying to retain some health, accident, death and disability insurance coverage, said <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Wydick </PERSON>, another health and welfare specialist. Without any advance word, a local pizza company sent delivery trucks with hot pizzas for pickets at a number of plant gates, <PERSON> Lanham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, owner of two <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION> outlets, loaned a 10-gallon cooler and is donating six gallons of orange-drink mix and 600 disposable cups a week, she said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> are letting the union select $ 50 worth of free goods from each of their three groceries every Wednesday, she said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> QFC </ORGANIZATION> supermarket in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> arranged for the union to get `` tons of produce and tons of bakery items,'' <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said.

 In response to the trading frenzy in the stock market Friday, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> adjusted computer filters that normally check the accuracy of trades reported by the exchanges. <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s computers, which process the financial markets tables published by most newspapers, are programmed to spot questionable trade reports and keep them out of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s database until they are checked. But many of the trades Friday dropped so sharply they would have triggered false alarms, which would have delayed preparation of stock market tables. Normally, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s computers are set to question trades that vary by more than 3 percent. In the wake of Friday's selloff, the gate was widened to accept any trades that changed by up to 50 percent. Adjusting the filters allowed <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s computers to better keep pace with Friday's heavy trading, but it also allowed some transaction reports that were reported erroneously by the exchanges to creep into <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s tables. Some high and low prices were affected. Closing prices were not. Before processing the weekly tables published in weekend editions, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> staffers manually reviewed the data and removed trades that were clearly reported incorrectly.

<TEXT>
 Wall Street closed out its weekly business Friday night reverberating with the echoes of the crash of 1987. In a setting fraught with parallels to the pre-weekend selloff that served as prelude to Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987, stock prices took a precipitous drop in the last hour of trading Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the day down 190.58 at 2,569.26, for a point loss exceeded in market history only by the 508-point debacle it suffered on Black Monday. The average's 216.26 drop for the week ranked third in the record books, behind declines of 235.48 and 295.98 Oct. 12-16 and Oct. 19-23 two years ago. Yet many Wall Street officials, brokers and investors went home for the weekend hopeful that history was n't repeating itself. `` The whole situation is significantly different this time,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, the organization that oversees the over-the-counter market. `` The circumstances are not comparable and the psychology is much stronger now,'' declared <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, the market seemed to be under assault from every direction. Interest rates were high and rising, the dollar was under pressure in foreign exchange, recession fears were mounting and, as everyone could plainly see later on, stock prices by any traditional measure were `` too high.'' This time, many analysts insist, none of those problems are present. The trouble, they say, lies in a single sore spot for the market _ credit worries and excessive speculation in corporate buyouts, real and rumored, financed with borrowed money. The news that opened the floodgates on Friday, by nearly unanimous agreement, was the disclosure by a labor-management group that it could n't get the bank loans needed to carry off its buyout plan for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That was the latest in a series of events in recent weeks that have shaken confidence in the market for `` junk'' bonds to finance takeovers, and prompted conjecture that the buyout boom of the 1980s on Wall Street might be approaching its end If it is true that the market has just one identifiable foe to contend with, the most important question left to be answered is whether Wall Street can limit the effects of the struggle to those stocks that have been involved in takeover deals and speculation. That was n't the way things looked on Friday, when the big blue chips untouched by the taint of takeovers suffered along with the so-called `` whisper'' stocks. Monday shapes up as `` a heavy day, perhaps a volatile day,'' <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON> acknowledged. `` But it could be on either side.'' Asked specifically about the buyout problem, he said, `` To the extent that people have seen this coming, I think it can be contained.'' Most broader measures of stock price trends ended the past week with losses not quite as severe as the Dow's. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell 11.42 to 185.56; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 16.35 to 467.29, and the Amex market value index was down 16.56 at 378.45. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 161.95 million shares a day, against 170.99 million the week before. The sudden slide on Friday appeared to some observers to have accelerated what was already being billed as the `` de-leveraging'' of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the wringing out of what many see as excessive use of debt in restructuring businesses of many descriptions. `` Since junk bonds were an important source of financing for the takeover boom, difficulty in raising this form of financing dilutes a positive underpinning for the market,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sass </PERSON>, chairman of the investment management firm M.D. <ORGANIZATION> Sass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, in a commentary written before Friday's drop. But `` from a longer term standpoint, weakness in the junk bond market has positive implications because it will result in more soundly financed and conceived corporate mergers, and help stem the sharp deterioration in corporate credit quality.'' Concluded <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>: `` The markets have a way of correcting these things. Sometimes it's painful.''

<TEXT>
 Several air courier companies have sued the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, claiming its low price for some overseas packages creates unfair and illegal competition. In a suit filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, the companies allege the government's $ 10.75 rate for express delivery overseas of packages weighing eight ounces or less `` results in unfair and illegal competition between the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and private enterprise carriers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> cut its rate for that category in April from $ 18 to $ 8.75 per package, which it described as a `` special introductory rate.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it filed suit seeking $ 1 billion in damages from <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and others over <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s courtship of film producers <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> to run <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, who produced the megahit `` Batman'' and other films for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, have been trying to get out of a recently signed five-year exclusive agreement to make films for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> In a suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> of inducing the two executives to breach their agreement so they could take top jobs at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and their company announced they had jointly filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The statement failed to say where the suit was filed, and a spokesman was unavailable to elaborate on it. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese electronics and recorded music giant, announced Sept. 27 that it had agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 3.4 billion. A tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s shares is to expire Nov. 6, but <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> said it intends to name <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> co-chairmen of the company once it is acquired. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> also has begun a tender offer to buy their production company, <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 200 million. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it has waived a condition in its agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> that would have allowed it o terminate the agreement if the executives were unable to obtain waivers from their contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. `` We became satisfied that the contracts represented no impediment to the acquisition,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON> said Friday. In addition to $ 1 billion in damages, the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> suit seeks punitive damages and an injunction preventing <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> from breaching their commitments to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, co-chairman and co-chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>' parent <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We regret that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to enter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> motion picture industry by illegally and willfully raiding key talent under exclusive contract to a competitor. `` This conduct can not, must not and will not be condoned,'' he said. Also named as defendants in the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> suit are <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Guber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, their company and two <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> executives, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Yetnikoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulhof </PERSON>. Calls placed to spokesmen for <PERSON> Guber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yetnikoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schulhof </PERSON> and the company were not returned or went unanswered. Among other movies that <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> were involved with for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> have been `` The Color Purple'' and `` The Witches of Eastwick.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> executives say the two men are involved in about 50 projects for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, including sequels to `` Batman'' and movie adaptations of the books `` Bonfire of the Vanities'' and `` A Bright Shining Lie.''

 The biggest selloff since the crash of 1987 rocked the stock market Friday, driving prices into a free-fall decline following news that a big buyout deal for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had fallen through. The sudden slide came almost exactly two years after a similar Friday-afternoon rout that preceded Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987. But many Wall Streeters insisted it was far too soon to declare that another collapse was in the making. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26. That marked its second biggest point drop ever, exceeded only by the 508-point loss recorded on Black Monday. On Monday of this week the average stood at a record closing high of 2,791.41. The market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most of Friday's session until the group planning to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> said it had been unable to get enough bank financing for the transaction it had planned. That quickly cast a pall over shares of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and other companies that have been involved in or are planning debt-financed deals. Brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the market for high-yielding `` junk'' bonds. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.9 percent in September, abruptly reversing a series of declines through the summer months. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> news `` was the trigger for the whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Also, it's October. Memories of 1987 are still very vivid.'' But `` this time it's different,'' asserted <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, portfolio manager of the Janus Fund and the Janus Venture Fund, two Denver-based mutual funds, who said he was a heavy buyer of selected stocks late Friday. `` Interest rates have been on the decline, and non-takeover-related stocks are not overvalued,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> totaled 251.17 million shares, up from 160.12 million in the previous session and the heaviest total since 254.87 million were traded on Jan. 27. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares were down 5 -LCB- at 279 -RCB- when trading in them was halted in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> markets after the news of the buyout problem broke. A dealer at one brokerage firm said the shares were being quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in a range of 230 to 240. Among other stocks involved in plans or speculation about possible buyout deals or other corporate transactions, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> fell 7 -RRB- to 55 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> 7 -RCB- to 69 \; <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> 5 -LRB- to 61 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> 4 -RRB- to As the crunch hit, however, blue-chip issues not involved in any takeover talk also took a drubbing. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> fell 6 -LRB- to 101 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> 3 -LCB- to 54 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> 8 -RCB- to 120 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> 2 -RCB- to 40, and <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> 7 -LCB- to 113. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 189.57 billion, or 5.44 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped 11.42 to 185.56. Declining issues swamped advances by about 11 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 153 up, 1,600 down and 228 unchanged. Consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 288.43 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 25.72 to 379.68, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 21.74 at 333.65.

 A failing airline buyout knocked the stock market off its record-setting pace with a sudden dive that erased more than 190 points from the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average and conjured memories of the 1987 crash. Nearly $ 200 billion was wiped out from the paper value of stocks as more than 250 million shares changed hands on Friday. Over 100 million shares were traded in the last hour following an announcement that the employee-led, highly leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had come unglued. The widely watched <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 190.58 points to 2,569.26, the biggest point drop since the crash of 1987.

<TEXT>
 Magazine investor <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said Friday he had completed his previously-disclosed plans to acquire control of Ms. and Sassy magazines, and said he plans to begin publishing Ms. without advertising. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but officials familiar with the transaction said it gives <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> a 70 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Matilda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, the company that has run both magazines for the past year. The remaining 30 percent interest is held by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. Ms., which has been an advocate for women's causes, has not been profitable in its 17 years of publication and has often been at odds with advertisers, <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said. `` We understand the advertising community's difficulty with buying advertising in an advocacy magazine, but it's a major problem in growing the magazine to profitability,'' he said. `` In order to serve the reader, Ms. must be published without external pressures,'' he said, explaining the decision to quit taking advertising. Ms. is currently a monthly magazine with a circulation of 550,000. Sassy, launched in March 1988 with a rate base of 250,000, has grown since to a circulation of 450,000. It is aimed at teenage girls.

 Spooky deja vu pervaded the financial markets as a wave of panic selling swept Wall Street and evoked unsettling parallels with the stock crash of October 1987. The collapse two years ago, which rocked the financial markets and wiped out around $ 500 billion in wealth, haunted the memories of stock traders Friday as the market sustained another body blow. `` Nobody believes in witchcraft, but we're seeing the same type of phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private economist in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and president of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Obviously, people are going to lose some money.'' Friday's drop was of a similar magnitude to the market's slide on Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, three days before Black Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled around 190 points, or 6.9 percent, compared with its 108-point, 4-percent, slide on Oct. 16. The events surrounding the two market breaks show remarkable similarities that go well beyond size and the fact that they happened at the same time of year. At both times, for example, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was agonizing over its monetary policy and interest rates overseas were headed higher. In the fall of 1987 it was then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> wrangling over exchange-rate policy. In recent weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> have been squabbling over how to drive down the dollar _ which has defied efforts by the big industrial powers to reduce its value. Closer to home, it's deja vu as the administration wrestles again with the intractable budget deficit and inflationary pressures. This time, a dispute over the capital-gains tax cut pushed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has delayed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on a related $ 14 billion deficit-cutting bill. Unless that legislation is passed by Monday, automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs _ expected to total about $ 16 billion _ will take effect. And inflation is rearing its head. The government reported Friday that a sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a rebound in wholesale price inflation in September, wiping out three rare monthly declines this summer. The congressional morass surrounding the capital gains issue is reminiscent of the battle two years ago over interest deductions for borrowing for corporate takeovers. Mergers and acquisitions, a hot issue in late 1987 and red-hot now, played a key role in both situations. Back then, the markets fretted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would hem in leveraged buyouts with restrictions. Now, the ability of their organizers to finance the takeovers is being questioned and has the market spooked. That fear mushroomed into the catalyst for Friday's plunge, as the pilot-management group proposed to take over <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 6.75 billion admitted that it could n't secure the needed financing. On both Fridays, computer-driven program trading exacerbated the panic and swelled the selling wave. But it was much more of a factor on Oct. 16, 1987 than Friday _ when the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> announcement and anxiety over the market for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds threw the market into a nose dive.

 Panic stock selling is n't likely to jolt the economy much beyond Wall Street, but if the losses deepen the effect could become more profound, economists and investors say. `` I'll sleep just as good tonight as I did last night,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a 78-year-old retiree from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> with a portfolio of more than $ 1 million, after a panic selloff Friday that sent the Dow Jones Industrial average to its second steepest single-day point loss ever, down 190.58 to 2,569.26. He estimated Friday's market break cost him $ 10,000. The one-day loss would likely have little immediate effect on most households. But if the selling spilled into future sessions, some economists worried that consumer spending could plunge and the health of small businesses could be affected. For the most part, investors, especially long-time ones with experience with the market's ups and downs, seemed unperturbed. `` It really will not have a major effect on my lifestyle,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Harden </PERSON>, who has a computer software and consulting business in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> and puts his market holdings at $ 400,000. `` At this point I'm not deeply concerned. Since I'm a long-term investor, I'm not going to get excited. I'll ride it through,'' he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest group representing small investors, said he saw little panic among traders in the aftermath of Friday's losses. `` An awful lot of our investors have been here before,'' <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> where his group was holding a convention. `` Among the new investors, you'll find some people who are definitely disappointed, but most of our members were n't planning on selling their stocks tomorrow,'' he said. `` If it stops here, the impact will be small,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` As far as the behavior of households, the impact would be trivial. Even the huge crash of October'87 had a discernible impact but not an enormous effect on household behavior and consumption.'' But he and others worried that if the market slump continued, small businesses trying to raise capital might find that harder, and sustained stock market losses could eventually take a bite out of housing, car and durable goods sales. `` Things can mushroom,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` I would hope things can be stopped quickly.'' Since Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow average dropped a record 508 points, small investor portfolios have risen 26.8 percent, according to Money Magazine's Small Investor Index, an average annual return of 12.7 percent. `` To me the sad part is that more people will be scared away. It has a bad effect on the people who just joined the market or were thinking of joining it, and we need those people,'' said <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> stock market expert, said in an interview this week that his biggest worry is the impact of market losses on small companies, which make up about one-third of the business market. He said their stocks are priced relatively high, their earnings are extremely volatile, and their growth in sales and profits is generally poor. `` Small companies really represent the financial future of this country,'' <PERSON> Arbel </PERSON> said. `` Traditionally, that's the sector of the economy where growth and innovation come from. Weakness in the sector is equivalent to weakness in our youth. It's highly significant for the future.'' In an even more pessimistic assessment, <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Batra </PERSON>, professor of international economics at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and author of `` The Great Depression of 1990,'' said the market plunge could augur `` the coming Great Depression.'' `` There's an extremely high concentration of debt. There are too many poor people and too many rich people. The ocean of debt is very vast.''

 The plunge in stock prices left Wall Street workers dazed, grim and debating whether another crash is coming Monday. One man stood on a street corner across from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Friday, shook his head and said to a friend, `` I'm trying to figure out whether I got my head handed to me.'' Some financial workers went to drown their sorrows at <PERSON> Houlihan </PERSON>'s bar, around the corner from the exchange One trader put down his beer, spread his hands two feet apart and said: `` I've got a hole in my underwear this big.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 190.58 points Friday. Nearly $ 200 billion was wiped out from the paper value of stocks as more than 250 million shares changed hands. Almost exactly two years ago, on Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average dropped 108 points. That Monday _ Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987 _ it plummeted 508 points. Some predicted a similar crash next week. `` There's going to be a huge selloff on Monday,'' said another <PERSON> Houlihan </PERSON>'s patron, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Durand </PERSON>, a bank stocks trader. `` I thought it was all over two years ago. But I never thought it would happen again,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, a stock exchange floor reporter who would not give his last name, as he left the building after Friday's closing bell. `` I need a drink,'' he added. But stockbroker <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was defiantly optimistic: `` This is not going to be like Black Monday. The market is going to stick on Monday, absolutely. What we had today was just panic selling.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON>, retail stockbrokers having an after-work drink at the South Street Seaport near <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, said Friday's drop actually stirred up business. `` I got many, many buy orders at the close,'' <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON> said. The market drop creates bargains for investors who like to buy when prices are low. <PERSON> LaBorde </PERSON> dismissed comparisons with the 1987 disaster. `` There were a lot more problems with the economy back then,'' he said. `` This time, it's nothing really,'' agreed <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>. `` It's just an adjustment.'' He added: `` We're bullish.'' Options traders <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Schure </PERSON> were not. Interviewed as they left their offices across the street from the stock exchange, <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said: `` Monday's going to be a scary day. People have all weekend to think about this.'' Schure added: `` Most people took hits today. One guy I know went down for $ 150,000.'' Many financial workers pointed to the failed leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as the trigger for the plunge in Friday's prices. But another patron of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, a bond traer who would not give his last name, said he thought the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> deal was merely a symptom of a deeper illness. `` The country is not in the euphoric financial state everyone says it is,'' he said. `` We've got a huge deficit and the thrift industry is falling apart. `` The stock market is like a house of cards,'' he added. `` I see more of this happening on Monday.''
