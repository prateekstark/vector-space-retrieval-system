 <PERSON> Suzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> became the first woman mayor in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> history Saturday with a landslide victory over fellow city council member <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> in a runoff election. `` I'm thrilled to death. I'm ready to go to work,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> said. `` One hundred seventeen years is a long time for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> to wait, and I'm glad they waited for me.'' The final, but unofficial totals showed that Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> captured 65 percent of the votes, or 29,961, to only 35 percent, or 16,218, for <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>. `` When you get a margin like 65 percent, that's a mandate from the people that they're willing to work with you,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> said. The successor to Mayor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who by law had to step down after four consecutive two-year terms, will face problems posed by widespread poverty and rapid growth. Unlike most <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> has a strong-mayor form of government with no city manager.

<TEXT>
 The new mayor is expected to grapple with a high car-theft and house burglary rate, a growing youth gang problem, shockingly high rates of hepatitis and tuberculosis in outlying areas, double-digit unemployment and a steady influx of Mexicans, many of whom work illegally for low wages. Nonetheless, the runoff was almost devoid of issues until two weeks ago, when <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> brought up the matter of Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s finances. Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, leases business property from the city-owned airport, and <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> said he wanted to know how much the Azars made from businesses on the property. At <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>'s prodding, Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> released a statement showing that she and her husband had a net worth of about $ 3.7 million. <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>, owner of a medical supply business, has a net worth of about a tenth as much. The two city council members defeated four other candidates in the May 6 general election to make it to Saturday's showdown. Before the May 6 election, the six-candidate campaign focused on taxes, police protection and economic development. But <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> held similar views, and <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> chose to stress personal wealth as a campaign issue. El Paso's elections are non-partisan and there are no party primaries. <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> is a Republican and Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> is a Democrat.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of students formed a huge procession Sunday and left <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to march through central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to press their demands for democratic reforms. March leaders said students from up to 300 schools and institutes would join the march at various points around the capital. One student from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the goal of the march is `` to have Chinese from throughout the world unite'' in demanding that the government grant greater political freedom. Many carried signs demanding the resignations of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20, and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. Authorities did not try to stop the marchers as they set out. Unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to a million people to sprawling Tiananmen square, including thousands of workers, there appeared to be few people who were not students in Sunday's procession Student leaders said workers would probably stay away. `` Factories are now taking economic measures against workers who participate,'' one student leader said. Some, he said, have had their pay docked. However, thousands of people lined the streets and crowded onto overpasses to cheer on the marchers. `` Do n't stop,'' some in the crowd yelled. `` We wo n't let you down,'' students shouted back. On Saturday, student leaders proposed that demonstrators hold a climactic rally Tuesday to `` celebrate our great victory'' and then end their historic two-week occupation of Tiananmen Square. The call came as hardliners expanded their purge of moderates, whose sympathy for the students triggered the fiercest power struggle since the leftist ideological purges of the Cultural Revolution. Student leaders said it was time to change tactics in their push for greater freedom and an end to official corruption. But they said protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, whose numbers had fallen sharply to about 10,000, would have the final say on ending the sit-in. Top student leaders <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON> held a news conference at the square and called for a city-wide march Tuesday to culminate the protest movement that began April 15. Also Saturday, President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> made the first public acknowledgement that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was experiencing a power struggle, accusing some <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders of plotting to create confusion in the country. Sources said officials in the media, the party and the army suspected of participating in the protest movement were being told to write `` reports'' detailing their activities. The reports could be used against them, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The developments came two days after <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was reportedly stripped of power and placed under house arrest. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s fall signaled a victory for the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and other leaders who oppose political reform. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s ouster must be confirmed by a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected soon. Party officials from provinces and cities were gathering in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to prepare for the meeting, sources said. Sources said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been accused of heading an anti-party clique. One diplomat referred to the clique as a `` new Gang of Four,'' a reference to ultra-leftist radicals who ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the last years of the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. They were purged by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> when he took power in 1978. Included with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> are Politburo member <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>, Chinese sources said. Chinese and diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> used his influence to keep troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> from enforcing martial law. Millions of people have taken to the streets in defiance of martial law, and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents put up blockades to prevent troops from entering the city. Students waiting Saturday at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> railroad station to go home said they would bring their message out to the countryside. `` We have to tell the people to arise, including peasants, workers, intellectuals and others from every walk of life,'' said a 24-year-old student from <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> who asked not to be identified. Tens of thousands of students have occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> since May 13, when they began a hunger strike. But over the past week, thousands have returned to their schools in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and elsewhere and the capital has returned to normal. `` We just feel the movement is ready to take a new form,'' said one student. `` We are ready to print newspapers and conduct speeches.'' The student leaders called for April 27 to be made into a holiday commemorating their movement. On that day, hundreds of thousands marched in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to protest a People's Daily editorial denouncing the student movement. In the first public acknowledgement of a power struggle, former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> accused `` certain people in the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' of creating confusion in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, an apparent reference to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. `` These people have an organization, a plan and a plot,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was quoted as saying on television news. `` If they succeed, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be thrown into a deep disaster.'' In another blow to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s faction, state-run media said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, chairman of the standing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, had thrown his support to conservatives During a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week, Wan made statements expressing sympathy for the students. `` After I had time to study the situation,'' Wan was quoted as saying in a letter, `` I realized that a small minority was behind a plot to cause turmoil in society.''

 Nearly 300 people were kept from their homes Saturday while investigators tried to find out why an underground gasoline pipeline blew up in the same spot where a train derailed two weeks earlier. Two people, and possibly a third, were killed in the explosion, which enveloped a suburban neighborhood in a cauldron of gas-fed flames Thursday morning. `` We are still searching, still investigating the area,'' said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Bernita </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON>. An angry city official, meanwhile, said the owner of the pipeline had proposed to move the rebuilt line closer to homes that survived the rupture and explosion, rather than farther away as the city has urged. `` This has to be one of the most callous examples of corporate greed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said. `` After killing those people they are going to move the pipeline closer to the survivors.'' <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> officials decided that the city's proposal to move the 14-inch pressurized fuel line to the far side of the railroad tracks, about a mile away from any homes, `` is going to cost them too much money.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>, said the company wants to move the pressurized fuel pipeline only about 3 feet east of its existing route `` to obviate any safety concerns whatsoever to the existing pipe.'' Although the city's proposal for relocating the pipeline was discussed, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said, `` I told him that he lives in a hopelessly unrealistic world, and that every major regulatory agency agrees that the pipeline should remain where it is.'' <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> also planned to ask a federal judge to issue an order prohibiting <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> and other city officials from interfering with <LOCATION> Calnev </LOCATION> employees working in the area. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> allegedly threatened to order <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> police to shoot <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> employees if they try to dig a new trench, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, an investigator from the federal <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the dispute at a news conference Saturday evening. Ten homes were destroyed and five were damaged in the eight-hour fire. Seventy homes were evacuated, and Ms. <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> said it was unclear when the 270 displaced people would be be allowed to return home. The area was barricaded to keep out the curious and there was a round-the-clock watch. `` At this point, there is no danger of fire or explosion,'' Ms. <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> said. The death toll from official sources has fluctuated, rising to three, then reduced to two. On Saturday the city police spokeswoman said there were three dead: a woman, another adult and a child. But Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedgwick </PERSON> said as far as he knew the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office had received two bodies. The explosion occurred just days after experts assured city officials and residents that <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s underground pipeline had escaped damage from the May 12 train wreck. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight train flew off curving tracks atop an embankment and smashed a row of homes on Duffy Street. Two trainmen and two boys in a home were killed. The train fell atop the ground where the pipe is buried. The cause of the blast remained under investigation, but <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> manager <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> has said the pipe might have been damaged by the wreck. After the blast, pieces of metal were found in the ground near the pipe and were identified as pieces of a locomotive and a brake assembly from one of the runaway train's cars, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. What ignited the fuel also remained unknown. A train passed over the tracks 10 minutes before the blast but no connection was immediately drawn. The city and an attorney for more than 100 residents announced plans to file lawsuits against the pipeline company. The residents also plan to sue the city and the rail line, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> provided vouchers for food, clothing and lodging to the evacuees. `` The residents are still in the motels and they will remain there until they get with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and decide what they will do,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The pipeline carried gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from a tank farm in <LOCATION> Colton </LOCATION>, several miles from the blaze site, to southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, supplying the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> with 90 percent of its fuel. The flow of fuel through the pipeline was shut off when an automatic alarm signaled a drop in pressure, said <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON> general manager in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. However, up to 12,000 gallons of gasoline burned. The explosion was expected to cause a five-cent increase in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> gasoline prices over the Memorial Day weekend, suppliers reported. The price hike was prompted by the cost of having to ship gasoline and diesel fuel by tanker truck rather than the pipeline.

 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and unions representing about 160,000 workers were near agreement on new contracts early Sunday, resolving disputes over medical benefits and wages in a frenetic day of bargaining Saturday and working through the night on a few remaining details. Disputes over certain job-classification titles and exact contract language covering some areas of agreement blocked a settlement. But, believing an agreement was at hand, the two unions agreed to bargain overnight and terms of contracts due to expire just before midnight Saturday were extended until further notice. `` It's a speck we expect to work out,'' a company official said of the final dispute. `` We think we'll have it done by daybreak -LRB- Sunday -RRB-,'' a union official said. In the overall agreement being worked out by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and the unions was a wage and profit-sharing package that should bring workers raises of more than 10 percent over three years, a source said. It is the first time <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has offered profit sharing to its union workers. The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the unions had fought off <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s demand that workers pay more up front for health care costs, the issue that dominated the talks from their outset in March. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> won concessions allowing it to amend certain job titles and thereby expand the duties of certain workers, the source said. Also included was a package of parental, family and elder-care leave provisions. The family and elder-care provisions would allow workers to take six months off to care for a sick parent, spouse or child without losing seniority, the source said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would continue health insurance during the leave, the source said. And, in a proposal <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> offered on the final day in hopes of brokering a settlement, the company agreed to create a fund to support new and existing child care centers. The company-union fund reportedly would total $ 5 million. If the remaining disputes are resolved, union and company officials plan a joint news conference Sunday afternoon. An agreement would avert a possible holiday weekend strike by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s union workers, although the unions had not been expected to immediately call a strike even if there were not an agreement Saturday. The new contracts would be subject to rank-and-file ratification and would replace contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> that expired at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday. It appeared as late as Saturday afternoon that no agreement would be reached by the deadline as sources on both sides reported little movement on the health insurance fight. But by early evening there was renewed optimism, spawned by progress made in a series of private meetings between <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's top negotiator and two ranking union officials. Those sessions led to progress at the formal bargaining sessions, and as the existing contracts entered their final hours both sides said an agreement before the deadline was possible. But both sides girded for a possible walkout nonetheless. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T had several thousand managers on alert, their bags packed in case they were dispatched around the country to replace strikers. The unions used computer networks with locals across the nation to update members on the status of the talks and plans for implementing a nationwide labor boycott of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T long distance had union leaders _ in the event no agreement was reached _ picked that strategy instead of an immediate strike. A strike would have been the third against <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in nine years. <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers did not honor <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 strike, allowing <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> to keep half its manufacturing plants open. The two unions negotiated jointly for the first time this year. The talks, the largest single-employer collective bargaining session this year, took on added significance because they will affect negotiations later this year for nearly 500,000 union workers at regional phone companies. Also, major corporations seeking to curb soaring health care costs were eager to see whether <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could pass some of the bill to workers. The unions were determined to prevent the company from slicing its $ 1 billion annual medical bill at the union workers' expense, and from the start of the talks demanded expanded benefits while promising to work with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T on cost-control measures they said would save millions of dollars. Job security was the third major issue behind health insurance and wages, and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T made a significant concession in that area on Friday by offering to limit its use of temporary workers. That and other developments brought the first reports of significant progress with little more than 24 hours remaining in the existing contracts. Negotiators returned to the bargaining table at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel Saturday after just a few hours of sleep. Overshadowing their work were periodic private meetings among <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, a top aide to <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's top negotiator, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the company's vice president for labor relations. Those sessions were the key to breaking the impasse over health insurance. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's initial wage package, presented formally on Monday, included base wage increases and lump sum payments for both operating and manufacturing employees and the company's first profit-sharing plan for union workers. Included in that proposal was the company's demand that employees be required to pay 20 percent of doctors and hospital bills _ up to $ 1,000 a year in addition to deductibles _ and 25 percent of the premiums for dependent care. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T employees do not currently pay for dependent care and pay only annual deductibles ranging from $ 150 to $ 300 for medical care. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it needed the increased worker contribution to cut an annual medical bill of $ 1 billion. According to company estimates, the negotiations affected about 21,500 long-distance operators, 35,500 in-house and field technicians, 37,000 manufacturing employees and 54,000 other personnel in clerical, administrative, sales and other positions.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid tribute Sunday to Americans slain in World War II and said their sacrifices demonstrate that the West needs `` a strong military deterrent'' to preserve freedom and democracy. On the eve of a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit threatened by discord over nuclear weapons policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed to the postwar generation of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and Europeans to remain vigilant against military threats. He spoke at a Memorial Day weekend ceremony in a grassy cemetery on <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s west coast, where nearly 8,000 Americans are buried from World War II, and then paid a surprise visit to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> which was anchored in nearby waters. `` We only had 10 minutes, we wanted to show the flag,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, as he arrived aboard the carrier by helicopter. The president returned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, at midday for the two-day summit of Western allies which begins Monday. Seeing him off were Italian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> and outgoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON>. Accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, the president flew here by helicopter from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to lay a wreath and attend Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has only six pews seating about 70 people. On his way to the church, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade was halted briefly by right-wing demonstrators who threw handbills and formed a human pyramid in the road. The road was quickly cleared by police, and a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the president was never in danger. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> late Friday night, planned to travel to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> later in the day for Monday's opening of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. In remarks prepared for delivery at the cemetery, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the white crosses and Stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON> marking the graves here and around the world were `` a silent tribute to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s battles for freedom in this century.'' `` As I reflect on this scene and anticipate the dynamic and forward-looking <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of the 1990s, I think of generations of young people on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> who have grown up in peace and prosperity. `` With no experience of the horror and destruction of war,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it may be difficult for them to understand why we need to keep a strong military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve freedom and democracy. `` The answer is here, among the quiet of the graves,'' the president said. The remarks echoed the sentiment he voiced last Sunday in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when he said he was concerned about `` a growing complacency'' throughout the West. `` As we gather today,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it is dawn in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Memorial Day weekend. `` And as the sun rises and the summer begins, the images both here and at home are of countries that are prosperous and secure, countries confident of their place in the world and aware of the responsibility that comes with that place,'' he said. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders already have started gathering for Monday's summit. The atmosphere of the meeting has been marred by a dispute largely between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on one side and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on the other. Amid a tide of disarmament sentiment, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has demanded that the West open negotiations soon with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to reduce short-range nuclear missiles in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Most of the weapons are based in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and, if used, would fall on German soil. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also is resisting plans to modernize the missiles to make them faster and increase their range. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has opposed negotiations about the missiles, arguing they are needed to offset the big advantage in conventional forces by the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. There also are fears in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that any negotiations to reduce the number of missiles would create public pressure to eliminate them entirely.

 Siamese twins who were joined at the chest and abdomen and shared a liver were successfully separated at the Government Hospital on Sunday, officials said. The 7-month-old girls were in stable condition in an intensive care unit following an eight-hour operation conducted by a team of 40 people. Dr. <PERSON> Goon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooi </PERSON>, one of two team leaders, told reporters the operation left each girl with a liver that should function normally. He said the doctors used new equipment during the procedure. One device, an ultrasonic dissector, reduced bleeding during the separation of the liver by allowing the doctors to break its cells without damaging important blood vessels. The second device, a tissue expander, was used to stretch the tissues, providing additional skin to cover the girls' wounds.

<TEXT>
 Moslem rebels have launched a new offensive to capture the embattled eastern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, but there were conflicting reports Sunday of their success. Rebel sources said the mujahedeen, or Islamic `` holy warriors,'' began attacking communist government positions from all four sides Saturday. They claimed to have captured several government military posts and killed or wounded at least 70 communist troops. Rebels losses were put at about 10 dead. However, official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said government forces repulsed the attack and gained new territory around the city. It said 55 `` enemy elements'' were killed and 46 were wounded. Both sides of the Afghan civil war often make exaggerated claims that contradict each other and usually can not be verified independently. The mujahedeen, backed primarily by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have fought unsuccessfully for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> since March 6. The battle began about three weeks after Soviet troops pulled the last of their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, ending nine years of military support for the Marxist government. Afghan forces still hold the country's major cities but the guerrillas reportedly control more than 90 percent of the countryside. Communist troops have withstood relentless rebel rocket and artillery attacks on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, where they still control the city center and the military airport to the east. Guerrilla leaders earlier predicted that the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government would fall within weeks or months of the Soviet troop withdrawal. However, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has said his forces' tenacious defense of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> proves the guerrills can not win a military victory in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He has made repeated overtures for peace talks with the insurgents, but they have refused. <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> leaders blame the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> for inviting the Soviet military intervention. They demand a complete capitulation of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and the establishment of an Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Fighting since the Soviet pullout has concentrated on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 42 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, and most recently <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, a garrison town to the south. Rebel commanders also say they are preparing an all-out assault on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrilas during the weekend claimed to have overrun at least three government posts around <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, killing 50 soldiers and capturing four officers since Thursday. They said 18 rebels were killed. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, however, claimed Saturday night that 173 mujahedeen were killed and 32 were wounded. Foreign observers estimate that some 1.5 million Afghans have died in the past 11 years of civil war. More than 5 million Afghans, about one-third of the country's pre-war population of 15 million, live as refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

The semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said four men armed with automatic weapons fled in a car after the attack late Saturday. The agency quoted witnesses as saying the gunmen shouted they were firing in the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed group that seeks to set up a Marxist state in parts of eastern and southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Last week, 22 Kurdish guerrillas and 10 soldiers were killed in three separate clashes. More than 900 civilians and security personnel and about as many Kurdish insurgents have been killed since the guerrilla campaign began in 1984. Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s population of 55 million.

 The people of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, who saw their own dreams of democracy brutally crushed last year, are gaining inspiration from the student uprising in neighboring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Defying an army ban on demonstrations, 12 students rallied outside the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus one day last week and shouted slogans supporting the students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat reported. Tin Oo, chairman of the main opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that authorities detained six activists who pasted posters on trees in the capital proclaiming support for the Chinese students. He said the activists sought legal advice from him. Millions in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> last year followed university students and marched in the streets shouting for an end to decades of repression. They forced the resignation of three presidents and ended the one-party system, but today they still live under a military-run government. The Burmese government's response to the protests was much harsher than <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s _ troops shot to death thousands of peaceful demonstrators, and in September the military reestablished control and banned protests. `` At least the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has some respect for the students,'' said <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zun </PERSON>, a 24-year-old student leader who fled to the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border to escape arrest for organizing demonstrations. `` In <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, the students were just shot down in the streets.'' Before fleeing, he was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the main student-led political party in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. At rallies this month, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the other leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, contrasted the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's attitude with the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leaders' adamant refusal to make any contact at all with dissidents She was campaigning in the central city of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> for a general election that the government has promised for May 1990. `` We started with a students' movement, so everyone has strong feelings for what is happening in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said Tin Oo, reached by telephone in the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He was refering to the country's tradition of student activism, beginning with the campaign that led to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s state-run press has carried nothing on the events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the government has made no official comment. But people have been following developments on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The uprising in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has boosted the morale of some of the 3,000 students who remain along the border with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> after fleeing last year's military crackdown in the cities. They are living in harsh conditions in the malarial jungles, where ethnic groups are fighting a 40-year-old war for greater autonomy. `` It makes them realize they are not alone,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zun </PERSON> said. `` They can see there are people like them struggling for democracy.'' But he said many students are upset that the world press that once ran the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> uprising on its front pages now gives it little coverage. `` It is particularly sad as the students in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> went through even greater hardships than those in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Now it is not worthy of page one, even though there are many still suffering.''

<HEAD>Communists Run on Their Record in Poland's Strange New Experiment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a land where people must wait decades for an apartment or telephone and pay inflated prices for scarce goods, how does a party in power for nearly half a century run on its record? Such is the dilemma facing the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as it prepares for the June 4 elections to parliament, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first somewhat democratic balloting since World War II. The communists are being challenged by a well-organized, emotionally driven opposition led by the newly legalized Solidarity labor movement. Solidarity, with the luster of novelty and the aura of idealism, is awash in campaign contributions and volunteers. At a converted coffee house in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Constitution Square, the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, workers almost trip over each other to get out campaign literature, deliver placards, sign up poll watchers and instruct citizens on voting procedures. A few blocks away, in a state-owned department store, the party-led coalition's campaign headquarters is almost empty. One campaign workers is on duty, his piles of leaflets sitting idle and unread. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who ordered the crackdown that led to Solidarity's suppression in 1981 and initiated the conciliation that resulted in its legalization this year, has said the communist party must be prepared to face the electoral test. Party spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said despite <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s dire economic problems, the party can point to some achievements during its 45 years in power. `` We had 45 years of peace. ... At all our borders, we had friends. It means something,'' he said. `` We changed the classes in our country. We had a majority of peasants.'' Now, a majority has moved to an urban life, and `` we have a huge intelligentsia.'' All this took `` tremendous economic, social and political effort,'' he said. `` So it is very unjust to enter the political campaign looking for errors and defeats.'' More important than the past is the future, he said. The party is campaigning on the premise that it is the best bet for ensuring political and economic reform. Of all the political forces in the country, he said, the party is in the strongest position to guarantee that reforms actually will be carried out. `` To say that the reforms just started now _ it is not true,'' he said. `` Always in our party, the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, it was a trend to adopt our policy to the actual situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The party pitches itself as pragmatic and practical, implying Solidarity is not. Banners around <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> say: `` With us, it's surer,'' and `` We have a realistic program. Missing is any reference to the communist party itself. Instead of the party's Polish initials, PZPR, posters bear a logo with a red mermaid, a city symbol used by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> `` coalition'' of party candidates and those of allied groups. At stake in all of this are 460 seats in the existing parliament, the Sejm, and 100 seats in the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition is allotted only 161 seats in the Sejm, with the rest reserved for the communists. But the race for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is wide open. The new system was one of the agreements that came out of two months of talks between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s regime agreed to the talks after a series of crippling labor strikes last year. It is seeking Solidarity's help in putting in place unpopular measures to overhaul the nation's sickly economy In return, among other things, Solidarity was made legal again and elections were made freer. The <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has named just one candidate for each of the parliament races it can enter. The party's slate is less clearly defined. For example, there are more than 30 candidates on the ballot for three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Three represent Solidarity, but the party has never clearly announced which of the others it supports. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Szymborski </PERSON>, a party propaganda department employee manning the coalition's <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> campaign center, says that is because the party wanted to let the people decide. Some opposition leaders have suggested the party's strategy includes trying to confuse voters. Candidate names are to appear on lengthy and complicated ballots with no indication of affiliation. Although the party has been in power since the reestablishment of a Polish government after World War II and claims a membership of 2 million -LRB- about 5 percent of the population -RRB-, it has been trailing the opposition in opening campaign offices, announcing a platform and putting up posters. `` If you are talking about visual propaganda, for certain we were behind the Solidarity side,'' <PERSON> Szymborski </PERSON> conceded, saying the party was slower to pick its candidates. But he said the party is dealing more specifically with the issues. `` Solidarity first of all is basing its campaign on its name and its sign, and our campaign is more complicated and wider,'' he grumbled.

 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ A decade ago, police scrubbed down <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Democracy Wall and stifled the calls for political reform that sowed the seeds of today's protests for greater freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Democracy Wall, so named because it was laden with posters calling for democratic reform, came to represent the early political dissent that was crushed by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s supreme leader The political tremors of 10 years ago presaged the current upheaval by millions of student-led protesters, but there are major differences between the so-called <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Spring of 1979 and that of 1989. The movement then was mostly underground and disorganized and involved a few thousand people, mostly working-class men. It was far more strident and revolutionary than the past six weeks of jubilant demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Then, there were no live television interviews with loquacious, hopeful demonstrators in Western clothes. There were no rock concerts. In December, 1978 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> restored diplomatic relations. The next year witnessed the flowering and the end of the Democracy Wall, in the same central square where today's students have centered their protests Ten years ago, the movement was fierce in rhetoric, more negative than positive. Many dissidents likened Communism to fascism and denounced <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as a modern emperor and tyrant. They did n't know exactly what they wanted, or how to get it, but they knew they did n't want the status quo. `` We do n't want Communism, socialism, capitalism or any other ` ism' _ we want nationalism and the best for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' dissidents said. They were branded as counterrevolutionaries out to wreck Chinese modernization. In 1979 it took a special courage to stand up to the powerful state machinery that did not tolerate criticism. Ordinary citizens were afraid to speak out in support of the demonstrators, poster writers, artists and poets who clamored for change. Many were afraid to speak to foreigners, because they might be interrogated by police. In demonstrations, police did not hesitate to disperse crowds using force. Some who dared speak out were beaten and jailed, some lost their jobs. One editor of an underground magazine, <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, was tried and convicted as a traitor in 1979. He was sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp, where some say he went mad and died. But all that was before sweeping economic reforms gave people greater independence and confidence, before glasnost and greater freedom began to sweep the Communist world. Now, millions of people nationwide have defied the government and martial law with marches and demands for democracy, party reform and an end to endemic official corruption. Demonstrators have demanded the ouster of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and his hard-line protege, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. They have shouted, chanted, and they blocked army tanks when <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law. About 3,000 went on a hunger strike. Though today's protest leaders face danger, there is official recognition of legitimate demands for greater freedom. The men and women today are disciplined and organized, and more important, they are backed by ordinary citizens. Their strength lies in numbers, mass support, reasonable demands for reform and a clean Communist government. They do n't demand revolution. Even the government calls most of them patriots. The student demands have been treated sympathetically by the official Chinese press, which has even joined the protests. Democracy Wall, a gray stone barricade between a bus yard and central Tiananmen Square, was the focus of the movement 10 years ago, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was emerging from the Cultural Revolution and beginning to open to the outside world. The wall, 200 yards long and three yards high, became a billboard for big character posters, a staging ground for activism, a gallery for dissident artists, and a marketplace for ideas and unofficial magazines. It made headlines in November 1978 when <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> exploited it to discredit political opponents who banished him during the Cultural Revolution. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> himself reportedly named it `` Democracy Wall.'' `` Wall posters are not forbidden ... they are a constitutional right and if the masses feel some anger, we must let them express it,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said in late 1978. But he also said the masses sometimes were confused. Then, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, the architect of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms and open door, decided that free speech had gone too far. On Dec. 7, 1979, big character posters were prohibited. Workers used scrapers, shovels, rakes, brooms, spatulas, steel wool and eradicated the offending posters _ but not the ideas.

<HEAD>Official Report Says Soviet Troops Planned Massacre in Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers planned to massacre people during a pro-independence rally last month in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and used clubs to beat the injured and the elderly, an official report says. The report, issued by a Georgian commission that looked into the April 9 clash that left 19 dead, was circulated among deputies to the new Soviet parliament, which met during the weekend. The report calls for the parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, to condemn the incident and determine who exactly was responsible `` Otherwise,'' the report said, `` a shadow will be laid across the Soviet government as a whole.'' The report gives a horrifying account of troops' behavior in the 4 a.m. clash with protesters. It also supports claims of <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists who accused soldiers of extreme brutality. Soldiers `` blocked crossings, surrounded citizens and beat them with clubs and shovels. They did not spare hunger strikers, girls, old women, doctors and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers. They pursued people who were running away and beat the wounded even more, tearing them from the hands of medical personnel,'' the report says. `` We come to the conclusion that the action taken ... carries the signs of a punitive operation _ a planned mass massacre, committed with special cruelty,'' the commission reported. The panel, sponsored by the Georgian parliament, also said Georgian television announced a curfew the day after the clash only four minutes before it went into effect, so many residents were caught on the streets unaware. One young man was shot and killed for violating the curfew. It said the Soviet media distorted coverage of the clash and its aftermath and it blamed local leaders for `` complete isolation from the people.'' A medical subcommittee's findings repeated widespread criticism of the Defense and Interior Ministries for not telling doctors for several days exactly what sort of gas was used to control protesters. Western doctors who conducted autopsies have said the gases, described as suffocants, caused some of the deaths. Also, more than 4,000 people have required treatment, mainly for poisoning, and diagnosis and treatment would have been much easier if authorities had acknowledged earlier that they used a chemical agent, the report said. A Soviet magazine recently carried an interview with Georgian chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Vakhtang </PERSON> <PERSON> Razmadze </PERSON>, who said representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the government and the military attended the meeting at which the decision was made to use troops to break up the demonstration. They included Georgian party chief <PERSON> Zhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON>, who later resigned, General <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON>, the regional military commander, who is now a deputy at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and a deputy national defense minister. The account was consistent with a claim made Thursday by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said he and other Politburo members found out about the decision to bring in troops only hours after the damage was done. Protests began in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s capital, in early April in response to demands by the Abkhazian minority in <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to have their area transferred to the Russian republic.

<HEAD>Are Public Service Spots Effective? The Reviews Are Mixed</HEAD>

 A fried egg sizzles and burns on the television screen as an ominous voice intones: `` This is your brain on drugs.'' Another ad depicts a medical machine recording the active brain waves of a typical 14-year-old followed by the somewhat deadened brain waves of a 14-year-old after smoking marijuana. The advertisements are brought to the screen by advertisers who have voluntarily collaborated on the efforts, and by TV networks that have provided millions of dollars worth of free air time. But do they work? Some _ including the Media-Advertising Partnership for a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its sister organization, The Advertising Council _ maintain they are effective in changing public attitudes about drug use. That position is supported by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy. Others say the ads are a waste of money. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarlais </PERSON>, an epidemiologist who works with heroin and cocaine addicts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said when the addicts do refer to the ads, it's `` derisively.'' `` They're not aimed at addicts,'' he said. `` They're aimed at people not using or casual users. The preliminary data I've seen indicate they do change some attitudes, but in terms of actually changing drug use, that remains to be seen.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Condry </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who has spent the past year at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> on the Influences of Television on Children at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, said television is delivering too many mixed messages for the ads to have an impact. <PERSON> Condry </PERSON> said he has found that the ratio of pro-drug to anti-drug messages on television was 8-to-1, including programs and advertisements showing people smoking, drinking or taking medicines. Even legitimate ads for such things as over-the-counter pain medications send the wrong message, he contended. `` While it's not illegal, what they are saying is if you do n't like the state you're in, if you have a headache, you take a drug ... take some sort of substance to change how you feel,'' Condry said `` For a child, it's not clear there's a distinction between one drug and another _ a pill's a pill,'' he said. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, said the money spent to make and broadcast the public service ads could be better spent on education. The `` Just Say No'' ad effort promoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` seems to me the kind of campaign that kids who are dealing in drugs laugh at,'' she said. `` It's not that I think these -LRB- advertisements -RRB- are damaging,'' <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said. `` What's damaging about it is that it makes the society feel we're doing something. It makes the ad industry feel it's OK to advertise the products of their clients in programs that glamorize crime in the streets, violence against women and the culture that gives rise to drug dealing. `` It's conscience money for a society that is not taking care of that part of the population that's most likely to get involved in drugs,'' she said. But <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, program director for the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, praised the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, co-director of the 1988 national survey of high school seniors that indicated a decrease in illicit drug use credited the ads with having a substantial impact. `` I personally believe the partnership's efforts played an important role in helping to bring about these changes, and the young people we survey seem to believe it as well,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> wrote to the Partnership for a Drug-Free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` They report a very high level of recalled exposure to the anti-drug advertising, a high degree of credibility in the content, and most important, a high judged impact on their own drug-using behaviors and attitudes.'' The annual <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> survey is backed by the federal government and has won acceptance over the years as the best measure of high school drug use. But it makes no pretense of measuring drug use among the 15 percent who drop out of school and are more prone to drug use. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemm </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the polling firm of <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ hired by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> to survey the anti-drug ads' impact _ said the survey found they were effective when they got a lot of air time. `` In the areas where we were able to get more exposure, we were having an impact,'' <PERSON> Clemm </PERSON> said. `` Among key groups, we were seeing changing attitudes and perceptions, changes in drug use.'' The partnership has been responsible for some 70 different TV commercials, and <PERSON> Clemm </PERSON> noted that different ads affect different groups. `` There is n't one single message that will work with every group,'' he said. Younger children, ages 9 and up, respond more to ads questioning whether the drug pushers and drug users are really such cool characters, `` the big men on campus, the people you want to be friends with,'' <PERSON> Clemm </PERSON> said, basing his remarks on interviews over two years with some 14,000 people. Older teens and college students responded to `` concern over what their younger brothers and sisters might do because of their actions'' and adults were affected by depictions of the possible impacts on their work performance, whether they might endanger others as well as themselves by taking drugs, <PERSON> Clemm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> cited the <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> study when he said in an interview that the advertising `` does work. It works not for the hard-core addict, but it does work for a person who's a casual user.'' In addition, he said, it helps prevent people from starting to use drugs, `` if you get the right ad.'' <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Venet </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of the Partnership for a Drug-Free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>'s contention that the commercials represent `` conscience money.'' `` I think these ads work,'' she said. `` I think there's a changing tone in the entire entertainment industry'' that eliminates qualms advertisers might have in supporting programs while also participating in anti-drug efforts. Among the shows she cited as making a `` conscious effort to deglamorize drug use'' were `` 21 Jump Street,'' `` Growing Pains'' and `` Family Ties.'' `` To say the industry does n't care, that's just as irresponsible as saying that we do n't have a problem,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said.

 The special relationship forged between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency will thrive under <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but on a more businesslike footing, analysts predict. That relationship is likely to be nurtured at the annual <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, beginning Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is siding with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a dispute with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has demanded that the West open negotiations with the East to reduce the number of missiles, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> want to modernize the weapons. After the summit, and a stop in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday for talks with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had made a point of meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his two terms as vice president, and following his election in November described him as a `` worthy successor'' to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> were ideological soul mates who operated on a first-name basis and with obvious personal warmth during the eight years that their conservative administrations overlapped. Things are n't likely to be as folksy with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I do n't think the chemistry's going to be there,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, faculty member of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> international </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> history </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think there's going to be less warmth there. I think there was genuine mutual admiration between <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> because they are kind of believing people,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` They believe in a cause to fight for and they admire each other for standing up and fighting ... President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, through his background, is far more a wheeler-dealer kind of character,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, predicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s relations with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will be even closer than his predecessor's because both are `` hands-on'' managers. `` I think with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a sense, she will have a more special relationship than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had,'' Price told American reporters before returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> agreed, telling <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Sky Television: `` The relationship, good as it was between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, will be at least as good, if not better, between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> based his relationship very much on personal intuition,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man who is more reflective about the conceptual matters.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from 1977-79, said personal relations between leaders has little impact on policy or decision making. But he pinpointed one factor that he said could make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s relations with the British leader different from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> actually knows about and is interested in government and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> knows about and is interested in government both at the national and international level,'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has regularly backed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ sometimes alone. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was the first to deploy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1983, and it was the only ally to support the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Despite her personal reservations, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> publicly endorsed the 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove the missiles, and in January, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, became the first <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> cruise missile base to be disarmed. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in turn, approved vital arms supplies and intelligence to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> during the 1982 Falkland Islands War against <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

 A group of ethnic Turks stoned and broke the windows of the Bulgarian consulate on Sunday to protest <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s treatment of its ethnic Turkish minority, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The agency said the stoning occurred after about 500 Turks gathered in front of the building for a protest organized by the Association for Solidarity With Balkan Turks. It said the protesters placed a black coffin and two black wreaths at the consulate gate and then began hurling stones. The protesters burned a picture of Bulgarian President <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> during the protest, which lasted about an hour, the report said. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> started an assimilation campaign in 1984 by forcing the estimated 900,000 ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones. According to the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, about 100 Turks have died in violence resulting from resistance to the assimilation campaign. The consulate phone was repeatedly busy during attempts to reach Bulgarian officials for comment. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said another group of Turks placed a black wreath at <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s consulate in the city of <LOCATION> Edirne </LOCATION>. A group of 167 ethnic Turks deported from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> Friday and four other Turks flew in from <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Saturday night.

<HEAD>$3.7 Billion Spending Bill: A Case Study in What Drives Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill to boost federal spending this year by less than 1 percent has set Democrat against Democrat and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in a classic case study of the dynamics that drive <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bloodletting has been sparked by a $ 3.7 billion domestic spending bill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved last Wednesday and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plans to debate this week. The measure is a routine one at this point in the federal fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The supplemental spending bills traditionally provide funds for agencies that find themselves needing more money for the final few months of a year. But as usual, there is more to it than that and the more has touched off skirmishing among many of the capital's power centers. The White House and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats have been feuding over the measure since shortly after March 24, when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 2.2 billion version of the bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which originates spending legislation, expanded it to a $ 4.7 billion package before slicing $ 1 billion from it last week. The $ 1 billion cut `` is not enough,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> complained to congressional leader last Wednesday. A provision supplying $ 822 million for a host of anti-drug programs has touched off battling between Democrats and Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, all of them already looking at elections next year and beyond. Aware of opinion polls showing that the public considers illegal drugs to be the nation's worst problem, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s majority <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had inserted the drug funds into the bill. This sparked a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration veto threat against the measure, arguing that there is no reason to inflate this year's federal deficit by supplementing law enforcement agencies that already have more money than they can spend The result was floor debate in which members of each party sought to embarrass the other. Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, D-Ga., described a rising `` body count'' from drugs and asked, `` How long are we going to wait until we recognize the clear call of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. But House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said the measure's drug spending was designed by Democrats `` to build a partisan record to be used against incumbents in next year's election The fighting spilled over into the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> itself. Liberals, stymied for months by bipartisan budget deals that stifled many of their priorities, were allowed to offer an amendment that would have transferred hundreds of millions of dollars from anti-missile research to drug programs. The provision was defeated 213-205 with 47 Democrats voting in opposition. One opponent, Appropriations defense subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., bolstered his case for the military's need for money for training and other programs by describing children crying at the memorial service for the victims of the fatal explosion aboard the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But the liberals got their licks in, too. They pointed out that the position of their mostly <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents was in stark contrast to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated pronouncements against what he has called `` the scourge of drugs.'' `` It is about time we put our money where our mouth is,'' taunted Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, D-N.Y. On another level, the bill has churned up the age-old struggle between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over whose pet projects get financed. The bill, which originated in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, so far contains only that chamber's version of what it says needs to be done. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have yet to be heard from, including <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who gave up his post of majority leader this year after making clear he intended to use his new job to help his home state win its share of federal <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> made his presence known two weeks ago when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> broke $ 1.2 billion for veterans out of the overall bill and into a separate measure, and sent the legislation to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The veterans' money is virtually sacrosanct politically, but <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reduced the size of the measure. The effect was to keep the agency going for awhile longer, but not until the new budget year begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> made clear that they wanted a later bill containing the rest of the veterans' money to carry with it money for projects the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considers important. Among the measures the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to seek money for is a $ 6.6 million boost to the program that subsidizes airlines servicing remote communities, and $ 75 million to rebuild a radio telescope that collapsed last winter in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also plans to strip the anti-drug money from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill as part of a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for a compromise spending package, according to congressional aides who asked to not be identified. Thus, a clash looms between <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations Chairman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., a wily veteran of congressional spending wars who has been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 48 of his 79 years `` <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> has met his match in <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>,'' one congressional aide said.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Religious Faith Has Little Impact On Sexual Behavior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 80 percent of college students say religion is important in their lives but their faith has relatively little impact on their sexual behavior and attitudes, according to a new campus survey. Half the 539 students questioned in a Gallup poll commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said they read the Bible at least occasionally and 55 percent said they had attended church or synagogue in the month preceding the survey. A full 42 percent said religion is `` very important'' to them while another 37 percent said it is somewhat important. Only 6 percent identified themselves as atheists or agnostics. Nevertheless, 69 percent of the students said they do not believe premarital sex is wrong and 56 percent said they approve of living together in trial marriages. Half said they approve of the current status of abortion rights, with 9 percent of female students saying they had had an abortion and 15 percent of the males saying their partners had had one. Responding to other questions on their own sexual practices, three quarters of the students said they had engaged in sex and half said they have had more than one partner. A quarter said they have had five or more partners. Another quarter said they were virgins. `` On the one hand, we were pleased that the majority of college students in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> find religion somewhat important,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, a senior editor at <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we were disappointed to see that even though they believe in God, their faith does n't seem to have much of an effect on their personal lives and habits, their sexual attitudes and practices.'' Gallup conducted the survey in March at 100 two-year and four-year campuses, using a sample statistically representative of college students nationwide. The margin of error is 6 percent. The survey found that religion had the most impact on the lifestyles and attitudes of the 23 percent of the students who identified themselves as evangelicals or born-again Christians. More than half of the evangelicals said they oppose premarital sex, two-thirds said they think living together before marriage is wrong, and 71 percent said they oppose abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> students, representing 29 percent of the survey, strayed furthest from the teachings of their church. The survey found that three out of four approve of premarital sex and divorce on the grounds of incompatibility; 59 percent approve of trial marriages; and 53 percent approve of abortion rights. Protestants, making up 48 percent of those surveyed, fell in the middle. The samples of Jewish students and those of other religions were too small to be analyzed separately. The survey found that evangelicals went to church and read the Bible far more frequently than any other group. `` Maybe the key to having your faith affect your personal life is to have your faith practiced with action, and also to have that community of support for morality through the church,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said. The students' broadest consensus was in opposing adultery. Asked how important it is for a married couple to have sexual relations only with each other, 92 percent said very important. `` I guess what they're saying is that it's okay to experiment a little bit before marriage but after marriage they expect their spouses to be faithful to them,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said. Poll director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezilla </PERSON> attributed the finding partially to the impact of AIDS. `` The return to the monogamous family and all is a very, very strong instinct right now,'' he said. `` If we had asked that question pre-AIDs, let's face it, there were an awful lot of one-night stands and a much more liberal atmosphere. It may be a practical matter for some -LRB- people -RRB-.'' On another issue, the survey found that 66 percent of the female students would like to be married, have children and hold a full-time job or career outside the home. The least popular option was being married with no children and no outside job _ chosen by only 1 percent. And only 9 percent of the women said they wanted to be married with children but no outside job.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told more than 300,000 religous pilgrims Sunday that upcoming parliamentary elections are the biggest step toward democracy in 45 years of communist rule. At the biggest campaign rally so far, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> urged Poles to vote in the June 4 election, the first somewhat democratic vote in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since World War II. `` Many people do n't believe. They ask, ` Are the communists giving something away? That's impossible. It is a cheat,''' he said. `` This is the best chance in 45 years to fulfill our hopes and desires.'' The opposition will vie with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates for all 100 seats in a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 161 of 460 places in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the existing parliament. The elections were set up last month after talks between Solidarity and the government. Political reforms agreed to during the talks included reinstating the Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban. Solidarity's political faction put up candidates for all available seats. Arriving on foot from the coal and steel-producing regions, the pilgrims streamed up a hillside where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> sat on an alter beside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON>. He is the second-ranking church official in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. `` Sometimes we must pray or sing together,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` It is the time for team play and not individual play. Today the team called Solidarity is playing against the team called government coalition.'' The pilgrims, who each year trek to the Piekary shrine in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, welcomed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> enthusiastically. Although the cardinal did not speak about Solidarity, he introduced <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to the crowd. The church has wide influence in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and played a key role in setting up negotiations between the opposition and the government. When Solidarity was illegal, union leaders found sanctuary in many churches.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders pondering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be under close scrutiny during their two-day meeting from another army at record strength: summit journalists. Sparks of disunity in the 16-nation alliance have drawn a throng of 1,600 reporters to cover <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 40th anniversary celebration. Last year, when <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders came here to pat each other on the back for the alliance's success, about 1,200 journalists showed up to ply the hallways and briefing rooms of the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> complex. Compared to many other summits, where world leaders meet to ceremonially rubber stamp earlier decisions, the current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit features tension, suspense and an unpredictable outcome. `` It has become a very good story,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> assignment editor <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON>. The meeting will pit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> against alliance maverick <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should open talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reduction of short-range missiles. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s open support of a new round of arms talks breaks with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense doctrine and has created a rift within the alliance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also rumored to be planning announcement of a withdrawal of some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a public relations counterpoint to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offers to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Usually `` you pretty much know what to expect'' at the outset, `` but this time the controversy makes it more complicated,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media top <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s accreditation list with 450 journalists, many traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> throughout his four-nation European tour. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks each have 40 to 50 people in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, including their anchormen. European networks have also massed in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for the summit. `` News formats are getting more similar wherever you go,'' commented British professor <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, a specialist on the media. The dozen reporters sent by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media remain an exception and their coverage is again expected to closely reflect the government line, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Glasnost has not substantially changed the way that the Soviet media report on foreign affairs,'' he said. `` There will be no debate whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government is right.'' Strong coverage of events like the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit can earn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks an edge in their ongoing ratings war. But the `` talking heads'' that dominate news conferences and briefings at such summits are unlikely to offer any footage as dramatic as a million flag-waving demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> threatening to topple the Chinese government. `` It is a problem we always face when we cover stories that involve intellectual concepts rather than ` bang-bang' footage,'' said CBS special events producer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` It is a challenge.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks went out in force to cover the protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, and some are now paying the piper. Some producers complain that equipment from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that was supposed to be forwarded to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> got held up at <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> customs. Some personnel arrived late and tired, or not at all, forcing the networks to scramble for replacements. Absent crews may not regret missing the chance to toil in the 30 trailers where film and videos are processed outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s press center. The trailers have been turned into saunas by a spell of torrid temperatures making this the hottest May of the century.

 An aging Italian war veteran stood silently in a cheering crowd at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cemetery Sunday, straining to hear President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pasquali </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> does n't speak English, but he understood the message. `` We are here to honor the men who have fallen in war,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> as he stood beside a field of white marble tombstones where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave a Memorial Day weekend speech paying tribute to Americans killed in World War II. `` I hid American and British soldiers from the Germans,'' <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> said proudly. Each of the 7,860 graves was decorated with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Italian flags and with a single pink chrysanthemum. Thousands of Italians and a handful of Americans stood on the grassy mall in front of the memorial where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. Some waved small <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Italian flags they were given at the gate. Some cheered the president they could barely see and a few wilted in the heat. They were carried to the shade by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> medics. `` I like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> simply because he is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, pulling a tattered document from his pocket. The paper signed by British Field <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> H.R </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, supreme Allied commander in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in World War II, thanked <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> for helping Allied soldiers escape or avoid capture. Not everyone in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION> shared <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>'s sentiments. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s earlier arrival at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to attend Mass was delayed briefly when about 40 right-wing demonstrators vaulted barricades and formed a human pyramid in front of the president's motorcade. None made an attempt to reach <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his limousine. Police removed them in about three minutes and took 15 to nearby <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> for questioning. The demonstrators said they belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Destra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazionale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MSI </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s neo-fascist and fourth largest political party The protesters tossed handbills that questioned whether the Allied troops that waded ashore at <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> on Jan. 22, 1944, were liberators or invaders. `` Americans would like to continue to present themselves as the only wall of defense of democratic liberties,'' the fliers said. Inside the cemetery, 25 Soviet Jews who said they had been denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas sought out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporters, asking them to call their plight to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attention. `` We were refuseniks in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and now we are refusniks in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Poljakov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. They said <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION> authorities had denied them permission to demonstrate silently along the motorcade route and wave banners urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help them get visas. Most of those in the cemetery crowd said they came just to see an American president. They began arriving hours ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brief appearance, standing in long lines to pass through metal detectors and have their handbags searched by security police The legacy of the American war dead was dramatized by the sight of three uniformed baseball teams of boys who joined the throng.

 Looking out over a gentle field of white crosses, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the story Sunday of a young soldier from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> whose heroism 45 years ago earned him the Medal of Honor and burial under the pines of <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>. The people of Sgt. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON>'s hometown, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clairsville </LOCATION>, will gather this Memorial Day at the steps of the <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> to dedicate a white granite memorial to the local hero who helped defeat fascist <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during World War II. Speaking at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cemetery where 7,860 American war dead are buried, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON> led Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Audie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the highly decorated American war hero, and his troops in a bold charge against a machine gun nest blocking the road to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. There, near <LOCATION> Cisterna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON> was cut down three times by gunfire and repeatedly struggled back to his feet, tucking his gun under a shattered arm, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` By the time he disabled the gunners, 10 enemy soldiers surrendered to this man whom their bullets could not stop,'' the president said. <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON>, the second youngest of 11 children of <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants, fell near <LOCATION> Cisterna </LOCATION> on the same day and was buried at the <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION> cemetery in a grave marked by the Medal of Honor. `` The cost of maintaining freedom is brought home to us all when tragedy strikes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, citing <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON> as an American who understood the cost of freedom. At the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clairsville </LOCATION> ceremony Monday, he said, <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, `` will be there to remember their brother _ their hero, and ours. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clairsville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON>, 76, said Sunday that he was surprised that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would mention him and his brothers in the cemetery speech in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` That's pretty special,'' he said. `` I never expected it.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said he remembered his fallen brother, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, as `` a farmer, a carpenter, a hunter ... an all-round country boy.'' After his tribute to American war dead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid a surprise visit by helicopter to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION>, which was anchored in nearby waters. `` We only had 10 minutes; we wanted to show the flag,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, when he arrived with first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president's impromptu visit was clearly a surprise for some of the <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION>'s crew. As the president and his wife headed for <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s cabin, one sailor scurried by from his morning shower wearing only a towel.

<HEAD>Alleged Sexual Assault Victim Tells Her Side of Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLEN RIDGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special education student who alleges she was sexually assaulted by several teen-age boys says she had considered them her friends, a newspaper reported Sunday. The girl, who turned 18 on Wednesday, also said she is upset that the media has portrayed her as mentally retarded, according to a copyright interview in The Record of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>. `` I thought I did trust them, mostly I did,'' she said. `` I trusted them. I knew them all my life.'' The <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office says the assault took place March 1 in the basement of the home of two teens charged in the case, 18-year-old twins <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON>. The arrests have shaken this affluent suburb 20 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Scherzers, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, 18, and two unidentified juveniles, all students at <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, were arrested last week on charges of sexually assaulting the girl with a miniature baseball bat and broomstick. Eight other male teens, including the son of a <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> police lieutenant, watched but did nothing to help the young woman, authorities said. Prosecutor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the hour-long assault occurred after the 13 youths, all acquaintances of the victim, accompanied her from a local park to the <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON> home. The twins are captains of the football team. <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> also is captain of the baseball team. The girl, whose identity has not been released, said she went to the park that afternoon and saw a group of boys, friends of hers, playing baseball. She attends special education classes at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> but plays varsity sports for <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>. After the game, she said, they asked her to go with them to the <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON> residence. `` They said, ` We want to talk to you. We wo n't hurt you,''' she said. She declined to talk about what happened in the <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON> basement, except to say that beer and drugs were not involved. She also said only three of the accused participated in the assault. `` Some of it was force, and some of it I allowed, because they would n't think I'd like them -LRB- if I did n't -RRB-,'' she said. The girl also said she was disturbed by her depiction as mentally retarded. In announcing the arrests last week, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> told reporters she was retarded. `` They're just trying to get news,'' she said. The article described her as stylishly dressed, with eyes that sparkled except when she discussed the incident. She said she does well in math and English, and in sports such as softball and basketball. She also said she gets some nasty comments from other students at West Orange High. `` They're teasing me,'' she said. `` They say, ` Oh, that's you, the girl with the broomstick and the bat.' `` It's no big deal. ... It's not bothering me.'' But she admits that she does worry about the boys who were arrested. `` I do feel bad,'' she said. `` Those were my friends. I thought I could trust them.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is planning to change the mix of airplanes and helicopters assigned to aircraft carriers, resulting in a Navy-wide loss of one full carrier's worth of aircraft, according to a congressional study. `` Although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is nominally planning to fill out and support the same number of carrier airwings as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ 13 active and two reserve airwings _ the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's total numerical requirement for carrier-capable aircraft represents the equivalent of one less airwing,'' said the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, requested the study as part of his efforts to save the F-14D jet fighter, which was cut from the 1990 budget by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> released the study Sunday evening. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s new airwing structure does n't solve the severe problem of aircraft shortfalls _ it tries to cover them up,'' <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> said. `` While I am all for moving to a standardized airwing, I believe this sudden move by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is a defense of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Cheney </ORGANIZATION> budget rather than a defense of the national interest.'' <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s four other congressmen have been fighting to restore some $ 360 million to the 1990 budget for 12 new F-14Ds. The F-14D Tomcat is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethpage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which has said it faces cutting 5,600 jobs if funding for the jet is not restored. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CRS </ORGANIZATION>'s naval analyst who prepared the study, said he learned in the course of his research that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is planning to switch in the 1990s from a combination of aircraft carrier configurations to a standardized `` transitional'' airwing. The result would be a reduction of 126 to 128 aircraft, or the number required to fill out and support an active <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> or conventional airwing, <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said. No <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman would be available to discuss airwings until Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> press office said Friday. At the end of fiscal 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> operated a combination of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, conventional, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Midway airwings. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and Conventional airwings carry 86 craft apiece; the experimental <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Midway airwings carry 76 and 66 aircraft, respectively. At the end of fiscal'88, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and naval reserves had 10 conventional airwings; two <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>, two Midways and one Roosevelt. Switching to transitional airwings would require 10 fewer F-14s than in 1988, a reduction of 2.1 percent, the study found.

 In carefully cryptic terms, the traveling <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is heralding a conciliatory message from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to counter Soviet offers and perhaps defuse <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> differences on tactical nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Sunday for the 40th anniversary <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit beginning Monday, and his spokesman said it would be th forum for a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals, many of which `` have not been presented before.'' The proposals apparently will involve some reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, on terms yet to be disclosed. In addition, there are likely to be economic gestures toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, involving a relaxation of restrictions on high-technology exports. According to White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, troop levels will be one of the issues on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agenda at the meeting with the leaders of 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself was silent on the subject, dismissing questions about a report that he plans a 10 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop reduction, as he conferred with Italian leaders and met with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. At advance Memorial Day observances on Sunday at an American cemetery in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, near the World War II landing zone at <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of the generations who have grown in peace and prosperity since that war. `` With no experience of the horror and reduction of war, it may be difficult for them to understand why we need to keep a strong military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve freedom and democracy,'' the president said. `` The answer is here, among the quiet of these graves.'' That insistence on deterrence, despite Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arms reduction offers, is another of the topics awaiting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been pressing for immediate talks on short-range nuclear missiles, most of them deployed on German soil, with ranges of 300 miles and down, meaning that they also would be used on German soil if it came to that. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does n't want those talks now, wary that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would seek to preempt the negotiations with an immediate proposal to eliminate all short-range nuclear weapons. The administration sees those weapons as an essential deterrent, offsetting Soviet superiority in conventional arms. The administration tried without success to settle that disagreement prior to <PERSON> Buh </PERSON>'s journey to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the summit. Nevertheless, the administration does not see the difference as a crisis, or an issue likely to overshadow the summit. The troop question would be a compelling issue, too. Pressure on that topic is not just international; there are growing demands in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a greater sharing of defense burdens by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies. Some reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces is guaranteed _ at least 4,000 under budget decisions already made, and almost certainly more in manpower assigned to intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which are to be eliminated under a 1987 treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. According to Pentagon testimony, that will eliminate the jobs of about 14,500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over the next 16 months. The armed forces want to keep most of those personnel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, on other assignments, but there are demands in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to bring them home. Amid all of that, the administration has indicated that some troop reduction may already have occurred routinely _ from the limit of 325,000 to the perhaps 305,000 estimated by an administration official. The official, who declined to be identified, said manpower levels fluctuate constantly. But a swing like that _ if it lasted _ would carry more than routine significance.

 The new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` school for democracy,'' is balancing in its first days on a thin edge between anarchy and old-style political manipulation. In three exhausting days played out in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, the 2,250 deputies: _ Alternately inflamed and bored colleagues with a flood of speeches more often touching on lofty principles or elementary procedure than politics; _ Refused to include many top reformers in the new full-time legislature, entrusting its duties to deputies selected by local delegations in a hazy manner; _ Forced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to answer sharp questions from little-known deputies about his privileges and policies, and to delay election of his candidate for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called the congress _ his concept for strengthening the Soviet government and making it more democratic _ a `` school of democracy'' for a nation accustomed to heavy-handed Kremlin control. A few years ago, deputies could have been jailed for saying some of the things they pronounced openly in debate. Many of the statements have taken the tone of a self-cleansing after years of forced silence. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reacted with patience and humor. He asserted his desire to be elected president before giving a policy speech but addressed touchy issues, like his government-provided country house and his holding of both the party and government leadership. Reformist historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasiev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was either `` attentively listening to the majority or skillfully manipulating it.'' Before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took a break late Saturday to resume its work Monday morning, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sought to reassure it that its disputes were normal. `` One need not panic,'' he said. `` It is all right when passions are stirring.'' The passion flared most sharply when reformers lost out in elections for the 542-member Supreme Soviet legislature. Self-styled progressives from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> proved inept in a battle of tactics, which <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> taught the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to value above nearly all else. Muscovites, alloted 29 seats on the Supreme Soviet, nevertheless put forward a list of 55 candidates for those seats. They said it was a matter of principle that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should have a choice. But reformer <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> acknowledged, `` If the list is longer than the quota, it is possible to lose some people.'' That proved to be an understatement. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used its choice to cull the reformers, among them <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who won 89 percent of the vote in March in popular elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> but did n't make the cut for the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> himself received only 806 votes from the 2,250-member congress. Reformers from the Baltic republics, more accustomed to parliamentary give-and-take, threatened to boycott the elections if choices were forced on them and engineered the election of progressive slates by putting forward only as many candidates as they had allotted seats. The delegation from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> was the only one of 15 republics that offered a choice of candidates for the new legislature's Soviet of Nationalities chamber. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> candidate <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraiko </PERSON> said reformers woke up too late to what was going on in the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> delegation, which was allotted 11 seats. `` We did not notice that there were 12 people, that there were more people than our quota, and it was clear that if our quota was exceeded, he would not be elected,'' he said. Rules and structure during the congressional session were poorly worked out, and the meeting languished for hours as deputies repeated each other or made proposals that everyone ignored. It lost its entire second day debating how to conduct elections for the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at one point declared that a `` crisis'' had developed because of an impasse over competitive balloting. He then called a recess and ignored the issue when the session resumed.

<HEAD>Corrosion To Blame For Landing Gear Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corrosion caused metal fatigue that led to the collapse of the left main landing gear on a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> 727 jet while it was being towed away from an airport gate last week, a federal investigator concluded. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the collapse on fatigue in a corroded trunnion assembly on the plane. Trunnions are the main struts that attach landing gear to airplanes. `` And so when the tug pulled the plane forward an inch or two, that was all she needed and it collapsed right there,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said Friday. There were 113 passengers and seven crew members on board the flight when the landing gear collapsed at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said the corrosion could not have been seen without taking apart the landing gear. Trunnions are scheduled for regular tear-down inspections. The one that failed Wednesday was scheduled for inspection in August 1990 and had never been taken off the 8-year-old plane, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Following the incident, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> made plans to inspect its entire fleet of 727s. Other airlines will be notified of the problem, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>At Wayside Inns, You Can Take It With You, For A Price</HEAD>

 Guests at the Wayside Inn can walk away with a lot more than ashtrays and towels _ for a price. The rooms in Wayside of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s six hotels have been decorated with antique furniture and art objects, about 90 percent of which are for sale. `` We've sold beds,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, historical curator of Wayside Properties. `` Beds are the big thing people want to take with them.'' Prices of the antiques vary. A small print costs about $ 50, a full-size walnut bed is priced at about $ 2,000 and a painting of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> sells for $ 45,000. Rooms in the Wayside Inn in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, which has been in use continously as an inn since 1797, are decorated mostly in the Colonial style. But the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> has a portrait of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and an 1860s <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> rocker </PERSON>, so-called because <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> had one like it in the White House. The wallpaper pattern in the Lincoln Room matches one used at <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s home near <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> `` People are having a lot of fun with this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` My idea was to do something so out of the ordinary you would n't have anything like it at home `` People are tickled. We had a preservation group on Wednesday. They were thrilled to death.'' Wayside owns the Hotel <PERSON> Strasburg </PERSON> and two other inns in <LOCATION> Strasburg </LOCATION>, about five miles south of <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The company also owns the <ORGANIZATION> Battletown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berryville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Larrick </PERSON>'s Tavern in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>. The inns have had few problems with theft and breakage, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` If you're going to do it like a Holiday Inn, that's what you're going to have. If you're going to have the ambiance, you ca n't worry about it.'' The project linking the inns and antiques grew from a 1985 fire that gutted the Middeltown inn. `` Nobody really knew how the inn originally was until the fire,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` It kind of offered us an opportunity to put it back.'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> began replacing the antiques and reproductions in the rooms and developing each room with its own theme. The inns, owned by antique collector <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, have long had an unofficial policy of selling furnishings. Starting in May, the practice became official with catalogued lists and set prices. Colors throughout the inns are bright, but their authenticity can be documented, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` People thought the <ORGANIZATION> Colonials </ORGANIZATION> were very very bland,'' she said. `` They were not. They loved bright colors, elaborate fabrics. It was a sign of wealth.'' `` People like to know when they come to a place like this they are living in history,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` But they do n't have to go to an outhouse.''

<TEXT>
 Just out of the shower, one sailor clad only in a towel came face-to-face Sunday with his commander-in-chief and the First Lady. The embarrassed seaman wound up as about the only man aboard the helicopter carrier <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> who did n't seek a presidential handshake. The less-than-regulation dress encounter testified to the spontaneity of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surprise visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship, anchored 2 -LCB- miles offshore in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It was set up with about 10 minutes notice, an extra Memorial Day weekend stop after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s solemn speech and wreath-laying at the World War II American cemetery in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> allied landing zone. Nearly 8,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war dead are buried beneath white crosses there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was due to return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> after the ceremony, but he had his Marine One helicopter head out to the <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> instead. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, said it was arranged on the spur of the moment when the president decided he wanted to do it. `` Surprise visit, Captain,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he returned the salute of Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, commodore of the task force that includes the helicopter ship. `` We only have about 10 minutes. I wanted to drop in and show the flag.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> got enough advance word to make it back to the ship from the memorial ceremony. A Secret Service helicopter took him in. But there was n't helicopter room for the ship's own skipper; he was left behind in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>. There was a small honor guard of sailors in dress whites, lined up for the president's arrival. Work crews on deck duty cheered him. Most of the 1,800 sailors and Marines on the <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> were below decks, so <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> poured coffee in his cabin while they assembled on deck. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s suggestion that he address the crew on closed circuit television. He wanted to shake as many hands as he could. `` We may not have time for any of this, but this is what I wanted to do,'' he told the captain. Meanwhile, sailors were racing across the flight deck to get into position for a glimpse of the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a hurried handshaking tour, lined up about 80 crew men for a photograph, then waved, thumbs up, and shouted `` Keep it up.'' After less than 20 minutes, the president and his wife were back on their helicopter, lifting off for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Census Hangs Out Help Wanted Sign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> has hung out an early `` Help Wanted'' sign knowing that staffing up for the count that begins in 11 months wo n't be easy because the temporary jobs do n't pay much and most of the people who used to take them are working full-time now. `` We will need to hire about 480,000 persons during the period October 1989 to September 1990, with about 315,000 actually working at the peak of operations,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. In some areas there simply will not be enough people, while in others the agency may be forced to hire those who are only minimally qualified because there wo n't be enough applicants to offer a choice. `` As long as the economy is good and the unemployment rate is low we will face a big problem in hiring the number of people that we need,'' explained Census spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bancroft </PERSON>. In 1790 it took just 650 people to count the nation's 3.9 million residents. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals did the job. But the rapidly escalating population required ever more workers as the decades passed: 3,231 enumerators in 1850; 52,871 in 1900 and 142,962 by 1950. This proved a major source of political patronage to the party in power in the early years, but civil service rules eventually came into play for many jobs. Housewives later became an important factor in this job force, being eager for the extra income from part-time work. That's changed now, with the majority of wives now working outside the home, they are no longer available for census jobs Indeed, in 1980 the problem became so severe that during peak operations as many as 30 percent of enumerator jobs were unfilled and many offices suffered from high turnover rates. Eventually, Census officials had to go back to the old-style political referral system in that year, asking local officials to suggest people for the jobs. That wo n't happen in 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says _ political recruiting is out. Yet in 1990, even though the majority of households will fill out their census form and mail them in, officials expect to need as many as 200,000 enumerators to visit the 30 million homes that do n't respond by mail. The remaining workers needed for the count will fill temporary office jobs tabulating, running computers and managing local and district offices. During preparation of the address lists for the 1990 count, some 28 percent of local offices reported problems in hiring sufficient staff. Turnover rates reached 60 percent in some areas, double what had been expected, according to a report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, Census officials increased their recruitment efforts and have moved to change their pay system from a uniform $ 6-per-hour rate to one based on local needs, paying up to $ 8-per-hour where necessary to be competitive with other employers. In addition, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, proposed solving a part of the hiring problem by hiring retired federal and postal workers and military officers around the nation. He has proposed legislation that would permit these retirees to accept Census jobs, on a temporary basis, without having their retirement benefits reduced as required by current law. As many as 1.5 million to 2 million people may be covered by this change, which drew wide support at a hearing called by <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. Retired federal workers are accustomed to working within a bureaucracy, are already trained in many of the skills that will be needed and often are familiar with local geography and residents, noted <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of retired Federal Employees. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> is working with state employment services offices in every state to get referrals, and is also seeking help from local governments and minority organizations. Workers will need to pass a written test and must be <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizens to work for the bureau. They should be at least 18 years old, although the bureau says that it can hire people as young as 16 if they have a high school diploma.

<HEAD>For Prosecutors, Wood Slaying is Unforgettable Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was a crime that could not be allowed to go unsolved _ a federal judge assassinated on orders from a family so rich in drug money it tried to buy its own brand of justice. Ten years ago, a single rifle bullet struck <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> in the back outside his home, just days before he was to preside over the drug conspiracy trial of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, known as `` Maximum John'' for the sentences he gave in drug cases, was the first federal judge to be killed this century. `` The slaying was a traumatic occasion for an awful lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor who worked on the Wood case and is now a <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor. `` It was an attack on the system, not just a judge, and it was a crime that had to be solved.'' Prosecutors suspected <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began meticulously putting its case together. By the time of the first indictments in April 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had conducted more than 30,000 interviews, collected more than 500,000 pieces of information and spent nearly $ 5 million. Trials and appeals pushed the tab to more than $ 11 million. In 1983, <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> was acquitted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. But he later pleaded guilty in the attempt on the life of another official and is serving a life term. Because he helped prosecutors with an unrelated case, <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> has disappeared into the anonymity of the Federal Witness Protection Program, though he remains in prison somewhere. <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON>'s wife and a man convicted of taking the Chagras' $ 250,000 to kill <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also are in prison <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> _ a now-disbarred lawyer who advised his brother to have <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> killed _ was released on parole last year and is working as a paralegal in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> was an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> rug salesman who turned to the lucrative marijuana smuggling trade in the 1960s. By the time of <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s slaying, prosecutors say, his drug empire stretched from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. He was known as a high roller who reportedly once paid off a casino debt of more than $ 900,000 in cash, and lost a $ 580,000 golf match. Prosecutors say his generosity attracted con men _ among them <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON>, who had served time on a 1968 murder-for-hire conviction. <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON> _ father of `` Cheers'' TV star <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON> _ said he went to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to dupe <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> out of $ 250,000. Prosecutors say he was a coldblooded trigger man. `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> felt he was above the system and that's why he had no compulsion for buying <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON>'s murder of Judge Wood, because as he accumulated so much wealth he believed he was bigger than our entire judicial system,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was killed. With <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON>'s testimony _ given in exchange for a plea bargain _ a jury was able to convict <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON> and his wife. <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON> was convicted of murder and conspiracy and sentenced to two consecutive life terms, plus five years in prison for obstructing justice. He has steadfastly denied any involvement in the Wood killing. His wife at the time, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON>, was convicted of perjury and obstructing justice and is serving 25 years in prison. Prosecutors say she bought the murder weapon. Mrs. <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> was convicted of conspiracy, tax fraud and obstruction of justice and sentenced to 40 years in prison. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> refused to testify against his brother. But at the same time <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagra </PERSON> was acquitted of murder in <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s death, he was convicted of possession of marijuana and obstruction of justice. And he later pleaded guilty to masterminding a plot to kill an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, who escaped a barrage of bullets just six months before and six blocks from where <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was killed. He was sentenced to life for the attempt on the prosecutor. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the judge's death, spent nearly 6 years in federal prison before being paroled in March 1988.

 Rescue workers dug through flattened buildings and searched for 150 fishermen missing after a cyclone swept through <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, killing 60 people and leaving half a million homeless. At least 27 people died and 2,000 were injured nationwide in the storm, <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, 33 people died and 500,000 were homeless, government officials said. The storm smashed into the Indian coast Friday night with winds up to 85 mph. On Saturday it veered northeast into <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> through the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, sweeping through marshy coastal areas, then continued inland. Heavy rains continued Sunday, though winds had died down. The worst-hit area was <LOCATION> Tangail </LOCATION>, 45 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. There, a roaring tornado swept away more than 2,000 flimsy houses, burying 10 people, toppling trees and downing electricity poles, <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> officials said. Five were killed in neighboring <LOCATION> Gopalpur </LOCATION> and the remaining deaths were in western districts, including <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>, where a tornado killed 1,100 people one month ago, they said. The relief officials said 150 fishermen, mostly in small boats, were missing in the <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION> area along the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, 19 people were killed and about 10,000 mud-and-straw houses collapsed in the cyclone, the state <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Sunday. Other deaths occurred in <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> state, a desperately poor region, where 450,000 were left homeless, state-run television reported. Trains, water and electricity services were disrupted along the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> coast. The government issued storm warnings a week ago after detecting a deep depression over the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. Besides last month's deadly tornado, in November, a cyclone hit <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, killing more than 1,000 people. Last summer, four-fifths of the country was submerged in moonsoon flooding that killed 1,400 people. But a three-month drought this year has withered the wheat and rice fields that feed the 110 million people.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> on Sunday insisted that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> stick to its demand for superpower talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, passed a resolution emphatically stating that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> can not exclude the possibility of eliminating short-range nuclear arsenals. The Free Democrats have made thinly veiled threats to leave Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition government if he accepts unsatisfactory compromises on those weapons at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit that begins Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is demanding early negotiations on reducing short-range nuclear arsenals, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says talks must not be held until the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> eliminates its superiority in conventional forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also wants a clear signal from <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> that he opposes complete elimination of short-range nuclear weapons and wants <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s support for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to modernize the missile fleet. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Sunday welcomed a disarmament initiative President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to announce at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, a radio station reported. American news reports have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to propose the withdrawal of about 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as an important <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> reply to disarmament initiatives launched by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pct. <ORGANIZATION> Hessischer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio reported <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal marks an `` important step forward. A Sunday newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION>, said government officials welcome <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans but also see them as a means of putting pressure on the West Germans to soften their opposition to short-range nuclear weapons. At a Free Democrats convention in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> restated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s insistence that talks begin soon on short-range nuclear weapons. `` Disarmament cnnot exclude any category of weapons,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said to loud applause from the 400 delegates. `` Why fear disarmament negotiations when they would create more security and certainly not less in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. The foreign minister said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is committed to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and to Western defense efforts. But he added, `` Just as defense capability is necessary for a lasting peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, so is cooperation, dialogue and disarmament.'' Just before <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s speech, the Free Democrats passed a resolution reaffirming a hard line on the short-range nuclear arsenals. According to the resolution, `` the elimination of all land-based nuclear short-range rockets and nuclear artillery ... can not be excluded ... if this is permitted by an improved security situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Most short-range missiles are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and their targets are in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, bowing to public pressure, faces an election next year and has been pushing hard for talks on reducing the missiles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials warn they would not be able to keep <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without the protection of the missiles.

<HEAD>West Germans Wary Over NATO Nuclear Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is becoming increasingly wary of a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense policy that could unleash nuclear weapons on German soil despite this front-line nation's strident protests. The issue goes to the heart of a current dispute within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> over whether superpower talks should be held to reduce short-range nuclear weapons. The arsenals are deployed on German territory and would be fired there in the event of war. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is pressing for early superpower negotiations on the missiles. The Unites States and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> oppose such talks until Soviet conventional superiority is reduced. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition government is also resisting a joint U.S.-British effort to replace <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s aging short-range missile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets more than triple the current range. The missile dispute is also at the core of a growing debate over just how much say <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decisions that could literally affect its existence. That debate was fueled after recent leaks about a top-secret <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercise allegedly designed to test an Alliance scenerio for using nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to stop a Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact attack. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy, the short-range weapons are a vital part of a defense known as `` flexible response,'' or the threat that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could use nuclear weapons along with conventional forces to stop a Soviet attack. The leftist-leaning news magazine <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, quoting anonymous sources, said the exercise, dubbed <ORGANIZATION> Wintex </ORGANIZATION> 89, demonstrated the potential powerlessness of non-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> powers in preventing the use of the weapons. The magazine said the West German and Turkish participants in the exercise pulled out after <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials, led by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers, ordered a theoretical atomic strike that would have destroyed large parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the western territories of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> charged that the goal of the exercise was to limit a nuclear exchange to Central and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, while buying time to negotiate an end to the conflict before a full-scale nuclear war erupted between the superpowers. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is expected to commit suicide as part of the plan,'' <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and West German officials refused to comment on details of the exercise, but confirmed that it took place in a bunker outside <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in late February and early March. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s general secretary, said it `` was a purely procedural exercise with innumerable artificial premises and not an operational scenerio for waging war.'' <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said that under <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, the decision to use nuclear weapons hinges on top-level alliance approval and the go-a-head by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. Alliance partners are later consulted as `` time and situation permits,'' the magazine said. West German fears are aggravated by a tangle of Allied treaties and post-war agreements that remain in effect more than four decades after the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. While a 1959 treaty stipulates that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can not be forced to accept the stationing of new nuclear weapons on its territory, earlier treaties remain in effect that allow the Allies _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ to routinely replace outmoded weapons. Liberals and leftists charge that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be forced to accept new nuclear weapons over its objections. The West German government, however, insists that it has the right to veto the deployment of new nuclear weapons on its soil. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> says, `` There is simply no doubt that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must first agree to accept new nuclear weapons before they are deployed.'' `` Even if a group of lawyers gets together and says that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can be legally forced to accept them, it would really be a politically unrealistic position for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to take,'' he added.

<HEAD>Waterbed Salesman Uses Reel of String to Tie Thieves to Scene of
Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Frustrated that thieves had broken into his waterbed store 20 times without getting caught, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON> tied them to the scene of the crime _ literally _ and took their pictures. He did it with the reel of nylon string which he usually ties to arrows so he can track down deer he hits when he goes bow-hunting. Instead, he tied the string to items in his store. `` I figured ... if it works good for deer and it's good enough for tracking through the woods and swamps, then it was good enough to use here,'' said <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON>, owner of a store called The Bedroom _ Your Waterbed Supermarket. He said thieves would take stolen bedding out and sell it, adding, `` They've broken about $ 3,000 worth of windows to steal $ 300 worth of bedding which they sold for about $ 30.'' A robbery May 22 was the final straw. <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON> set up two video cameras, tied string from his game tracker to several comforters and began spending the night in his store. Early Saturday thieves broke in and apparently did n't notice that they were being taped and their booty had strings attached. When they drove away from the store, the line followed. `` That reel was going 40 miles an hour,'' <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON> said. `` There was only about 10 yards left on the reel when it stopped.'' Police Lt. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said Sunday that the thieves apparently drove to the end of the block, turned right, drove two blocks, turned right again and parked. Investigators followed the string to the end of the block and around the first corner, he said. `` The string broke in that two-block stretch ...,'' he said. `` They were able to pick it up again. ... They found a car with some string hanging out of it that matched.'' Police said they believe they know who was photographed on the videotape but have not made arrests as of Sunday morning. <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON> said he hopes the incident will persuade others to stop targeting his business.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Khomeini Suffered `Heart Discomfort'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors who operated on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said Sunday he suffered `` discomfort in his heart,'' which was treated and relieved, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reported. Earlier reports said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had been operated on to stop bleeding in his digestive system. Sunday's broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, gave no more details of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s ailment but said all his bodily functions were normal and that the spiritual leader was in satisfactory condition and spending time with relatives. In a statement after Tuesday's operation, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s personal physician said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was in excellent condition and was in fact `` an exception of history.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart attack in 1986. Since then, he has rarely been seen outside his house in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s Jamaran suburb. The recent operation has stirred old confusion about how old the white-bearded revolutionary patriarch is. Much of the confusion stems from a variety of birth dates cited for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and from the difference between the length of the years observed by Moslems and by the West's Gregorian calendar. Reliable accounts in the past listed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s birth date, in Western terms, as May 17, 1900. That would make him 89. But <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Pasandideh </PERSON>, told the radical Pasdar-e <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> magazine that the revolutionary leader was born, according to the Moslem calendar, on <PERSON> Jamadi </PERSON> al-Sani 20, Hegira 1320. Moslem scholars calculate that this date translates to Sept. 23, 1902, which would make <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> 86 by Western standards. After Tuesday's surgery, the chief surgeon, Dr. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arefi </PERSON>, also put <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s age at 86.

<TEXT>
 The Turkish government, despite its ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, rejected a direct <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> request to inspect an advanced MiG-29 jet fighter flown to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> a week ago by a defector, administration officials say. The rebuff `` caused a lot of resentment'' among officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because the fighter was returned to the Russians without the type of comprehensive inspection that would shed light on Soviet capabilities, said the officials, who asked not to be named. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, scheduled an early morning meeting Monday with Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> prior to the start of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` This was a Russian front-line MiG-29, not the export version of this plane,'' explained one administration source. `` We've examined export versions, but the Soviets do n't share their top technology on the stuff they export. This was a chance to really get a look at the engines, ` look-down' radar and other systems that are loaded only on the Soviet air force planes.'' The sources said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> never offered an adequate explanation for its refusal to allow American experts to study the plane, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials assume the Turks were trying to avoid antagonizing the neighboring Soviets even though <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> reiterated Sunday what he had said at a news conference last Wednesday. `` This is an affair completely between <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> added that `` I have no knowledge of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for permission to inspect the Soviet plane.'' He did not elaborate. According to the administration sources, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was not informed of the defection _ even though the pilot has asked for asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ `` until after the Turks had already assured the Russians they could have their plane back.'' Even at that point, however, the American embassy in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> and some senior government officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` strongly and directly pressed the Turks to give us a little time to look at this plane,'' said one official. `` The embassy informed them we could get a team there to the scene without delay, But the Turks said ` No,' they would have their own experts take a look at it.'' Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> fled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on May 20, flying to the Turkish town of <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> with a bleeding arm wound. Pravda, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, later reported that <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> was working as a duty dispatcher at the Tskhakaya airfield north of <LOCATION> Batumi </LOCATION> and therefore was armed on the day of his flight. It said he shot and wounded a sentry, who fired back and wounded <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>. Two other Soviet fighters started chasing the MiG-29 but could not intercept <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> because the border was so near, Pravda said. The MiG-29, which carries the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> codename of Fulcrum, is considered the most modern and capable jet fighter currently in the Soviet inventory. The plane can fly at 2.3 times the speed of sound and according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, carries `` a true look-down-shoot-down radar, enabling it to engage low-flying aircraft or cruise missiles.'' <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> allowed <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>'s plane to be flown back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on May 21. It was stripped of rockets and weapons, which were returned on a separate plane. Two days after the defection, Turkish newspapers reported the MiG had been examined by both Turkish and American military experts before its return. One day later, on May 23, Turkish officials said the plane had been inspected by U.S.-trained officials `` who knew what to look for'' and that their findings would be shared with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` Look, we had a real opportunity here and the Turks shafted the alliance,'' said one administration source. `` It's not just the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> that's mad. Our pilots are n't the only ones who might have to fight this plane one day.'' The sources added that they were still assuming the Turks would make good on the pledge to share information gleaned from their inspection, `` but we're not expecting much.''

 Tens of thousands of protesters swarmed through a stadium parking lot on Sunday to protest the defeat of prominent reformers seeking seats in a new Soviet legislature. Demostrators shouted `` Shame!'' when a speaker mentioned President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who made the Soviet political process more open but who was partially blamed for the defeat of several reform candidates. The protest, which had official approval, came after results were announced Sunday of balloting for the 542-seat Supreme Soviet, a newly created standing legislature. The members of the full-time legislature were picked by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies from among its 2,250 members. Among the candidates defeated was <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a popular reformer and former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party chief. Rally organizer <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON> claimed more than 100,000 people filled the lot and called the protest `` the biggest political meeting ever in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' The nightly news put the crowd at 70,000. <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of siding with party bureaucrats rather than average Soviets. `` Your behavior at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the most shameful act of your political biography,'' he said before he was interrupted by loud chants of `` Shame!'' `` You have to decide who you are for, the bureaucracy or the people. You ca n't sit on two chairs,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> did not attend the rally, but his image was represented on a slew of signs and buttons. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> workers and intelligentsia! They spat in your face _ <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was n't elected!'' read one sign. The assemblage `` voted'' with a show of hands to ask another deputy to give up his Supreme Soviet seat so <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> could serve, and to notify the congress by telegram that `` By not choosing <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the congress ignored the will of 5.6 million Muscovites'' who initially elected <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to the congress by a landslide during March elections. The television news program `` Vremya'' quoted a public opinion poll that said 49 percent of the population was dissatisfied with how elections to the Supreme Soviet were run. Asked if the majority at the congress is always right, 62 percent said no. Vremya also broadcast a brief account Sunday night of the protest. Historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasiev </PERSON>, who made a blistering speech Friday criticizing the congress for being `` aggressively obedient'' and suggesting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be manipulating it, told the crowd not to despair. `` If the whole country actively expresses its will like this, we ca n't help to feel it in the Palace of Congresses in the Kremlin,'' he said, referring to the building where the congress has been meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> deputies from the 15 republics nominated candidates to represent their specific regions in the Supreme Soviet, and the congress as a whole _ which is dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members _ made the final choices for each region. Most of the regional delegations chose one candidate for each seat they were allotted. But the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> contingent, dominated by reformers, picked 55 candidates for its 29 allotted seats in the spirit of multi-candidate elections. That backfired, however, when the most prominent and popular reformers were snubbed by a majority of the congressional membership.

<HEAD>Panama's Archbishop Condemns Paramilitary Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Sunday condemned violence by paramilitary groups that `` seem to operate with official approval'' and demanded the release of political prisoners and an end to torture. Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, in his strongest criticism of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime, told about 12,000 people gathered for an outdoor Mass that the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had to speak out while `` the national life is in suspension.'' Thousands of supporters of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> interrupted the homily with applause, and at the end thousands waved white handkerchiefs and sang <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s national anthem. International observers have said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s ticket won <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s May 7 presidential race by a 3-to-1 margin, but the vote was annulled on May 10 by the Noriega-controlled government <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> stood quietly in the crowd until the end, when they were surrounded by shouting supporters as they left the muddy field where the nationally televised Mass took place. `` We're with the archbishop 100 percent,'' said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. `` He said exactly what the people think, and he touched the heart of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> rejected criticism that the church might be politicizing itself or taking sides in a political battle. The church must speak for `` all men, for truth, for justice, for fraternity. The church ... must support these values and point out the obstacles in their way.'' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said concern for people who `` hunger for God, bread, justice and fraternity'' led the Panamanian bishops' conference to release a pastoral letter two weeks ago condemning the beatings of opposition candidates and the nullification of elections. He condemned torture and `` anarchic violence by those who have been called paramilitaries even though they sometimes appear to operate with official approval.'' He called on the government and the military to allow political prisoners or those in exile to return to their families `` as a step toward the reconciliation of the Panamanian family.'' The reference to the military was an acknowledgement that the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, commanded by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, hold the balance of political power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. After the elections were annulled, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution condemning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and calling for a transfer of power as soon as possible. However, an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation sent to promote a solution to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems only succeeded in exposing the political impasse last week and failed to bring about talks between the opposition and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The Mass was nationally televised in a program that featured rare close-ups of opposition candidates and scenes of their supporters waving white handkerchiefs and singing. One of the most enthusiastic demonstrations came when the media-wise crowd spotted an American television crew on a platform. Thousands waved and chanted fervently for <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was inside thanking the archbishop for his statements.

 A Jewish settler had his hand blown off Sunday when he picked up a booby-trapped Israeli flag on which a swastika was painted. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said Jewish settlers beat up five Palestinians in reprisal. Also Sunday, Palestinian guerrillas fired rockets at the northern Israeli city of <LOCATION> Metullah </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the first such attack in a year. An 8-month-old boy suffered a cut on the neck from flying glass after one of the rockets exploded outside his house. No other damage was reported. The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, two radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions, claimed responsibility. Reacting to the claim, Foreign Ministry Spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said: `` While many countries around the world still believe that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has put an end to its terrorist activites, two factions of the terrorist organization openly compete for the responsibility of injuring an Israeli baby.'' In another development, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teenager died of a head wound he suffered in a clash with troops a week and a half ago, Arab hospital officials said. They identified him as <PERSON> Emad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelafu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zughgair </PERSON>, 18, from <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and wounded 16 Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths in four refugee camps and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed two wounded and said it was checking the other reports. Tensions mounted between the army and settlers over vigilante attacks, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> engaged in shouting matches with Jewish settlers who accuse the army of not protecting Israelis in the occupied territories. Twenty-two Israelis have died since December 1987, when Palestinians began their uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The Palestinian death toll stands at 499. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, a leading member of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the son of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, told settlers during the committee meeting, `` Blaming the army command and officers are things that can bring us down.'' The meeting was called off as tempers rose. As the commmittee members left, settlers outside shouted, `` You protect the Arabs! Why not protect us?'' Earlier, a 26-year-old Israeli from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Berakha </LOCATION> spotted an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag painted with a Nazi swastika on a road near the settlement. His hand was ripped off by an explosion when he picked up the flag, said <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON>, another settler from <LOCATION> Berakha </LOCATION>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Beilinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reported that doctors were able to reattach the hand of the victim, identified as <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said six cars full of Jewish settlers beat up five Arabs in and around the nearby village of <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION> just after the 6:30 a.m. explosion. Three people were dragged from vehicles and attacked, and two men were beaten in their homes, the reports said. The victims were treated at <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, four miles away, hospital officials said. Recently, there have been several attacks on Arabs by Jewish settlers seeking revenge for stoning and firebomb assaults on Israeli cars. Some settlers have hit soldiers who tried to prevent the revenge attacks. Arabs have charged some soldiers also assisted the settler revenge sprees, but the army denies the accusations. During a Cabinet meeting Sunday, the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, said vigilante attacks are interfering with soldiers' ability to put down the uprising. Communications Minister <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacobi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for the arrest of settlers who attack Arabs. `` They can not take the law into their own hands,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio after the Cabinet session. `` It is an action against the law.'' An army spokesman said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military commander, Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, appointed a special ombudsman to handle mounting complaints from Palestinians about misconduct by soldiers and settlers.

 A slow-moving freight train carrying fruit from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> slammed into about 30 parked railroad cars early Sunday, killing the brakeman and the conductor and injuring two other workers aboard. One of the parked rail cars was thrown into a 110-car coal train traveling in the opposite direction on an adjacent track, but no one aboard that train was injured, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Beighle </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beighle </PERSON> said it was remarkable that no one else was killed in the accident, which occurred at about 2:10 a.m. The 35-car fruit train was headed for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> at the time. `` Evidently, they thought the track was clear,'' <PERSON> Beighle </PERSON> said. `` That's still under investigation.'' `` I've never seen an engine torn up like that before in my life,'' he said. `` I've seen a lot of train crashes, but nothing like this. It looked like the front three-quarters of that engine were cut in half. I do n't see how anyone lived.'' Department of Public Safety investigators said they were told the fruit-bearing train had slowed to 20 mph as it approached <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>'s train terminal. `` Apparently somebody saw what was coming up on the tracks, but we do n't know how soon before impact they applied the brakes,'' <PERSON> Bieghle </PERSON> said. `` I see the devastating damage at 20 mph, I can only imagine what it would have been like at higher speeds,'' he added. Both trains involved were being operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, although the engines damaged in the accident were owned by <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>. State investigators and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> officials interviewed witnesses early Sunday as an investigation into the crash began. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also will investigate. The two workers who were killed were identified as <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, 44. <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON> was the train's brakeman and <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> was the conductor The train's engineer, identified only as <PERSON> R.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, was listed in critical condition Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. The other injured crew member, identified as <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zermeno </PERSON>, was in good condition at the same hospital. All were from the <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> area, authorities said. `` What was amazing to me was that another train was passing by as this accident occurred,'' <PERSON> Bieghle </PERSON> said. `` The odds are astronomical. There was n't any time lapse.'' He described the sequence of events this way: `` The first train hits the parked cars. An empty one is knocked into the cab of the other train, then back into the first engine again. That second hit is what really did damage.'' No one in the second train was even shaken up, officials said. The coal train had been heading to <LOCATION> Muleshoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. All of the parked railroad cars contained what <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> officials called a common, non-hazardous agricultural chemical, <PERSON> Beighle </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Prosecutors To File Charges Against Palme Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A regional prosecutor said Sunday he is filing charges against a Swede suspected in the 1986 slaying of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. Chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> told national radio his case against <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 42, was based on the fact that the man had been identified by several people at the murder site. He did not elaborate. Palme was gunned down from behind on Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home unguarded with his wife <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON> from a downtown movie. Speaking of the indictment, <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> said: `` pieces are missing. We do not, for instance, have the murder weapon and we do not have ... technical evidence. That, of course, is a weakness.'' The arrest of <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> last December gave an unexpected twist to the massive investigation, which had focused on an international conspiracy. The suspect is believed to have acted on his own. He has a long criminal record, which includes a manslaughter conviction, and has a history of mental illness. He has denied killing Palme. <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> declined to say how sure he was that <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was the right man, saying only `` the investigation has produced such evidence that it was our duty to hand down an indictment.'' He said observations provided by Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, who reportedly has identified <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as the killer, was an important factor in the decision to file charges. The trial, to be held in a special security hall in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s local courthouse, is scheduled to start June 5 It originally was set for May 29, but defense attorneys asked to have it postponed, saying they had not finished reading the more than 2,500-page investigation.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> canceled a visit to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Sunday and instead appealed to the captors of nine American hostages to `` let me see them.'' `` Some of my countrymen are hostages here because they wanted to help <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop said. Several Moslem leaders reacted angrily to <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s decision not to go to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and said his views of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s years of conflict would be incomplete. `` I wish that those who are holding the hostages would let me see them because I would go anywhere that a priest can go,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said during a visit to an institute for war-wounded victims in the Christian heartland northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The cardinal traveled to the facility in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shebab </LOCATION> in a bullet-proof black Cadillac escorted by four jeeps full of army commandos. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to refocus attention on the hostages, whose plight has been overshadowed by civil war fighting. The hostages are believed held in Moslem districts of the city by extremist fundamentalist groups linked with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> looked angry as he told reporters of the decision to scrap meetings with Moslem government and religious leaders. `` We're not going to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at the moment for security reasons. I am told this is not a good time for me to go,'' he said. Sources at <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> monastery, seat of <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> where <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is a guest, said the cardinal received a telephone call from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy minutes before he announced the trip cancellation. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, however, said the decision was made by <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloni </PERSON>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s representative in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It's their considered opinon that this morning I should not go to the west for security reasons. But this is not because of any discussion with our ambassador, Mr. -LRB- John -RRB- <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, or any officials in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` Whether I will still go I just do n't know,'' he added. `` I still very much would like to go over and pay those courtesy calls. But I am now subject to the recommendations of my host.'' But <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawdeh </PERSON>, told reporters the patriarch had nothing to do with the cancellation of the visit. `` The only person who mentioned security was Ambassador <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who also canceled a lunch -LRB- Sunday -RRB- in the cardinal's honor,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawdeh </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> had been scheduled to meet in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said, `` I regret to say there are those who have an interest in preventing the cardinal from listening to our views.'' He did not mention any names but said `` they portrayed the security situation to him in an exaggerated manner to make him call off the visit.'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was `` fed misleading information to prevent him from coming to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to get the Moslem views.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> overruled <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objections in coming to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for a three-day visit. He arrived Saturday. Aides said the archbishop was unaware of the Moslem criticism when he celebrated an outdoor Mass at <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the town of <LOCATION> Harisa </LOCATION>. He told about 2,000 applauding Christians, `` My reason for being here is ... I love you.'' He drew cheers when he declared that the bishops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will not turn their backs on you, not as long as I'm alive. `` The Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have never persecuted any other people. They have always wanted to live in peace with Moslems and others. The world does not understand this.'' He added, `` I will fight for your freedom.'' At least 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, are held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They include Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who disappeared in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission to free the hostages. He turns 50 on Wednesday. The longest held hostage is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The latest fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 15-year-old civil war pits army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mostly Christian troops against a Syrian-Druse alliance that outnumbers them 4-1. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> held a 90-minute meeting Sunday with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> contesting power with <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. Syrian gunners in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> blasted the coast of the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> with sporadic shellfire, maintaining a blockade against the area's 1 million inhabitants. Police said there were no casualties. At least 359 people have been killed and 1,396 wounded since the fighting and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared on March 8 a `` war of liberation'' against the Syrian troops. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, under a peackeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, sent troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> voiced sympathy for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s cause. `` You ca n't do anything when you have occupying armies and when you have shells coming in,'' he told reporters.

<HEAD>Government Conservatives Establish Censorship Committee</HEAD>

 In another move to suppress the demonstrations demanding greater freedom, conservatives who have gained the upper hand in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s power struggle have created a censorship committee, sources said Sunday. One of the key demands of tens of thousands of students who have occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central Tiananmen Square has been a free press. For several days during the rallies and marches, the closely watched <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news media reported the events with a freedom unprecedented in the 40 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. Thousands of journalists participated in some of the marches and signed petitions calling for a free press. Diplomatic and government sources said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and other hardliners estalished a five-member group with broad powers to stop the dissemination of information considered harmful to the conservative cayse. They said the group was formed Tuesday following the imposition of martial law on May 20. Since then the news media has been dominated with reports supporting the crackdown. A liberal newspaper in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, has been stopped from printing its last two issues. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, security forces were posted at such major news outlets as the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the central radio and television stations. The sources said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was furious last Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s newspaper, published a front-page article saying martial law could not solve political problems On the same day the paper published a photograph of hundreds of people blocking what appeared to be a tear-gas equipped vehicle from entering <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The picture of a vehicle that could be used to scatter demonstrators was significant because the government had said martial law was not intended to suppress the student movement. The People's Daily printed a front-page story Sunday saying the vehicle was a truck `` used to carry anti-aircraft weapons for the air force.'' Last week, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s rival and the moderate head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly was stripped of power for expressing support of the student movement. The sources said <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, who belonged to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s faction and was the Politburo member in charge of superiving the media, also was removed from positions of authority. They said the censorship committee will assume some of Hu's functions The sources said the five committee members, all known for their conservative views, are <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Renzhi </PERSON>, head of the party's propaganda department; chief government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>; He <PERSON> Dongchang </PERSON>, vice minister of the education commission; <PERSON> Zeng </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianhui </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy president, and <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Weijun </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> city information department Yuan is the best known of the group. During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution he was closely associated with the `` Gang of Four,'' who ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the movement's last years. But he survived the gang's purge, earning the nickname `` foxy,'' a reference to his ability to weather political changes. Some Chinese journalists said formation of the committee signals a new `` winter'' for the media. `` For three days we were in the sun,'' said one. `` Now we are waiting for a thunderstorm.'' Reporters at leading media outlets said they are being told to write `` reports'' detailing their activities during the movement. The reports could be used later as evidence against them, they said. Still, they said no punishment will be able to wipe out the successes of mid-May. On May 17-19, papers throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were filled with articles on the student movement, some even urging the government to give in to some of the student demands. `` Those days taught us that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> can report the truth, something we thought only Westerners could do,'' said one reporter. `` We also realized that people will read newspapers if they are truthful. Seeing my articles pasted on the walls of buildings all over town was such an encouragement.''

<HEAD>Veterans Get Bronze Stars 45 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPARTA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 150 military veterans were awarded the Bronze Star in a Memorial Day weekend ceremony that honored them _ 45 years after the fact _ for service during World War II. `` Since we all got through it and we're still living, I am very proud to be here today for this award,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, 69, said after he and his brothers <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> received medals at Saturday's ceremony. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, an infantryman in the war, said he was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded near the Maginot Line in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in late 1944. But he had never been given the Bronze Star.

 Israeli troops on Sunday killed two Palestinian guerrillas in a shootout in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said. He said the guerrillas were on their way to attack a northern Israeli settlement. Israel-backed Lebanese militiamen also wounded and captured two gunmen in the shootout in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone,'' the spokesman said. No Israeli troops or militiamen from the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were injured in the firefight, said the spokesman, who under regulations can not be named. Also Sunday, several Katyusha rockets were fired from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into the Israeli border town of <LOCATION> Metullah </LOCATION>, slightly injuring an 8-month-old boy. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Talaat </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakoub </PERSON> claimed responsibility for both attacks. The <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> clash began before dawn Sunday, as a joint Israeli army and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> force spotted four armed men north of the village of <LOCATION> Khaim </LOCATION>, two miles north of <LOCATION> Metullah </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Defense Forces -RRB- immediately opened fire, killing two terrorists,'' the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established its security zone, a six-to-10 mile-wide strip along the border, in 1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Foreign reports indicate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has almost 1,000 troops in the zone, which also is atrolled by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The army spokesman said the gunmen carried Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifles, an RPG grenade launcher, two American-made LAW anti-tank rockets, wirecutters and explosives. The spokesman said the explosives and wirecutters showed the guerrillas intended to cross the Israeli border and carry out attacks. `` A preliminary investigation established that the terrorists intended to carry out an attack on a northern settlement to kill Israelis,'' he said. An eyewitness said the guerrillas who were killed carried white plastic bags filled with plastic explosives made in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and wore red headbands. On the headbands were written <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> -LRB- Arabic for God is Great -RRB- as well as slogans in <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> -LRB- Persian -RRB-. The army spokesman said the military was investigating the report.

<HEAD>Free Presbyterian Church Splits After Chancellor Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dissenting group has broken away from the church that disciplined <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s lord chancellor for attending <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION>, one of its ministers said Sunday. The small Free Presbyterian Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last week rejected an appeal by <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> of <PERSON> Clashfern </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chief legal officer, against his suspension as an elder of the church. <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, 61, then announced he would leave the church rather than accede to its demand he not attend <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> funeral Mass, as he had done twice in honor of fellow peers. The church regards the Roman Catholic faith as a perversion of Christianity. On Sunday, the Rev. <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said from his pulpit in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> that a `` dissenting minority'' of the church had broken away. Supporters of the breakaway movement formed the new Presbytery of the Associated Presbyterian Churches in <LOCATION> Inverness </LOCATION> on Saturday. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> issued a statement saying: `` The synod, by a majority, has made pronouncements and reached decisions which violate the constitution of the church. `` In many cases these have been irregular and have denied the rights of individual Christians. I and others find in conscience that we can not remain, and we have therefore separated from the church. `` We constitute a dissenting minority claiming to adhere to the doctrine and constitution of the church.'' The statement `` reserved the right'' of ministers and elders to exercise the functions of their offices for those church member who join the new group. It said there would be `` implications for church property'' _ indicating the possibility of disputes over the control of church assets. The Free Presbyterian Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> claims a membership of 7,000, including overseas members, but the number of regular worshipers in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> is thought to be about 3,000. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> would not estimate how many members the new group might attract or say if <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> might be among them. `` He -LRB- Mackay -RRB- is n't involved,'' the minister said. `` I do n't want to be seen to speculate on him and I think he needs a good rest and a bit of peace and quiet after all this business.

<HEAD>DOE Fusion Panel Cancels Visit To Utah Researchers' Lab</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An Energy Department panel evaluating cold fusion experiments canceled a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> after researcher <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> bristled at the committee's composition, a newspaper said Sunday. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> demanded that the panel be changed, either by dismissing members he feels are hostile to his research or by adding friendly ones, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Deseret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` I see this visit as a waste of valuable time, since many of these panel members have already clearly stated their positions,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I feel there is little one can say to a hostile person that will change his mind.'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said he and co-researcher <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, a British colleague from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, think the panel was `` organized in a manner that can only lead to a negative and non-objective report'' on fusion research. On March 23, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> announced they had achieved room-temperature, or cold, fusion using rods of palladium inside coils of electrically charged platinum immersed in heavy water. Heavy water is water made with an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said the energy generated by their experiment was up to 100 times that needed to produce the reaction. Scores of laboratories have attempted to duplicated the experiment, but few report similar results and proof of nuclear fusion remains elusive. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> have been particularly criticized by physicists, who contend the reaction may be a chemical reaction, not fusion. A co-chairman of the 20-member <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> committee, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> nuclear chemistry professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huizenga </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the panel's visit, scheduled for Wednesday, was being canceled. In a telephone interview Sunday, <PERSON> Huizenga </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the reasons for the cancellation were `` rather complex,'' but acknowledged that <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' concerns over the panel's makeup were a factor <PERSON> Huizenga </PERSON> said several committee members also had Memorial Day-related commitments that conflicted with the trip. Whether the committee reschedules the visit depends on several factors, including <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s concerns about its composition, <PERSON> Huizenga </PERSON> said. He declined to give further details, but said he would like to visit the university at some point. The committee has also planned visits to <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which have duplicated parts of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said Saturday that the panel included several scientists who have expressed disbelief at his fusion claims, and therefore do not have the impartiality desired in such a review committee. `` It is disappointing that the committee is composed of so many members who have previously stated their very negative position in the press regarding this research,'' he said. He said the most notable of those were <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> fellow <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Koonin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrighton </PERSON>, head of the chemistry department of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said he was disappointed that the committee, instead of negotiating, canceled the visit. He said he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> would continue to only allow `` reputable, sincere scientific collaborators'' into their labs. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, a professor of chemistry, said he is even more convinced that he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> have tapped fusion. `` The newest results are very strong and indeed confirm and surpass our earlier results,'' he said. `` These data and their analysis will be published later this summer in scientific literature.''

 A group of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veterans and former U-boat crewmen spent the Memorial Day weekend remembering a part of history they shared 45 years ago: the capture of the only German submarine during World War II. They gathered Sunday to rededicate the newly renovated sub to the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, where it has been on display for 35 years. `` They lost and we won, but we've become very good friends,'' retired Adm. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Trosino </PERSON>, who lead the boarding party during the capture, told the crowd of about 150 veterans and their families. They honored those veterans on both sides who have died since the war. `` Many of the men in this engagement, both American and German, have been transferred to another realm by our supreme commander, but we must remember them and honor them, for they will always be a part of us,'' he said. The U-505 submarine was captured June 4, 1944, two days before D-Day, off the coast of west <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The capture was significant because it enabled the Allies to break the German radio code. The sub had sunk eight Allied ships in the three previous years. The sub is one the most popular attractions at the museum on the city's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. Tours cost $ 2.50 for adults and $ 2 for children and senior citizens. Admission to the museum is free. Most of the group gathered for the Memorial Day weekend were sailors assigned to the ships that surrounded the submarine as it was towed to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. But two of the captured <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> sailors flew in from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the occasion, and a third, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobeler </PERSON>, traveled from nearby <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.. <PERSON> Gobeler </PERSON>, 65, recalled with a thick accent the last day he served as petty officer on board the submarine `` We got chased a couple of days ... and that morning we were feeling safe,'' he said. `` We heard the sonar noise, and went up the periscope, and saw we were surrounded by a unit of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships dropped depth charges, and forced the craft to surrender. `` After we got the depth charge, I saw the ship jumping up,'' he said. `` I thought it would break,'' said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, who came to the ceremony from his home in southern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. He was 19 when he was the sub's helmsman. <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said he is happy to have become friends with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crewmen since the war ended.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 5,000 opposition supporters marched Sunday through this town known nationwide for toughness, kicking off the 1990 electoral campaign with the first united opposition march. `` Democracy Yes, <LOCATION> Sandinismo </LOCATION> No,'' the crowd chanted as it snaked through town for more than two hours. No uniformed police were in sight during the march, the largest show of opposition to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government this year, and no violence was reported. `` Only with unity can we defeat the Sandinista regime,'' said one of the speakers, <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The sea of flags, posters and banners representing labor unions and 15 opposition parties flowed through <PERSON> Monimbo </PERSON>, a neighborhood so feisty that even the dreaded National Guard of ousted dictator <PERSON> Anastio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> was afraid to enter. <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON>, 17 miles southeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, was crucial to the popular revolution that finally replaced <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> on July 19, 1979. `` <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> was the tomb of Somocism, it will be the tomb of Sandinism,'' people chanted. The united opposition, which spans the political spectrum from left to right, took pains to distance itself from the anti-government rebels known as the Contras. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, the only woman on the political directorate of the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel leadership, gave her speech after the rally was officially pronounced over. Supporters of her <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gathered separately from the march. When Ms. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> returned from exile Friday night, she signed a document renouncing support of armed struggle against the Nicaraguan government. She was the first member of the rebel directorate to do so. All Nicaraguan exiles who return must sign the document. The general elections are scheduled for Feb. 25, 1990. They were moved up 10 months by Presiident <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as part of an agreement reached with the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> at a summit in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> Feb. 14. Pledging free campaigns and balloting, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised electoral and other reforms that have since been enacted by the Sandinista-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition claims the reforms are merely cosmetic and leave the electoral process under Sandinista control. But <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said last week the Sandinistas would make `` no more concessions'' to the opposition.

 A retired <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineer who predicted that the beginning of the end of the world would occur in 1988 now says his forecast was off by one year. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said born-again Christians will be taken up into heaven Sept. 1 in the `` rapture.'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, 56, created a stir last year with the publication of `` 88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Be in 1988.'' He estimated that he and the World Bible Society here gave away or sold about 4.5 million copies of the booklet. `` The Final Shout-Rapture'89 Report'' is to be released this week, said <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, who co-wrote the booklet with <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>. `` I made a mistake last year. My calculations were off by one year,'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said in a telephone interview last week from his <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, home. The mistake occurred, he said, because present-day Gregorian calendars count only 99 years for the first century; calculations begin at 1 A.D., not zero. `` But I believe my mistake was God's will _ a shout, a preparation period for the church. And there has been a revival. I believe this year it's the rapture,'' he said. `` The evidence is there.'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, who lives on his pension from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said he has dedicated his life to trying to unlock the Bible's riddles about the rapture. `` I've spent $ 50,000 of my own money to get the word out about this,'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said. `` I've never made a cent on it. I've put 152,000 miles on my <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION> and all I own is a bed. When you fear God enough, you do n't lie, cheat or steal.'' In the new booklet, he said he `` is not a prophet, and such studies are subject to error.'' The World Bible Society, which had revenues of $ 3.1 million in 1987, made an estimated $ 200,000 on the controversial booklet, but it was given to Christian charities, said society head <ORGANIZATION> Norvell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> said he plans to send out 300,000 free copies to <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> ministers nationwide before selling them for $ 2 a copy in Christian bookstores.

The <LOCATION> Washburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office said the fugitives were still in jail uniforms and were shoeless when they surrendered without resistance to policeman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Esser </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Spooner </LOCATION>, about six miles north of the jail. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, 18, of rural <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Trego </LOCATION> were discovered missing Saturday morning, said Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. They had used hacksaw blades to cut through the bars of a jail window, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. York faces an Oct. 2 trial in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges that he murdered his parents last September after overhearing them talk about enrolling him in a drug counseling program. The sheriff's office said <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON> police were notified someone had seen two young men fitting the fugitives' descriptions. They were found about 1:30 p.m. behind a bottling plant and were taken to <LOCATION> Burnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Grantsburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> York </PERSON> was later transferred to Douglas County Jail in Superior. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said law enforcement agencies throughout <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and in neighboring states had been alerted to the jail break. `` All they had on was jail coveralls and small sandals _ almost barefoot,'' the sheriff said. York and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had been cellmates since May 13, when <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was jailed on a burglary charge and for probation violation, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said.

 The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic, and the muddy <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> coughed up burned and bloated bodies for weeks afterward. But until Sunday, no memorial had been created in this onetime Confederate stronghold for the Union soldiers who perished aboard the steamship, many of them emaciated survivors of Confederate prison camps during the Civil War. Before a small crowd of about 50 people, a 6-foot granite marker was unveiled in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Elmwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> as a reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the city's downtown riverfront Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the paddlewheeler was carrying more than 2,300 people, in addition to 100 horses and mules, when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865, less than three weeks after the end of the war. Most of the more than 1,500 people who died had recently been freed from prison camps in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and were headed north to be released from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Many were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheeler's 18-foot boilers, one of which had developed a leak and been hastily repaired. When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper decks collapsed, forming a funnel that dumped dozens of the victims into the fire, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON>, a forensic pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> lawyer who has researched the disaster for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport payments. `` There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> estimated the Sultana death toll at 1,547. By comparison, 1,503 lives were lost when the ocean liner Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the remote <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in 1912. Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between 1,400 and 1,450, but <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said those estimates failed to include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded the boat at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. `` Our figure is probably a conservative one,'' <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said. The Sultana monument, financed by three <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> residents, will be the second of two major markers to the disaster. The other, in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was put up in 1916 by <PERSON> Sultana </PERSON> survivors who raised money for the monument themselves. Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> two weeks earlier and with the end of the war, <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said. `` It was just lost to history because of the other events that were going on at the time,'' <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said.

 A student activist group early Monday urged students over loudspeakers to maintain their occupation of Tiananmen Square until June 20, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature is set to discuss the democracy movement. The announcement came a day after about 80,000 students from throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> marched in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to recharge their campaign for a freer society with less corruption. They also demanded the fall of conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who declared martial law in the city May 20 to suppress the movement. `` We can not leave the square,'' student loudspeakers blared. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suppresses us we will become an exemplary model for all future movements to come.'' The announcers, who said they were from a leadership group, claimed 30,000 students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> remained on the increasingly dirty, foul-smelling square. The numbers were inflated. The announcement further confused the question of who is leading the student movement. Activists from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> proposed Saturday that the occupation end Tuesday and that the students concentrate on propaganda work, informing the masses of the movement's goals. Thousands of students are returning to their home provinces daily to spread the word. But many of the largely out-of-town students remaining in the square say they will refuse to go. Students from most of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 31 provinces paraded through the narrow streets of the capital's old quarters Sunday. `` We'll keep coming until <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> steps down,'' the marchers chanted. `` <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> is a big political thug,'' said a student from coastal <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province. Also Sunday, sources said government hardliners formed a censorship group to assert more control of the increasingly independent state-run media, which have been largely sympathetic to student demands. Another 30,000 students marched against <PERSON> Li </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, with one banner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap. Thousands of Chinese also marched in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, to show solidarity. Unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to 1 million people, there were few non-students in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> march. `` Factories are now taking economic measures against workers who participate,'' one student leader said. But large crowds of residents continued to applaud protesters and to gather around university gates, reading student posters and listening to student broadcasts. Hardliners led by <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who is believed to be acting for senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, reportedly have placed moderate Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> under house arrest and removed him from his post. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had expressed sympathy for the students, whose demands included talks with the government on a freer society and an end to corruption and profiteering by officials. Martial law was declared in response to the student occupation of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, which entered its 16th day Sunday. About 10,000 students remain in the 100-acre square, down from a peak of about 200,000. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> activists have proposed that the occupation end Tuesday and that the students concentrate on informing the masses of the movement's goals. Thousands of students are returning to their home provinces daily. But many of the students they will stay, at least until June 20, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature is expected to meet. `` We will not leave ... We have n't achieved our goals,'' said <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangfu </PERSON>, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Jiangsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops were rushed to the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to enforce martial law but were prevented from entering the city by throngs of residents. Soldiers have retreated to nearby camps and roads have cleared. One Western analyst said about 200,000 troops have been sent to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but he believes such large numbers were called in as part of the leadership power struggle, not merely to suppress students. Official media continued to report support for the martial law decree, with nationwide television saying the country's largest union was behind the move, even though many of its members marched with the students. In another step to end the protest, the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` fully affirmed -LRB- the students' -RRB- patriotic enthusiasm and will not investigate and punish those students who have voiced and committed extremist words and acts,'' the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. A party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting is expected to be convened soon to approve the reported purge of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. Sources said the conservatives still may be determining what accusations to make publicly against the party leader. A document circulated among high-level party members accuses <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of forming an anti-party coalition and using the student movement to seize power, one diplomatic source said. But another document distributed to lower-level officials is less harsh, saying <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> betrayed the party and revolution, helped incite the demonstrations and tried to split the army, the source said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>, party propaganda chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, and Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON> are believed included in a purge, the scope of which remains unclear. Many analysts feel that after <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s purge, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> may be next to fall because of his unpopularity.

 Thousands of police raided two universities Sunday to stop teachers from organizing a union in defiance of the law and officials reported 1,081 teachers and students were arrested. A force of about 4,500 riot police surrounded <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where teachers were meeting to organize their first union in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, according to police. They said some 700 officers moved in to the university and arrested about 250 teachers. Hundreds of teachers barred from entering <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> then gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to hold a rally and when police went there they were barred by students who formed human barricades. Police officials said most of the teachers at the <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> rally were arrested along with some students. The officials said virtually all of the detainees were released after signing statements that they would not join or support the planned union but five people remained under arrest. Police did not say how many of those arrested were teachers and how many were students. The government has banned teachers' unions on grounds that teachers as civil servants can not form trade unions. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, which claims a membership of 70,000, sought to organize a union.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived Sunday for the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit prepared to respond to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arms reduction proposals, as the Western alliance seeks common ground in the changing landscape of East-West relations. The two-day summit that begins Monday marks the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> but a dispute over the alliance's own short-range nuclear missiles threatened to undermine the unity celebrations. Still, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials said they would not let the missile dispute overshadow what they described as the real task of the summit leaders _ planning their strategy to deal with the enormous changes under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is at once ready to assure a common defense and to reduce arms,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he set the tone for his meeting with allied leaders. Possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiatives included proposals to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and drop a ban on high-technology exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Monday's editions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a confidential letter to other western leaders late last week, had proposed that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> offer a cut of about 30,000 American troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as part of a plan to reduce non-nuclear forces. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Sunday evening that some of the allies had been briefed on the substance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals, but he declined to provide details of the initiatives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on his arrival in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, that he looked forward to the time the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be welcomed as a `` constructive partner,'' but he also stressed the need to maintain <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defenses and the security of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained at loggerheads with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s demand for early superpower talks to reduce short-range nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says those weapons will remain essential until the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's superiority in conventional forces is reduced. But West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> insisted Sunday at a German political rally that `` Disarmament can not exclude any kind of weapons.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who arrived here Sunday night, said the British prime minister `` can not contemplate'' negotiations to reduce short-range nuclear missiles `` unless and until conventional force reductions have been agreed and they're being tangibly implemented. The British spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was possible no deal would be reached at the summit. `` We are n't in the business of a bad agreement We are in the business of retaining flexible defense,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where he closed out a two-day visit with an emotional Memorial Day weekend tribute to Americans slain in a 1944 assault on fascist <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cemetery in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, which holds the remains of nearly 8,000 soldiers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said their deaths demonstrated `` why we need to keep a strong military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve freedom and democracy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> highlighted the story of war hero <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON>, a young soldier from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> who won the Medal of Honor for single-handedly capturing an enemy machine-gun nest despite being hit three times by gunfire. <PERSON> Antolak </PERSON>, who is buried in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, knew `` the cost of maintaining freedom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Earlier, some two dozen right-wing demonstrators had delayed the presidential motorcade for about three minutes, hurling a blizzard of flyers questioning whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in World War II were liberators or invaders. A handful were arrested. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted at <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by Belgian Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>. `` We want to see an end to the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the president said, but he also called on the East to adopt `` Western values'' as a way of bringing the two sides closer together. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> called for `` seizing the opportunities to improve the conditions of peace while taking care not to jeopardize security.'' White House officials, declining to be identified, said whatever actions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might take on the 305,000 to 324,000 troops in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would be framed as a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms reduction talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` Whatever he proposes will be done in the context of submitting suggestions for alliance consideration,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders would mean a 10 percent overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop cut, including a 20 percent cut in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> combat troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The president's plan would require the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to cut more of its troops in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has proposed thus far, the Times said. The paper said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also proposed that the West accept the Soviet contention that aircraft in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be part of a conventional arms pact. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested an acceleration of efforts to negotiate a treaty and expressed hope an agreement would be reached within a year and implemented by 1992 or 1993, the Times said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also acknowledged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s interest in reducing the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> short-range nuclear weapons on its soil, but they said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in no hurry to pursue talks with the Soviets on that issue. In an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> interview from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` the president has already acknowledged at least the principle of negotiations, although he feels very, very strongly that before you can talk about that or get into that, you need to see a conventional forces agreement'' with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. But <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> on Sunday threatened that his <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would withdraw from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s coalition government if Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> adopted the American stance. Facing such political pressure at home, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> warned on Saturday against delay in addressing the missile issue. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Sunday that `` The situation is unchanged. We continue to discuss it.'' White House officials, meanwhile, indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now ready to have <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> negotiate directly with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on troop levels. The comprehensive Western arms reduction proposal tabled in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in March called for indirect manpower cuts through withdrawal of equipment and consequently the troops needed to operate it. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this month offered a 1.26 million cutback in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troops as part of an overall reduction in forces to reach equal ceilings of 1.35 million for the two alliances. An American initiative to reduce troops might blunt disarmament tendencies within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and allow the Western leaders to paper over the missile issue with an ambiguous communique at the windup of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> summit on Tuesday. Pressure has been building on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced late last year that the Soviets would withdraw 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops from Central and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and cut Soviet forces by 500,000 overall.

 Hundreds of thousands of people marched through central <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Sunday to show support for the Chinese students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> demanding more democracy and changes in the Communist government and party. It was believed to be the largest demonstration ever held in this British colony with a population of 5.7 million. Organizers estimated the number of marchers at 1.5 million. Police placed the figure at around 500,000. Parents with babies, students, housewives, elderly citizens and merchants joined in the six-mile march in response to a call by the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students for demonstrations throughout the world to back their demands for democratic reforms. Chanting `` Long live democracy!'' and `` Support <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students!'' the throngs began the march in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, walked to North Point and then started back to the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, ending the rally at <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Marchers filled half of the roads along the route and vans, buses and cars in the remaining lanes were adorned with posters backing the marchers and the drivers honked the horns. Waiters at a restaurant displayed a sign saying `` Keep Up the Good Work!'' `` We live in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. We are used to freedom but the students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have to fight for it. We have to help them,'' said So Kwok-poon, a jewelry merchant. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is scheduled to be returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities have promised to preserve <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist system for 50 years under a `` one country, two system'' When the first group of marchers finished the hike two hours after setting out hundreds of thousands of people were still waiting at the starting point to begin. The march began at 2 p.m. and ended about eight hours later. <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sau-mei </PERSON> said she and her three children waited for four hours before they could join the huge procession. `` It is a big time.

 Four teen-agers aboard a 14-foot motorboat were killed when a 38-foot racing boat rammed them on the Intracoastal Waterway, authorities said Sunday. A witness to Saturday's accident said the larger boat accelerated as it cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>, hit the side of the 14-foot boat carrying five people, then continued on over the top of it. `` It sounded like plastic breaking _ a lot of it,'' said bridge tender A.J.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protests came as about 80,000 students marched in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to recharge the pro-Democracy movement, which is threatened by a government power struggle that has left hardliners in charge. Recent reports indicate that students may end their two-week occupation of Tiananmen Square. About 1,500 people, most of them Chinese students, demonstrated in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and about 1,200 marched to the Chinese Consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is host to about 40,000 students from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and similar demonstrations have erupted in cities and universities around the country. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the students gathered near the Chinese Consulate downtown, and marched around the block for an hour, chanting `` Get rid of dictators.'' They moved on to <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where they burned effigies of Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader. The pro-Democracy movement is seeking the resignations of the two men. After the protest ended, about three dozen natives of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> remained for a 24-hour strike. They sat on the grass near a statue of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, and sang songs they said were written by protesters in their homeland. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, demonstrators marched from Dag Hammerskjold Plaza near the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> to the Chinese Consulate on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. They carried signs reading `` Down With Chinese <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. We Want Democracy'' and `` Down With <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>.'' `` I'm afraid that the fight for democracy will be even harder because the hardliners will move with a firmer hand,'' said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chak </PERSON>, a 20-year-old native of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> who is a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` Though they are not supported by the people, they will maintain the power for a while,'' said <PERSON> Yukkong </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>, 31-year-old <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> native who is a doctor at <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` But I think in a year or two the hardliners will have to step down. `` The Chinese are aware now, they wo n't keep silent,'' said <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>.

Crisis is the word most often used to describe conditions in the schools. `` And yet what I saw of teaching convinced me that it can be an exhilarating job.''
