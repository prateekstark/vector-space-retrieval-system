 Park rangers and volunteers searched the summit of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> on Friday for a missing climber whose partner was found dead just below the summit, <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Park spokesman <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said helicopters ferried four groups of ground searchers to the mountain, but found no sign of the missing man. A helicopter also was flying around the 14,410-foot peak as part of the search. The two men were in a party of four men aged between 26 and 33, all from the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. The other two men notified authorities Thursday that one of their companions had died and the other was missing. The names of the four have not been released. <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said not all relatives of the dead and missing men had been notified as of Friday afternoon. In all, about 21 people were involved in the search. A commercial helicopter was en route Friday to pick up the dead man's body, which was found Thursday evening about 400 feet below below Liberty Cap, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION>, at 14,410 feet, is the mountain's highest point, while Liberty Cap, on the northwest side, is at 14,112 feet. The third summit, Point Success, is at 14,158 feet. <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said the man probably died of hypothermia since he had taken off his parka earlier and tied it to his skis. The parka was still tied to the skis when he was found. The survivors searched the summit area and searched the eastern side of the peak for the missing man before descending to the <LOCATION> Ipsut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> campground to report the death Thursday. The four climbers, all of whom had skis to use on the descent down the mountain's glaciers, started their ascent Sunday morning, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is spending $ 6 billion to rebuild this city at almost head-spinning speed, turning a town left virtually demolished by the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s most beautiful and elegant city.'' Workers have built bridges, replaced buildings, fixed roads, added new water and electricity systems and have even begun replacing palm trees decapitated by artillery fire. Officials plan to erect almost 100 statues of war heroes, with their fingers pointing forbiddingly in the direction of neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` What we are doing can not be compared with the sacrifices of thousands of brave men who lost their lives in defending <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>,'' said engineer <PERSON> Nawaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> as he supervised a street repaving in downtown <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in February imposed a three-month deadline for completing reconstruction of this strategic city overlooking the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The deadline was to end May 12, but Gov. <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sa'eed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadithi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the renovation has been extended to June 12 to cover more of the city and encompass new projects. At least 90 percent of the buildings in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> were destroyed or damaged in fierce Iranian artillery barrages during the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iranian troops reached within six miles of the city last spring before being driven back, and Iraqis consider the city a symbol of their defense. After the August cease-fire, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government announced it would rebuild <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, and so far said it has committed $ 6 billion to the project. <PERSON> Hadithi </PERSON> said six small rivers in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> had been cleared of debris, their banks resurfaced and 40 bridges constructed. A new electricity grid and new pipe network for drinking water have been installed. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> authorities have said they will build a new drinking water processing plant in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> that will tap water from the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nasrriya </LOCATION>, 75 miles north. Residents consider the current water from the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> too brackish. <PERSON> Hadithi </PERSON> said the government offered unlimited money to finance the development plans so <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> can be `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s most beautiful and elegant city.'' But the city still bears scars from the shelling, including shrapnel holes in buildings. <PERSON> Hadithi </PERSON> said the city, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second-largest after <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, is back to its prewar population of 1.5 million. An estimated half the population fled during the shelling. The government has encouraged people to return by offering plots of land, cash gifts and loans or grants of up to $ 32,000 to build new homes. The government also is offering similar incentives to get people with no <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> roots to move into the city. Among the projects is the construction of 96 statues of senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officers killed while defending the city. The statues will be erected on the corniche of the Shatt <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> with their arms pointing east, toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` warning against the dangers which have always come from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the governor said. The government did not use independent contractors for the reconstruction drive, relying its own men and machinery to do the work. At least 100,000 workers and 40,000 machines from different parts of the country were dispatched to take part in the project, called `` The national drive for the reconstruction of the city of cities.'' <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> has as much strategic as symbolic importance to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists a 1975 treaty that places the countries' southern border in the middle of the <PERSON> Shaat </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> to still be valid. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says the treaty is invalid and that the border is on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s eastern bank

<HEAD>Changes Planned in Indian Oil Rights Protection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new director of the <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the agency is developing a plan for doing a much better job of protecting Indian oil rights. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, who took over April 3 as head of the agency charged with protecting oil royalties to Indians, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee Friday that he is working on a package of changes from current policy. The special unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs spent the past week taking testimony from witnesses who criticized the minerals service, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> for not fulfilling the federal responsibility to protect Indian oil rights. `` The purpose of these hearings is to expose what has happened in the past, but more importantly chart a new course,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>. When lawyers showed <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> evidence the minerals service had not acted in accordance with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and Gas Royalty Management Act, he promised improvements. `` We can do better than we have done in the past'' was his refrain throughout questioning. Earlier Friday, a homeless <PERSON> Cherokee-Arapahoe </PERSON> woman said she was receiving only sporadic royalty payments on three wells in which she has an interest. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON>, who lives in an abandoned house in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, said the $ 30 to $ 60 payments she gets periodically keep her on the oil royalty rolls and make her ineligible for public assistance. Disabled by childhood polio, Mrs. <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON> can not work and said the state took away her two youngest children two years ago. She has n't been able to get any of the federal agencies responsible for Indian oil to tell her what has happened to her payments, she told the panel. Mrs. <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON> said her wells originally were leased by the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> which sold the leases to Koch Oil. She said that at one point, she heard the wells had been capped, but the farmer who works the land where the wells are located said trucks kept going on and off the oil field. Other witnesses told the committee that <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, which is based in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, had been taking more oil than it had paid for from Indian wells, a charge the company has denied. Mrs. <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON> is a participant in a federal class-action suit charging the government has violated its trust responsibilities to Indians with oil well interests, said attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the suit's plaintiffs include 7,000 allottees with interest in 944 oil leases in western <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. That suit has been held under advisement by Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of the western district of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> for two and one-half years, said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. A statement issued by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, court clerk for the western district of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said counsel for both sides have reported to the court that settlement offers have been ongoing while they watched an `` almost identical'' case pending in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The statement said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case was settled by an entry of consent decree in March, and that both parties in Mrs. <PERSON> Limpy </PERSON>'s case filed a status report last month that `` specific settlement offers were forthcoming'' and that the parties would report on their progress in July The court said they waited on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case to avoid a potential conflict in rulings, to avoid delays in possible appeals and to `` enhance the prospects of an agreed settlement in the case.''

<TEXT>
 The attorney for former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> says a classified documents law would force him to give prosecutors `` a soup to nuts disclosure'' of the defense's case before the Iran-Contra figure goes to trial. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told a court hearing Friday that the Classified Information Procedures Act was unconstitutional and would seriously harm <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> when former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was helping supply weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras during a congressional ban on such assistance. A federal grand jury, under supervision of Iran-Contra independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, charged that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> lied about his role in the Contra arms network. The Classified Information Procedures Act would force the defense to notify prosecutors in advance of the classified documents <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> plans to use. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> that `` 100 percent of the domain of evidence is classified'' and that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> would have to `` reveal his defense in a way that would be wholly unreciprocated by the government.'' Iran-Contra prosecutor <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> told the judge that much of the information in the case no longer involves classified matters and that the defense `` overstates what is required.'' <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> took the case under advisement. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who used the code name of <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was charged with four criminal counts. He is accused of obstructing inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel and the presidentially appointed Tower commission that investigated the Iran-Contra arms and money affair, and false swearing in connection with those inquiries. The indictment said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> falsely told the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> that an airstrip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, used to supply the Contras, was built by the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> government to train pilots for a possible Nicaraguan invasion of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> allegedly lied to the Tower commission by denying that he knew the now-convicted <PERSON> North </PERSON> was involved in helping arm the Contras. Each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximum five-year sentence and a $ 250,000 fine upon conviction. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> noted that a hearing was scheduled May 26 on documents that prosecutors might have to reveal to the defense. The judge said that if he rules the government must give the defense substantial information about the prosecution case, there would be no harm to <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. North's trial on Iran-Contra charges was conducted under the classified procedures law, after surviving a similar challenge from the defense.

<TEXT>
 After three years of court battles, a federal appeals court ruled Friday to permit the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to conduct random drug testing of police officers. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in favor of a police department regulation issued in 1986 that requires random drug testing of all police department employees. `` I am deeply concerned for the health and safety of our police officers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> in a statement prepared after the decision. `` They are human and engaged in perhaps the most stressful profession in our society. Therefore I believe that this drug testing policy is beneficial to the public as well as to the police officers in this city and in the country.'' The 1600-member <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which claims the law is unconstitutional, vowed Friday to take the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Under agreement reached by both parties in the case, the regulation will not be imposed until the appeals process has been fully exhausted. `` These rules conjure up memories of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are very major implications here. The broader question is how far can the government go in searching the bodies of its employees? Are blood tests and mandatory psychiatric tests next?'' The two-page decision by the appeals court cited two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in March that upheld the government's right to require drug and alcohol tests for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers involved in drug interdiction and for railroad workers involved in accidents. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that public safety outweighs constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches. The decision reached in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was one of three suits filed by police unions around the country against proposed drug detection programs. Cases involving drug testing in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, police departments are still under review. The appeals court decision stemmed from a suit brought in federal court in October 1986 by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier that year, <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> had proposed mandatory random testing as part of efforts to ensure a drug-free force. In May 1988, U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> upheld urine tests of police officers as a result of suspicion of drug abuse but ruled that a provision of the regulation imposing random tests without suspicion was unconstitutional and was an unreasonable search and seizure of an officer's body fluids. Drug testing of police officers has been a controversial issue in police departments across the country. Most police departments have attempted to test only those officers under suspicion or involved with drug interdiction. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began random drug testing of certain narcotics squads. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, random testing for drugs was started last October among the estimated 1,000 officers assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> began a random mandatory testing program for its members. The program was suspended after eight months when the state attorney general advised it may be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officers have asked that an annual mandatory drug screening exam be written into their contracts. Approximately 5 million Americans are subject to drug testing each year, usually as a condition of employment.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders, saying they're tired of warning about the ill effects of massive federal deficits, expect a sharp slowdown in economic growth to result in disappointing revenues for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and exacerbate the nation's deficit The Business Council, made up of 65 chief executives from the nation's top corporations, predicted Friday that the government's red ink next year will total $ 135 billion, well above the $ 100 billion maximum that is allowed under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law `` Every year I've been here I have to say the same thing,'' <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told business leaders at this mountain resort. `` We in the business community are still very concerned ... about the deficits.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, after protracted negotiations with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, has drafted a fiscal 1990 budget that it says would hold the deficit to just under the Gramm-Rudman limit. The business leaders were unconvinced of that projection, yet somewhat encouraged that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration at least were talking to one another. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the latest $ 1.2 trillion spending plan wo n't do much to reduce the deficit, `` but the fact that they're not fighting, that they've come to step one, is positive in my mind.'' `` Step two will have to be for them to deal with it in real terms, and it must be dealt with or we're going to have some discontinuities that could be severe,'' he said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the budget and trade deficits are being closely watched because they `` have a direct bearing on our industry and how people feel about the economy.'' `` It's going to be a good year ... from what we can see, providing nothing untoward happens in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said corporate officials are `` disappointed that a more serious bite of the apple was n't taken in the new budget.'' `` On the other hand, we do have a feeling of encouragement that at least ... <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch act like they're more serious about trying to grab hold of the problem,'' he said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the council in a private session Friday that the 1990 budget would come in right around the Gramm-Rudman target and was `` worth an awful lot'' because it set the stage for further negotiations. `` I remain convinced that there is a very significant process that has been set in motion that might address the deficit that otherwise would go totally unattended and create grid lock and chaos,'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said after the session. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Penner </PERSON>, senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the business leaders the budget was disappointing because it again uses accounting gimmicks to reduce the red ink. `` Every year we do a little bit; every year we claim we did more than we do,'' he said. The Business Council is forecasting that economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, will slow from last year's healthy 3.9 percent pace to 1.4 percent by the end of the year The council projected GNP growth of 2.9 percent for all of 1989 and 1.7 percent next year. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, a top aide to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, told the council that the recent slowing in economic activity was `` a pause and a base for further expansion.'' The administration is pinning its deficit-reduction plans on an optimistic expectation for GNP growth of 3.2 percent this year.

<TEXT>
 The American business community has been able to operate successfully in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> despite political violence, government-fanned hostility toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against the government. The community plans to stay open for business, but its greatest threats come from long-range political instability and a continued economic downturn, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Companies gradually are relocating and will keep doing so as long as Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in power and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions remain in place, he said. The spokesman, who also is a partner in a Panamanian business, asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. `` I do n't see any short-run solution,'' he said Friday. `` Members of the chamber do n't feel our friend -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- is showing any willingness to move, and we have to make plans on that sort of scenario. `` Companies that have plants here, such as <LOCATION> Borden </LOCATION>, probably will continue as long as they can pay their payroll and so forth. Others, like <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, which have regional offices here, may decide to locate them elsewhere,'' he said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said operations have not been affected by the unrest. He said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s fewer than 100 employees in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> include a handful of Americans, and they have not been advised to leave or take unusual precautions. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advised <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessmen to make plans to get dependents out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. However, one executive of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importing firm said he did not plan to move his wife and children `` because we do n't want to live in an Army base.'' Like most Americans contacted, he said he had encountered no hostility from Panamanians or had any problems. `` The anti-Americanism just is n't out there,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official said. An anti-U.S. offensive by the government found little support among Panamanians, he said. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been a regional center for a lot of companies. In the last two years this configuration is down at least 50 percent. It will drop further if this thing continues much longer,'' the spokesman said. A foreign business specialist, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said: `` In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the key to Americans doing business these days is, ` let's make a deal.''' When economic sanctions aimed at getting rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were announced in 1988, there was widespread fear that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would close businesses that did not pay required taxes to the government. That did not happen. The businesses, which hire thousands of Panamanians and buy millions of dollars worth of goods from Panamanian companies each year, stayed open. `` There certainly is some bartering of services to the government in lieu of taxes paid,'' the specialist said, but added that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also recognizes the economic impact that closing the businesses would mean in a nation with a 20 percent unemployment rate. Many executives of many multinational corporations, including several leaders, have been replaced the past two years by Panamanians, he said. `` The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> here is a Panamanian, so is the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` The banks in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are pretty well locally managed now too.'' The economic sanctions, he said, are more damaging to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business than to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government. The sanctions prevent American companies and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government entities from paying taxes to the government. `` By <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> calculations all the taxes we should pay and do n't would keep the Panamanian government afloat for only two days,'' he said. He added that many multinational businesses have been losing money in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of its economy, and some company officials soon may decide to close operations there. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a small country, and it would not be a major loss to some of the biggest companies,'' he said. `` The tragedy is that once <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> loses those companies, it is hard for it to get them back.''

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ambassador-designate to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, faces further questioning by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel about his knowledge in 1985 and 1986 of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret network to arm the Nicaraguan On Friday, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser when he was vice president, of `` sponsoring a free-lance, covert operation out of the vice president's office.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was making `` sweeping denials'' of his knowledge about the Nicaraguan Contra network `` apparently in order to cover up the truth and to limit embarrassment to your boss, then-presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Even though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the time had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said it did n't occur to him that there was anything `` ipso facto illegal.'' He said former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had been focusing on alleged corruption by some of the arms dealers involved in the network and did n't think that kind of matter was sufficiently `` vice presidential'' to tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> underwent a three-hour hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> foreign relations subcommittee chaired by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, who said later through an office spokesman that there will be further questioning on the Iran-Contra affair. `` There's going to be another hearing,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flander </PERSON>. `` The questions have not all been asked or answered.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> says he did n't find out until August 1986 from <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> that <PERSON> North </PERSON> might be involved with facilitating the supply of lethal aid to the Contras. With support from <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to help the air force there counter guerrilla insurgents. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he did n't know until the August 1986 meeting that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was involved in helping the Contras. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s training at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and friendship with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> `` apparently led you to believe you could serve the national interest by sponsoring a free-lance, covert operation out of the vice president's office,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. The senator said a cover story about <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' sole mission in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> being to help the Salvadoran air force `` was seemingly concocted.'' `` I think it is a rather full-blown example of a conspiracy theory,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s comments. `` That's not what I was doing. It is not what <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> was doing, to my knowledge. My job was to keep the vice president informed. I did not have operational responsibility for anything. ... To do that would have been the quickest way for me to lose my job.'' The ambassador-designate for the first time offered what he called `` a speculative explanation'' of the fact that two April 1986 documents from his office said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to be briefed on `` resupply of the Contras'' in a meeting with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` I believe the agenda item was a garbled reference to resupply of copters'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> `` instead of resupply of the Contras,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified. He declined to specify whether he thought his aide, Col. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, or a secretary, had gotten the wording garbled. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> recalled that at the time, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was concerned that helicopters being used by the Salvadoran military needed spare parts. He said he came to the conclusion that the reference had gotten garbled after seeing galleys of a book <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> recently completed.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is preparing to lobby hard for a tough resolution denouncing <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> when <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meet next week to discuss the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> crisis. But Panamanian authorities are expected to blame the upheaval in their country on what they regard as systematic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> permanent council on Friday approved a <LOCATION> Venezuelan </LOCATION> proposal for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers to meet next Wednesday to discuss the `` serious crisis'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. While many delegates expressed concern about the interruption of the election process and the violence directed against some Panamanian opposition leaders, others argued against interfering in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s representative, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, used the occasion to blast <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions, saying, `` We will not bow to the colossus of the north.'' He cited reports alleging that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration donated $ 10 million to the opposition candidate's campaign. He also said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had funded a clandestine anti-government radio operation, that preparations were being made to scuttle the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are engaged in hostile military maneuvers. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON>, said that in the interest of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must raise its collective voice `` against the dictator <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and demand that he respect the will of the courageous people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began referring to the opposition candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, as the president-elect of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, based on exit polls showing he had a sizeable lead over the pro-Noriega candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, said there seemed to be little likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers would designate <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as the winner. There also was some doubt that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> would approve a resolution condemning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the officials said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was expected to fight hard for a toughly worded resolution, but strong resistance was anticipated from a number of countries, especially <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, both of which attach high priority to the principle of non-interference. Even <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which initiated the call for a foreign ministers meeting, was restrained in outlining its reasons. Ambassador <PERSON> Edilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> made no direct reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying only that `` the popular will'' of hemispheric nations must be respected and that a meeting of foreign ministers at this time is appropriate given the `` grave crisis'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The strongest anti-Noriega statement during the meeting was delivered by Jamaican Ambassador <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who denounced `` this blatant rape of democracy'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Cape Cod Dune Shacks Win Historic Designation, Future Still In Doubt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Seventeen rustic shacks on the outer dunes of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> could still be ripped down even though the huts, which provided soul-searching solitude to <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> and scores of other creative minds, have won national historic designation. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Friday placed the primitive huts on the National Register of Historic Places over the objections of regional officials at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seashore </LOCATION>. `` The dune shacks are an important part of the pattern of artistic and cultural life on the outer <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> and merit the protection and recognition of the National Register,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that pushed for the designation. But <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cables </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said earlier this year that a historic designation `` affords no guarantee of protection.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> could raze these shacks. There's still potential for that to happen,'' said <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shean-Hammond </PERSON>, a regional <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> But she said regional officials vowed in December that all the huts would be preserved until plans for the area are completed. She said preservation of the dune shacks in those plans `` is under full consideration.'' `` For the next few years, we do n't see anything happening at all,'' <PERSON> Shean-Hammond </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a dune hut activist, remained skeptical. `` All I know is for 30 years they've been doing everything they could to destroy these shacks,'' she said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> called the historic designation `` a small victory, but it really does n't mean a lot. It's still up to the National Seashore -LRB- officials -RRB- to decide what to do with them.'' She said three of the shacks have been razed since 1984 and two of the remaining 17 had been slated for destruction. The one - and two-room gray shingled beach huts lie between <LOCATION> Truro </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION> near the tip of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> Built in the 1920s and 1930s by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> as shelters, the weather-beaten shacks offer none of the conveniences of modern life, such as electricity and plumbing. But they provide peaceful hideaways in a strikingly unspoiled setting reachable only by four-wheel drive vehicles or walking. `` Yes, residence on the dunes ... is uniquely sheltering and certainly stimulating to creative work,'' <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> wrote in a 1963 letter. `` It's true that I was working on ` On the Road' there, summer of 1950.'' Preservationists say the shacks have been used by <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>, poet e.e. cummings, author <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> and scores of lesser-known painters, poets, playwrights and novelists, earning them a place in American history and worthy of protection. The shacks came under <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> control in 1961 when the government purchased 27,000 acres of outer <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> land for the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION>. A private group has been managing the rustic huts, renting them for $ 150 a week. <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> previously had maintained that the dune shacks did not have the architectural or historic value to warrant preservation. The service had indicated the shacks would be demolished after leases with the current owners expire over the next 16 years.

<HEAD>Space Council Seeks to Extend Landsat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to commit to funding the Landsat earth-sensing satellites, which were almost shut down in March, through fiscal 1991. The council, under the leadership of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, made the recommendation Friday. `` This signifies a real commitment of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> administration to be aggressive in space,'' said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Landsat program, launched in 1978, has long been plagued by funding uncertainty because the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had hoped to commercialize it. That proved not to be feasible, the source said. `` For the first time, the administration has stepped forward and said it -LRB- Landsat -RRB- could not be fully commercialized well into the 21st century,'' the source said. `` The demand for the data has not grown as rapidly as early forecasts had projected.'' Indeed, the federal government is Landsat's biggest client, although 13 countries have bought Landsat stations, he said. The Landsat satellites were due to be turned off March 31, when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was to run out of money to operate them. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> announced on March 6 that he had gained a commitment for funds to keep the program going until the space council, which studies national space programs, completed a review. Two satellites currently are in operation, Landsat 4 and Landsat 5. They provide photos for mineral exploration, checking soil conditions and vegetation, urban and rural planning, monitoring volcanoes and tracing ocean currents. But both have been running well beyond their expected lifetimes and are no longer fully functional. An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is scheduled to be launched in 1991. The space council recommended money be made available to continue operations of Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 through fiscal 1990. That, combined with the $ 200 million already committed to launching Landsat 6 in 1991, `` will give you data continuity until 1996,'' the source said. However, the source of funding after fiscal 1991 remained a question. The space council directed the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and council staff to focus on ways to keep the data flowing. The council's decision calls for user departments and agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> departments and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to provide the $ 5 million needed to continue the program through the remainder of fiscal 1989. The space council hopes to obtain $ 19 million needed for the 1990 fiscal year through a supplemental request for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, the source said. `` We've already paid almost $ 200 million for <ORGANIZATION> Landsat </ORGANIZATION> 6,'' the official said. `` This signals commitment in the long run, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' continued leadership in space and space technology.'' The official said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> demonstrated during the meeting the satellites' ability to highlight environmental concerns. `` The vice president had in the room images from April 7 from the Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and you could clearly see where the oil spill was,'' the administration official said. `` You could clearly see that Landsat can have real use to environmental matters.''

<HEAD>Railroad Administration Says It Wasn't To Blame for Iowa Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was unfairly blamed for contributing to a fiery train collision in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last summer that killed two people, an <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> official said today. The complaint was voiced by <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, chief counsel for the agency, in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said last Tuesday that failures by the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> to enforce train operating rules were part of what caused the July 30 head-on crash between two freight trains. Two crewmen on a westbound train were killed when it collided with an eastbound train at <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>. More than 2,000 people were evacuated from their homes as two tank cars containing 20,000 gallons of denatured alcohol burned for more than two days. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION>, which operated both trains, and said the eastbound train had been operated by a fatigued crew. The panel also blamed the FRA for failing to act against <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, said the criticism of the FRA `` is not only unfounded; it demonstrates a basic lack of understanding of the difference between a railroad's own rules and federal regulations, and it evidences a remarkable ignorance of <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION>'s rail safety program and rules.'' The crash was caused by one train leaving too early in violation of an internal railroad order, <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> said. `` To state the elementary, violation of a train order constitutes a violation of railroad rules, not federal regulations; responsibility for enforcing compliance with the railroad's own rules is the railroad's, not <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' he wrote. `` FRA is not the guarantor of rail safety,'' he said. `` Instead, its mission is to develop appropriate safety standards for the industry, to monitor railroad compliance and to conduct an enforcement effort that will have a deterrent effect overall.'' `` FRA can not prevent every instance of non-compliance, nor can it control the propensity for human beings to make bad decisions or to behave negligently,'' he said.

 Here is the prepared text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech Friday to graduating seniors at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. My sincerest congratulations go to every graduate, and to your parents. In this ceremony, we celebrate nothing less than the commencement of the rest, and the best, of your life. When you look back to your days at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M, you will have a lot to be proud of _ a university that is first in baseball and first in service to our nation. Many are the heroes whose names are called at Muster. Many are those you remember in Silver Taps. We are reminded that no generation can escape history. Parents _ we share a fervent desire for our children, and their children, to know a better world, a safer world. Students _ your parents and grandparents have lived through a world war, and helped <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to rebuild the world. They witnessed the drama of postwar nations divided by Soviet subversion and force, but sustained by an allied response most vividly seen in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift. Wise men _ <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rayburn </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON> _ crafted the strategy of containment. They believed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, denied the easy course of expansion, would turn inward and address the contradictions of its inefficient, repressive and inhumane system. And they were right. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is now publicly facing this hard reality. Containment worked. Containment worked because our democratic principles, institutions and values are sound, and always have been. It worked because our alliances were and are strong; and because the superiority of free societies and free markets over stagnant socialism is undeniable. We are approaching the conclusion of an historic postwar struggle between two visions _ one of tyranny and conflict, and one of democracy and freedom. The review of U.S.-Soviet relations that my administration has just completed outlines a new path toward resolving this struggle.

<HEAD>COLLEGE STATION, Texas: this struggle.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Our goal is bold _ more ambitious than any of my predecessors might have thought possible. Our review indicates that 40 years of perseverance have brought us a precious opportunity. Now it is time to move beyond containment, to a new policy for the 1990s _ one that recognizes the full scope of change taking place around the world, and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself. In sum, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has as its goal much more than simply containing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> expansionism _ we seek the integration of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the community of nations. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> moves toward greater openness and democratization _ as they meet the challenge of responsible international behavior _ we will match their steps with steps of our own. Ultimately, our objective is to welcome the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> back into the world order. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says it seeks to make peace with the world, and criticizes its own postwar policies. These are words we can only applaud. But a new relationship can not be simply declared by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, or bestowed by others. It must be earned. It must be earned because promises are never enough. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has promised a more cooperative relationship before, only to reverse course and return to militarism. Soviet foreign policy has been almost seasonal _ warmth before cold, thaw before freeze. We seek a friendship that knows no season of suspicion, no chill of distrust. We hope perestroika is pointing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to a break with the cycles of the past _ a definitive break. Who would have thought we would see the deliberations of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the front page of Pravda, or dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> seated near the councils of power? Who would have imagined a Soviet leader who canvasses the sidewalks of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>? These are hopeful _ indeed, remarkable _ signs. Let no one doubt our sincere desire to see perestroika continue and succeed. But the national security of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and our allies is not predicated on hope. It must be based on deeds. We look for enduring, ingrained economic and political change.

<HEAD>COLLEGE STATION, Texas: political change.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 While we hope to move beyond containment, we are only at the beginning of our new path. Many dangers and uncertainties are ahead. We must not forget that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has acquired awesome military capabilities. That was a fact of life for my predecessors. That has always been a fact of life for our allies. And that is a fact of life for me. As we seek peace, we must also remain strong. The purpose of our military might is not to pressure a weak Soviet economy, or to seek military superiority. It is to deter war. It is to defend ourselves and our allies, and to do something more _ to convince the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that there can be no reward in pursuing expansionism _ to convince the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that reward lies in the pursuit of peace. Western policies must encourage the evolution of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> toward an open society. This task will test our strength. It will tax our patience. And it will require a sweeping vision _ let me share with you my vision. I see a Western Hemisphere of democratic, prosperous nations, no longer threatened by a <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or a <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> armed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. I see a Soviet Union that pulls away from ties to terrorist nations _ like <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> _ that threaten the legitimate security of their neighbors. I see a Soviet Union which respects <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s integrity, and returns the Northern Territories of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; a prelude to the day when all the great nations of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will live in harmony. But the fulfillment of this vision requires the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to take positive steps, including: First: Reduce Soviet forces. Although some small steps have already been taken, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact still possesses more than 30,000 tanks, more than twice as much artillery and hundreds of thousands more troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. They should cut their forces to less threatening levels, in proportion to their legitimate security needs. Second: Adhere to the Soviet obligation _ promised in the final days of World War II _ to support self-determination for all the nations of Eastern and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This requires specific abandonment of the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>. One day it should be possible to drive from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> without seeing a single guard tower or a strand of barbed wire. In short, tear down the Iron Curtain.

 Third: Work with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in positive, practical _ not merely rhetorical _ steps toward diplomatic solutions to regional disputes around the world. I welcome the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> agreement. But there is much more to be done around the world. We're ready. Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work. Fourth: Achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for human rights. Dramatic events have already occurred in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. We are impressed by limited, but freely contested, elections. We are impressed by a greater toleration of dissent. We are impressed by a new frankness about the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, do n't stop now. Fifth: Join with us in addressing pressing global problems, including the international drug menace, and dangers to the environment. We can build a better world for our children. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> moves toward arms reduction and reform, it will find willing partners in the West. We seek verifiable, stabilizing arms control and arms reduction agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies. However, arms control is not an end in itself, but a means of contributing to the security of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the peace of the world. I directed Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to propose to the Soviets that we resume negotiations on strategic forces in June. And, as you know, the Soviets have agreed. Our basic approach is clear. In the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, we wish to reduce the risk of nuclear war. In the companion <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Space Talks, our objective will be to preserve our options to deploy advanced defenses when they are ready. In nuclear testing we will continue to seek the necessary verification improvements in existing treaties to permit them to be brought into force. We will continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons. We support <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> efforts to reduce the Soviet offensive threat in the negotiations on Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And, as I've said, fundamental to all of these objectives is simple openness.

<HEAD>COLLEGE STATION, Texas: simple openness.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Make no mistake, a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and cities of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Why not, then, let this spirit of openness grow, let more barriers come down. Open emigration, open debate, open airwaves _ let openness come to mean the publication and sale of banned books and newspapers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Let the 19,000 Soviet Jews who emigrated last year be followed by any number who wish to emigrate this year. Let openness come to mean nothing less than the free exchange of people, books and ideas between East and West. And let it come to mean one thing more. Thirty-four years ago, President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with Soviet leaders who, after the death of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, promised a new approach toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. He proposed a plan called `` Open Skies,'' which would allow unarmed aircraft from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to fly over the territory of the other country. This would open up military activities to regular scrutiny and, as President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> put it, `` convince the world that we are ... lessening danger and relaxing tension.'' President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s suggestion tested Soviet readiness to open their society. The Kremlin failed that test. Let us again explore that proposal, but on a broader, more intrusive and radical basis _ one which I hope would include allies on both sides. We suggest that those countries that wish to examine this proposal meet soon to work out the necessary operational details, separately from other arms control negotiations. Such surveillance flights, complementing satellites, would provide regular scrutiny for both sides. Such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the meaning of the concept of openness. The very Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitment to change.

 Where there is cooperation, there can be a broader economic relationship. But economic relations have been stifled by Soviet internal policies. They have been injured by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s practice of using the cloak of commerce to steal technology from the West. Ending discriminatory treatment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms would be a helpful step. Trade and financial transactions should take place on a normal commercial basis. And should the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> codify its emigration laws in accord with international standards and implement its new laws faithfully, I am prepared to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a temporary waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, opening the way to extending Most Favored Nation trade status to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Unon </LOCATION>. The policy I have just described has everything to do with you. Today you graduate. You will start careers and families. And you will become the leaders of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the next century. What kind of world will you know? Perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of nations. It is a sad truth that nothing forces us to recognize our common humanity more swiftly than a natural disaster. I am thinking of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, just a few months ago _ a tragedy without blame, warlike devastation without war. My son took our 12-year-old grandson to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. At the end of a day of comforting the injured and consoling the bereaved, father and son sat down together amid the ruins and wept. How can our two countries magnify this simple expression of caring? How can we each convey the goodwill of our people? Forty-three years ago, a young lieutenant by the name of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotzebue </PERSON>, Class of 1945 at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M, was the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier to shake hands with the Soviets at the banks of the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Once again, we are ready to extend our hand. Once again, we are ready for a hand in return. Once again, it is a time for peace.

 The space agency is juggling the launch schedule for five space shuttle flights, including postponement until 1990 of the Hubble Space Telescope mission long awaited by scientists. The schedule changes, announced Friday, became necessary when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided last month that the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> could not be readied in time for a July launch because of modifications that must be made. Because of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s lag, officials said they could not support two missions in the July-August time period and still preserve an October launch period for the high-priority <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>.

 A runaway freight train jumped its tracks at 90 mph on a downhill grade and plowed into a row of houses Friday, killing at least three people, two of them children. `` The train was all over the place. It looked like a toy in a sandbox. It was just everywhere _ in people's yards. Pieces of the axles were in people's yards,'' said witness <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorame </PERSON>. Late Friday evening, a 24-year-old man was found alive in the wreckage of a home more than 14 hours after the accident, said police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. He was found shortly before 9 p.m. Tentatively identified as <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, he had been asleep when the 69-car train derailed and plowed through his home. Earlier Friday, at least two people were reported missing and firefighters and police combed the wreckage of the residential neighborhood. Two specially trained dogs from the volunteer <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> were used to search the rubble of the homes and the train. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said it would not begin moving the wrecked cars until word was received that all homes had been searched. Hospitals reported treating at least eight people for varying injuries, including the train's engineer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, 34, a 14-year <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> employee who was pulled from the wreckage by witnesses. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> was listed in serious condition with broken ribs, bruises and cuts, said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardine </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight apparently lost its brakes toward the top of treacherous, 4,190-foot Cajon Pass and came raging down the grade at more than 90 mph before the derailment, said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephanson </PERSON>. It flew off an embankment and into a neighborhood of modest two-and three-bedroom homes on the northwest outskirts of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, smashing houses and throwing out its load of sand-like potash. <PERSON> Stephanson </PERSON> said one of the five crewmembers radioed to a dispatcher in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that the train was out of control. `` They said the speed was 90 mph a few miles up the track -LRB- from the crash site -RRB-,'' he said. `` They absolutely were out of control. ... It was a runaway train.'' He said the train apparently lost its brakes near the top of the pass in the mountains about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The train had four engines in front and two `` helper engines'' in back, and had between 55 and 69 cars in all. The rear engines had applied full brakes, <PERSON> Stephanson </PERSON> said. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said the train hit 11 homes. Six were destroyed, one had major damage and four had minor damage inflicted by the train, flying dirt and rocks from the roadbed and the potash, a mineral used in making fertilizer and soap. Property damage was estimated at $ 600,000. `` The engine came off the track and went through a house,'' said <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, who saw the crash on his way to work. `` It was terrible, there were train cars on top of houses, train cars on top of cars. It sounded like a couple of bombs going off.'' `` It was going down from <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> real fast, did n't have no brakes. I looked over, part of the train was in the air. It just fell back on the ground and all the sand started flying up in the air and stuff,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, a little boy who saw the wreck. The pass is the major road and rail conduit from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Interstate 15 passes through it. The dead were identified as conductor <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crown </PERSON>, 36, a member of the Bakersfield-based train crew and a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> worker since 1972, and stepbrothers <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 7, whose home was smashed by the train. Another crew member, brakeman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, 44, who has been with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> since 1971, was still listed as missing, said train master <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveland </PERSON> said the railroad will help people left homeless by the crash. `` We feel terrible about this,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said a shelter had been set up at the <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and 10 people had registered by late afternoon. About 200 people were kept from their homes for a time for fear that leaking diesel fuel could ignite, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. He said most of the injuries were minor. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, was flying in from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to direct the investigation, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mucho </PERSON>, the regional director. He said there was no indication of the cause. The train was carrying potash from the high-desert town of <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pera </PERSON>. The tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day, forcing detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains a day, <PERSON> Pera </PERSON> said. The trains, including <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-to-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> service, would use a route through <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION>, he said. Elsewhere, a derailment near <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, spilled thousands of gallons of antifreeze and diesel fuel into the <LOCATION> Chunky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and residents were told Friday to keep away from the river. No injuries were reported in the Thursday night derailment of a <ORGANIZATION> MidSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> train but more than 200 people were evacuated from the area and told they may not be able to return home until late Saturday or Sunday. Officials said those evacuated early Friday included 22 residents of a nursing home. `` We now estimate that 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of ethylene glycol alcohol _ antifreeze _ got into the river along with 3,000 to 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel,'' said <PERSON> Eleana </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Twelve cars and three of the train's five engines left the tracks, with two of the engines landing partly in the river.

After an `` abusive'' marriage that ended in divorce, she `` stayed home and devoted my time and effort to raising my children, because we were all wounded from the trauma of the divorce.'' `` For the first time I had to experience taking care of myself, and it was quite difficult,'' Ms. <PERSON> Liebhaber </PERSON> said. She said she's never had a job outside the home, and makes ends meet with child support and food stamps. Her ex-husband, who's in the military, has paid regular child support, Ms. <PERSON> Liebhaber </PERSON> said, and all her children except her youngest are covered under the military's health care plan. The birth of her youngest child, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, provided the impetus for her to enroll at <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION> two months later, and her struggle to get child support influenced her decision to go on to law school, she said. `` My youngest was my gift; he brought love and life back into this family,'' Ms. <PERSON> Liebhaber </PERSON> said. She said her other children were `` surprised, but they were very accepting, and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> is very loved.'' Raised in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Liebhaber </PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> for two years before she was married, and the credits she earned were accepted at <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION>. The private, Jesuit-run university's general studies program is designed to allow more flexibility in scheduling and curriculum content for adult students. `` I enrolled in <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION> two years ago directly as a result of their non-traditional program, which would allow me to raise my children and achieve a quality education,'' she said. `` She's a hero,'' said her academic adviser, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, dean of the college of professional studies. `` She's come from a difficult personal situation, achieved a perfect academic record, and she's headed for law school `` It shows what a mature woman can do when she puts her mind to it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Liebhaber </PERSON> said her situation _ receiving regular child support and health care for her children _ was atypical of many single mothers who return to college. She did n't have to hold down a job while attending classes, and her daughter, now 14, took care of her infant son and her other four sons did their own laundry and helped with housework. `` I do n't think my case is that extraordinary ... What I'm doing is what millions of women do without any kind of fanfare or acknowledgment,'' she said. `` Fortunately for me, I've been given a good intellect so that I can succeed in school.'' Although Ms. <PERSON> Liebhaber </PERSON> was apprehensive about having her accomplishments publicized, she hopes her story inspires other women. `` It's been a remarkable experience,'' she said. `` But I have a lot yet to do with my life. I'm only 38.''

 A <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> sheriff rode a helicopter over snowbound peaks of the <LOCATION> Bitterroot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to capture a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man who allegedly confessed to killing his wife in a chilling letter to a newspaper. Mineral County Sheriff <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilder </PERSON> and a member of his volunteer posse were waiting on the west side of <LOCATION> Hoodoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> when <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenecker </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, wandered across the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> border into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schoenecker </PERSON> was cold but in good physical condition, despite four days in which he apparently wandered the mountain range of 7,000-foot peaks still locked in winter snow with freezing nighttime temperatures. The man abandoned his car Tuesday on a mountain road near <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, on the state's western border. That was a day after he allegedly mailed a letter from a <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, motel to <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmers </PERSON>. `` Last Friday night I shot and killed my wife,'' began the five-page letter, received Thursday. `` There was no hatred _ I loved her _ but the action was necessary because I have a purpose and one that can not have an interruption or interference.'' <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said Friday that police had confirmed that the body they found Thursday afternoon in the Schoenecker's <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> home was that of Mrs. <PERSON> Schoenecker </PERSON>, an elementary school teacher. The letter said <PERSON> Schoenecker </PERSON> killed his wife because she did n't understand the premonitions and `` images'' he had about people who had `` done wrong or evil'' against him `` Several times I tried to explain these ` happenings' to <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> -LRB- my wife -RRB- but she dismissed them. I was never understood. I knew that as these feelings and ` pictures' continued to occur and repeat that I had to prepare a way, develop a plan, make arrangements. And I have done so. `` Now, I had to eliminate my wife. She would n't believe me. She would n't even listen. So in order to keep her from finding out, I developed a separate plan or storyline that totally misled her, but it did make her happy. She was very happy on Friday.'' The letter suggested Schoenecker might try to kill other people. `` I've left a list _ a partial list. Not everyone on the list will receive total punishment _ but they will be punished,'' the letter said. Police searched the couple's home and found a list of 54 people, the majority from the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilder </PERSON> said his officers had been tracking Schoenecker, a chemical engineer, since Thursday, when <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> police reported finding his wife's body. A snowmobiler's tip on Friday provided the final lead. `` Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and I went to the snowline in a patrol car,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilder </PERSON> said. `` I radioed for the helicopter. ... I asked the pilot to fly the road and see how far this individual was ahead of us.'' The helicopter then returned and took <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilder </PERSON> and a member of his posse into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, dropping them about a mile from the border on the route <PERSON> Schoenecker </PERSON> was following. `` We waited for him and let him get within 20 or 30 feet,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schoenecker </PERSON> was carrying a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver, but did not resist when confronted, the sheriff He was being held in the Mineral County jail on a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> warrant pending the arrival of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> police.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> urged students to join his campaign for education reform by appearing in person at a small Indian high school and, by satellite, at remote schools across the West. `` I came here to learn. You can help teach me,'' he told the 30 students and dozen teachers and administrators at <ORGANIZATION> Pyramid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` We have serious problems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in terms of education. If we work together, perhaps we can correct some of the mistakes we have made in the past.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> joined four students to view and participate in a sociology class beamed by satellite to the remote Paiute Indian reservation school through the `` Star Schools'' program, which offers advanced courses to classrooms in rural or isolated areas. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> is 48 miles northeast of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> along the shores of <LOCATION> Pyramid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. The satellite classes originate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and are sent out over the <ORGANIZATION> TI-IN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Students can ask their TV teacher questions by telephone. Besides sociology, the network offers such courses as advanced math, science and foreign languages. As the class' featured guest, the education secretary fielded questions from students in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Sociology teacher <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> opened the door to one of <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' favorite topics when she asked how his upbringing led him to the cabinet `` I started to school in a two-room schoolhouse on a ranch in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` My father always told me, ` Education is the most valuable thing you can have and nobody can take it away from you.''' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said one of his goals is to convince parents that learning begins at home, long before their youngsters are in school. `` Education begins with the parents,'' he told Mrs. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. The secretary told the students he is concerned that 27 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remain illiterate and that 28 percent of the nation's students drop out. Although budget deficits occupy much of the time on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, `` until you solve the education deficit, you wo n't overcome the other deficits,'' he said. `` We made a commitment that we'd go to the moon. We went to the moon,'' he told the students. `` Our national commitment to education must start right here in this room.'' It was <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' first experience with the `` Star Schools'' program since becoming education secretary Sept. 30. His department financed the four regional partnerships in the program with a $ 19 million grant in October. `` I welcome the opportunity to meet and share some thoughts with you,'' he told the students. `` Your questions show an interest in education and a commitment to education.'' <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> <PERSON> New </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, a junior at the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> school, said the satellite program allowed her to take courses her small school could n't provide. `` They're pretty limited in the classes they have to offer. It's just the basics,'' she said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> met privately with school officials, tribal Chairman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Paslov </PERSON>, state superintendent of public instruction, before continuing his 11-day tour of schools across the country. `` We're here to learn about what's out there and what the issues are,'' he said at a news conference at the school. `` I read the data, but that ca n't tell me all I need to know. We have some deficits in education, but we also have some strengths. We need to work on those strengths and correct those deficits.''

<TEXT>
 The Chinese-Soviet alliance lasted only a decade, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s influence lingers 30 years later in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Stalinist political system, huge public halls and propaganda posters with rosy-cheeked socialist workers. A generation of writers in the 1950s filled their books with Soviet-style heros who fought for production, not love. Architects copied Soviet models to produce drearily grand buildings with high ceilings, huge chandeliers and stuffy halls. Western artistic influences now far exceed the Soviet influences, and new buildings are modeled on Western highrises. But the Soviet political stamp remains inbred in the structure of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` You call a ministry in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and can never find the right person. When you do find him, he ca n't make a decision'' _ just like in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, complained a former <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> diplomat to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. It's more than just shared inefficiency. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> copied the structure of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` wholesale,'' said <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruizhen </PERSON>, a Soviet scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. As in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, authority was tightly centralized, with orders flowing down from a handful of men at the top. The party became a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy, stationing officials in every government office with final say over decisions. A weak legislature and oversized Cabinet posed little threat to the party's power. Very little of this system has changed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since its split nearly three decades ago from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who visits <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> next week in a bid to smooth the breach, has done far more than <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to shake off the Stalinist political model. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet still is unwieldy with 41 ministers, and although the legislature has become more active in drafting legislation in recent years, it can not formulate policy. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has taken major steps away from <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s economic model, allowing market forces to set some prices. But large sectors of the economy remain centrally planned, with raw materials allocated by the center. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still announces five-year economic plans, like the Soviets. `` Generally speaking, we should cast off most of this,'' said <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugang </PERSON>, also a Soviet expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet system, he said, lacked a democratic foundation and in applying <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s principle of `` democratic centralism,'' too much emphasis was put on the centralism. `` Democratic centralism should mean that the minority submits to the majority,'' <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> said. `` If three of you take a position and I disagree, I should submit to you, but you should not gag me.'' In the arts, <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> recalled, Soviet influence was powerful during the 1950's alliance years. `` Many Soviet novels were translated into Chinese ... but few Western novels,'' he said. The Soviet novels were filled with `` iron-man'' heros who threw themselves into production for the motherland. `` The Soviets never wrote about love, only about revolution,'' said <PERSON> Xing </PERSON>. A generation of Chinese authors copied the example. As a result, over the decades since the revolution <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produced `` some good works of literature, but none that are outstanding,'' <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost has dramatically relaxed the controls on Soviet writers and led to a flurry of new literary activity. But <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> said this should n't be copied blindly from the Soviets. `` The Soviet model is not good enough for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to study,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should do better than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ it should study some things from the West.''

<DATELINE>ASHKELON, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-Arab anger has exploded in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over the slaying of an Israeli army sergeant and the disappearance of a second soldier, both blamed on Palestinians. In <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, just north of the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hundreds of Israelis took to the streets last week, screaming `` Death to the Arabs!'' and stoning Arab-owned cars. In nearby <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, residents beat an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> shopkeeper who employs Arabs and fractured the skull of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> motorist with a rock as he was waiting at a traffic light. `` The Arabs should be locked inside the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> so they can destroy each other. The time has come to punish them severely,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> secretary and neighbor of the missing soldier, <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>. She would not give her last name. Outbreaks of anti-Arab emotion often follow Palestinian attacks on Israelis. But the anger in recent days has escalated beyond the norm, apparently compounded by rising frustration over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s inability to stop the 17-month Palestinian uprising Hardline politicians, sensing the grumbling across the country, have stepped up their rhetoric and called for tougher measures to quell the rebellion against Israeli rule. Speaking after the fatal stabbing of two elderly Israelis in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on May 3, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public to deal with terrorists. `` If the murderers succeed, they should not be allowed to escape in one piece,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. His aides later denied he was urging vigilante justice. Transport Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> of Likud demanded the government seal off the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for three months, starting in July, to crush the uprising. The proposal, expected to be discussed soon by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, would bar Palestinians from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and journalists from covering the occupied lands. `` Their -LRB- the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> -RRB- free movement in sovereign <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has become dangerous,'' <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> said. During a three-month closure, he said, efforts would be made to replace the 110,000 Palestinians from the occupied lands who now work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, most in menial jobs such as construction, agriculture and santitation. Palestinian employment is already down. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, Palestinians put in about 25 percent fewer working hours each week than before the uprising in 1987. The drop is attributed both to army-imposed curfews in the occupied areas and to Palestinian general strikes called to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. In <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> city of 80,000 and hometown of slain soldier <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON>, officials are focusing their anger on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> employment, trying to phase out most of the 1,250 Arab workers. High school students, for example, were mobilized to clean streets during the Independence Day holiday when the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was under curfew. Mayor <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> wants to raise manual labor wages by 25 percent to make the jobs more attractive to Israelis and has suggested offering army veterans a one-year university scholarship in exchange for one year of manual labor. The city council will vote on the ideas Sunday. The proposals were sparked by the May 7 discovery of <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON>' body in a grave 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> Authorities said <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON> was shot to death by Palestinians who gave a ride to the hitchhiking soldier Feb. 16. The discovery unleashed several days of anti-Arab rioting in the city, and city officials decided to escort <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers to the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to prevent them from being attacked. During a visit to <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> on Friday, anti-Arab sentiments still ran high in <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Shimson </LOCATION> neighborhood, a run-down housing project populated mostly by immigrants from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The Arabs are walking around freely, and nobody is stopping them. They should not be allowed to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elka </PERSON>, 18, a neighbor and former classmate of <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>, who was last seen May 3 hitchhiking in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> said that since <PERSON> Saadon </PERSON>'s disappearance, she has wanted to avoid all contacts with <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>. `` At work, we have Arabs who clean. I ca n't look them in the eye. I hate them. They pretend they are innocent. But they hate us, too,'' she said. <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> downplayed the anti-Arab outbursts, saying they were incited by a few extremists. However, he said in an interview that if attacks on Israelis continue, authorities might no longer be able to contain the anger in the city of 60,000.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can conduct random drug testing of all officers raises `` memories of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>,'' a lawyer for the patrolmen's union said The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Friday upheld a department regulation issued in April 1986 requiring random drug testing of all department employees. `` I am deeply concerned for the health and safety of our police officers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said after the decision. `` They are human and engaged in perhaps the most stressful profession in our society. Therefore I believe that this drug testing policy is beneficial to the public as well as to the police officers in this city and in the country.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who sued the department in October 1986 to stop the testing plan, criticized the ruling `` It's an invasion of the body and an illegal seizure of body fluids without cause,'' <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON> said. `` We've always taken the position that there's no room in police work for anyone taking drugs, but we feel that police officers have the rights of every other citizen.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s 1,600-member patrolmen's union immediately vowed to appeal the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Both parties have agreed testing wo n't be imposed until all appeals are exhausted. The two-page decision cited two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings in March that upheld the government's right to require drug and alcohol tests for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> workers involved in drug interdiction and for railroad workers involved in accidents. Those verdicts said public safety outweighs constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches. In response to <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>'s suit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> upheld in May 1988 the department's right to test officers suspected of drug abuse. But <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> ruled that imposing random tests without suspicion was unconstitutional and an unreasonable search. `` These rules conjure up memories of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said no other major police departments in the country have random testing of all employees. `` There are very major implications here,'' <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. `` The broader question is how far can the government go in searching the bodies of its employees? Are blood tests and mandatory psychiatric tests next?'' Lawsuits filed by police unions also are pending against proposed drug testing in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, police departments. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began random drug testing of certain narcotics squads. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, random testing for drugs was started last October among the estimated 1,000 officers assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> began a random mandatory testing program for all its members in 1986 but suspended the program after eight months when the state attorney general advised it may be unconstitutional.

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, who helped adapt Mexican food to American taste buds by creating a crisp taco shell and smothering his enchiladas in sour cream, has died at age 81. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, considered a pioneer of Tex-Mex cuisine, died Friday, his family said. During a 37-year career at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION> Restaurant in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> was apparently the first restaurateur to put sour cream on chicken enchiladas, and thought up the idea of the hard taco shell, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who worked many years with <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> also perfected a praline recipe that kept the candy from turning too sugary and developed recipes for chili, meat taco filling and rice sauces that are standards of the Tex-Mex food business. `` He was an extraordinary individual who is very much a part of the history of Mexican food in our part of the world, and his loss will be felt dearly,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> helped the chain open more than 100 restaurants in 12 states, <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said He wrote several cookbooks, including `` The Art of Mexican Cuisine,'' which provides recipes for institutional-sized kitchens. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where his father owned and operated a chili parlor.

 Newly-arrived American soldiers went into defensive positions today around <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Nearly 1,900 soldiers from <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units, ordered in by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> following the aborting of Sunday's elections and the beating of opposition candidates, are expected this weekend to join the 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops already stationed at American bases. Fifty Marines from the 2nd Light Armored Infantry Company at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were the first to land Friday afternoon at <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They were followed by planeloads of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers from the 7th Infantry Division, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> 5th Infantry Division from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` Most of them will be living in tents,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Tight security surrounded the landing area. Journalists were kept about 200 yards from the planes, except for a few taken closer under military escort. `` Walk in a group, do n't try to break away or you will find out what kind of security we have,'' the escort told reporters. No interviews were allowed, but some soldiers spoke to journalists and waved. `` Glad to be here,'' a sergeant said as he went by. `` It was a rough flight.'' The C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy jets started landing at Howard on a typical humid, sunny Panamanian afternoon. The Marines came through a side door while their ammunition and other equipment rolled off the rear doors in large boxes. Friday's arrivals moved immediately into field positions at the perimiter of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. `` We are here at the decision of the president to provide support for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a brigade commander in the 7th Light Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a contingent commander. There was no official reaction Friday from Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whom the <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> government and international obervers accused of annulling Sunday's election to keep the opposition from assuming power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is commander of the 15,000-strong Panamanian Defense Forces and the country's de facto ruler.

 A Radcliffe undergraduate has charged that a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law student forced her to participate in pornographic videos and raped her, but a lawyer for the accused said the woman was a consenting partner. The second-year law student who is president of the 25-member <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entrepreneurs </ORGANIZATION> also is accused of using that group for sex, forcing some members to undress in front of cameras. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Samoluk </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office, said Friday that investigators had been in touch with the alleged victim and were looking into the matter. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richburg </PERSON>, 24, also a student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and member of the entrepreneurs society, said she was angered by the depiction of the group as a `` sex ring.'' <PERSON> Richburg </PERSON> said she knew of no one who was coerced into videotaped sexual activities. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> said internal hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> began Friday. The board takes testimony, collects evidence and can recommend disciplinary measures, <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> said, but he would n't specify what action might be taken against the student. The male student's lawyer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideonse </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, described the incident as the unfortunate outcome of a broken relationship. He said his client was `` devastated'' by publicity over the alleged incident. He said his client and the woman were involved from April 1988 until last fall and described the tapes as the result of `` private, consensual activity.'' `` The notion that there's a ring of some sort is garbage,'' said <PERSON> Gideonse </PERSON>. `` It's not a lurid, widespread kind of thing. People do things in the privacy of their own home and at some point somebody changes their mind.'' <PERSON> Gideonse </PERSON> said that in addition to his client and the female student, there was only one other participant in the tapes, a male <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student who recently appeared on the <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> talk show as part of a panel of `` professional virgins.'' `` There was no rape and there was no extortion,'' <PERSON> Gideonse </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials began investigating after the Radcliffe student filed a report last December with campus police accusing the law student of rape when she demanded that he erase videotapes showing her and others involved in sexual acts, <PERSON> Gideonse </PERSON> said. The woman said she went to the law student's apartment Dec. 11 to persuade him to erase the videotapes. She claimed he reacted by raping her, and demanded money or sexual favors in return for destroying the tapes, officials said.

 Park rangers and volunteers searched the summit of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> for a missing climber whose partner was found dead just below the 14,410-foot summit. Four search parties totaling 21 people were spending the night on the mountain after having been flown in by helicopter, said <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON>, a Mount Rainier National Park ranger. <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> identified the dead man as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was one four people climbing the mountain together. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, was missing, he said. If <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON> can not be found today, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said, `` I would say it looks pretty grim.'' Their companions, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duin </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, 27, both of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, descended from the peak and notified authorities Thursday. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>'s body was found by <PERSON> Duin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> as they headed upward about 400 feet below Liberty Cap, one of three summits around the crater of the dormant volcano, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. The body was flown off the mountain Friday, he said. The two survivors searched the summit area and the eastern side of the peak for the missing man before descending to the <LOCATION> Ipsut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> campground to report the death. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> had taken off his parka and tied it to his skis and probably died of hypothermia. The parka was still tied to the skis when he was found. <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON> apparently climbed toward the summit, thinking the other two climbers were ahead. `` He left his pack behind with the body,'' <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know what he took out of it,'' the ranger added. `` He did n't have a lot with him besides the clothes on his back.'' The four climbers, all of whom had skis for the descent down snow-covered glaciers, started their climb Sunday, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. `` It -LRB- the search -RRB- looks less fruitful as we continue, but you never know,'' he said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON> -RRB- was a strong climber.''

<HEAD>Exxon, Coast Guard Hope To Ensure Clean Halibut Season At Oil Spill

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Exxon and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> planned more than a dozen flights over the site of the nation's worst oil spill to chart routes for fishing boats and ensure a clean start to the halibut season. The company and government officials also planned to test oil-thinning chemicals on crude-caked beaches. Some environmentalists criticized the move, but officials said it was necessary because seven weeks of washing and scrubbing by thousands of cleanup workers had proven ineffective. Authorities also reported that a Soviet skimmer ship that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> dropped from the cleanup effort earlier this week had been rehired for standby duty near the entrance of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s senior officer in the spill zone, ordered eight flights Saturday and eight more on Sunday over fishing grounds in and around the sound. The fishing industry had sought the flights as a means of allaying consumers' concerns of oil-tainted halibut. The halibut season begins Monday, and the area's annual harvest has been estimated at $ 85 million. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground on March 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of crude, the herring season has been canceled in the sound. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> also ordered test-sprays of chemical dispersants on the beaches of <LOCATION> Ingot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the sound on Monday. The chemicals are designed to thin the hardened oil. `` It creates more of a hazard than it's worth,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, it seems a pretty risky thing to try. There are so many important pupping areas for harbor seals. This is not the right time to do it.'' Earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly after the spill. In releasing the Soviet ship <PERSON> Vaidogubsky </PERSON> earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had blamed hardened oil for jamming the skimmer's pumps and rendering it ineffective. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> hired the 11,400-ton vessel under a $ 15,000-a-day contract through the end of May, executives for the company that operates the trans-Alaska pipeline said. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> hired the craft for `` standby backup'' at the entrance to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. He said the vessel `` would provide extra protection'' in case of another spill. Meanwhile, Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> signed legislation to create a state commission to investigate the Exxon Valdez spill and to impose tougher spill fines. The law would increase fines for spills caused by gross negligence to as much as $ 50 a gallon or a maximum of $ 500 million from $ 10 a gallon or $ 100 million. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> also signed a bill that imposes stricter liability laws on companies responsible for oil and hazardous material spills. The `` spill bills'' were the first to become law since the Exxon Valdez ran aground. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has hearings scheduled next week in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to investigate the cause of the accident. The fired skipper of the tanker, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, faces trial June 20 in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on charges that include operating the vessel while intoxicated. An executive at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> may have felt pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to sail late at night on March 23 despite the presence of icebergs in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, according to a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. `` If <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> had n't pulled out of <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> at 10, after he finished loading at 8, <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> would have been on the phone to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> office,'' said the manager, whom the newspaper did n't identify. `` In a few minutes, the ship's satellite phone would have rung, telling <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> to get his ship out of there He'd have to come up with a real good reason to stay. The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen refused to comment on the report.

<HEAD>Crowd Rampages Through Second City in Turkmenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 250 protesters with economic and ethnic demands rampaged through streets of a city near the Iranian border, setting fire to shops and pelting police with stones, a newspaper reported. The May 9 riot in <LOCATION> Nebit-Dag </LOCATION>, a western city in the republic of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, followed a rampage in the republic's capital <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION> on May 1 in which more than 100 young people were arrested. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Friday that about 50 people had been arrested in <LOCATION> Nebit-Dag </LOCATION>, and that two policemen had been injured by the crowd. The crowd overwhelmed the city's small police force, which had to call in reinforcements, said N.S. <PERSON> Radzhabov </PERSON>, head of the local <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> office. `` All of two weeks ago you could boldly say about <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> that it was one of the quietest regions of our country,'' the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been hit by unrest in many of its 15 republics, homelands for some of its more than 100 ethnic groups. But <PERSON> Radzhabov </PERSON> told the paper that a crowd of mostly Turkmen aged 16-40 gathered in the center of <LOCATION> Nebit-Dag </LOCATION>, and rebuffed police who tried to talk to them. `` We tried to quiet the people, but they started throwing stones,'' he said. `` The crowd split into two, each of which moved down streets of the city, demolishing and setting fire to cooperative cafes and stalls.'' The paper said that like the crowd in <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION>, they expressed anger at cooperatives, the small private businesses that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has fostered to fill gaps in goods and services provided by the state economy. But the crowd in the Nebit-Dag also turned some of its wrath on Armenians, the paper said. Armenians are involved in a bitter dispute with Azerbaijanis over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region. Armenians are traditionally Christian. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, both bordering <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are on opposite sides of the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and are traditionally Moslem. Many Soviets are suspicious that cooperatives are interested only in quick profits and are havens for organized crime. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said May 3 that the <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION> crowd was angered by high prices of cooperatives, and the low quality of goods and services. <PERSON> Radzhabov </PERSON> said their main complaint was about cooperatives, and that the crowd `` shouted slogans directed at people of Armenian nationality.'' The paper said that unhappiness with traders at <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>'s markets might be the fault of local merchants who buy up goods from <LOCATION> Tadzhiks </LOCATION>, Uzbeks, Armenians and others as soon as they arrive in <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>

 The government is testing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil tankers at border entry points for solvents, PCBs, waste oil and other impurities used by traffickers to dilute shipments and boost profits, officials and news reports said. Environment Minister <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> announced Friday that as part of a plan to stem the alleged tide of contaminated fuel shipped from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only 50 of the 175 border crossings will be open to oil tankers. <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> said the change will allow closer inspection of imported fuels to ensure they are not tainted with PCBs or other chemicals that can produce cancer-causing furans and dioxins when burned. The minister said inspection teams have begun taking samples from tanker trucks at major U.S.-Canada border crossings and that no contaminants have been found in 12 samples analyzed so far. An Environment <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> official said consumers would not have to stop driving their cars or turn off their furnaces because of fears of tainted fuel. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said if the toxic wastes and solvents were mixed with fuel, the levels would not be high enough to have a health impact. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used mainly as a coolant in electrical transformers but have been banned in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of health concerns. The political opposition however continued to insist the border action by the Conservative government would do little good. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, executive vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the testing and closing of border crossings to the shipments will cost Canadian consumers up to $ 500 million a year. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday that the solvents were mixed secretly into fuels the past four years, sold to customers in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and taken across the border for sale in the Canadian provinces of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. The report in the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail quoted unidentifed law enforcement sources and participants in what it said was lucrative trafficking. It said the shipments of altered gasoline, diesel and industrial heating fuel originated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The Globe and Mail reported Friday at least 2.6 million gallons of toxic solvents were shipped to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sarnia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and blended into gasoline over a two-year period. Some of the tainted gasoline came back to <LOCATION> Sarnia </LOCATION> and was sold in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON> also announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> will lead a task force investigating the report that millions of gallons of imported fuel were contaminated by the toxic wastes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governors from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> state visiting <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday were asked repeatedly at their public appearances about the report. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said the news was to be taken seriously, but `` it's something that's basically news to us.'' The governors said state environmental officials would discuss the issue at a summer meeting.

<HEAD>Connecticut Governor's Office Hit With Fax Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Businessmen opposed to a bill banning unsolicited facsimile advertising thought it natural to lobby the governor by fax, but they may have sent the wrong message by jamming his machine for hours. `` You could not have done a better job of bringing home the problem adressed in the bill that you oppose,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Monagan </PERSON>, an aide to Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, wrote Thursday in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Users </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee opposes a bill awaiting <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s signature that would prohibit them from marketing their products by facsimile machine without first obtaining the permission of the recipient. Violators would face a $ 200 fine. In a campaign apparently organized by the committee, dozens of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> businesses sent <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s office a form letter _ by fax _ arguing against the fax ban beginning Thursday. The letter argued it would cost the average company $ 6,000 a year to obtain permission before sending facsimile messages. The stream of messages was so constant _ 40 came in before 10 a.m. _ that the governor's office turned off the fax machine Thursday. When they turned it back on Friday, the messages still were pouring in. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandberg </PERSON>, said the governor still has n't decided whether he will sign the bill. But aides said the persistent lobbying campaign proved how annoying unwanted messages can be. The inconvenience was compounded because the governor's office was unable to use its facsimile machine to receive information about spring flooding around the state. In his letter, <PERSON> Monagan </PERSON> urged the California-based fax users committee to come up with `` a different and more effective way of getting your message across.'' The committee does n't have a listed telephone number, so <PERSON> Monagan </PERSON> did the logical thing. He transmitted the letter to the committee's fax line A facsimile message sent by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Users </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to a telephone number listed on the committee's documents went unanswered Friday

 The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will `` try to launch a blitzkrieg against Phnom Penh'' after Vietnamese troops withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, 67, told reporters he was `` sure'' civil war would erupt in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the pullout that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to complete by Sept. 30. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would seek a quick victory, before countries start recognizing the Vietnamese-installed government as the nation's legitimate rulers, he said. The prince said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, with an estimated 40,000 guerrillas and enough weapons for 120,000 fighters, would go to battle unless they are included in a provisional government. He said the provisional government should include the Vietnamese-installed government and the guerrilla coalition comprising the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s forces and the anti-communist forces of former Premier Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, was `` absolutely wrong'' to believe that an alliance between <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> would bring peace to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` We have to acknowledge the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ... are certainly very bad people, very cruel. They are even criminals, but they are there,'' he said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978, ousted the radical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> that had ruled the country since the spring of 1975 and set up another communist government. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> came to power by defeating the U.S.-backed Cambodian government. During its brief rule up to 2 million Cambodians were killed in purges or died of starvation. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> on Friday dismissed calls for an immediate truce as a trick it said the Vietnamese also used during the war with the Americans to prepare for a military offensive. A text of the broadcast was seen today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> recently proposed a cease-fire before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout, and the Vietnamese-installed government and the non-communist guerrilla groups have agreed The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rejected the proposal on Monday. In Friday's broadcast it said that before a truce, there first must be: _ a <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> pullout under international supervision _ supervision of the withdrawal in strategic areas of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> _ supervision of the cease-fire _ supervision of the disarming of all sides, and _ reduction of all forces to a level to be agreed upon by all sides `` Otherwise, this cease-fire will be a deception and a lie and would be most dangerous,'' it said.

 Film producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has been warned he could face contempt of court charges for refusing to testify in a 6-year-old murder case linked to the movie `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' At a preliminary hearing Friday, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> repeatedly cited his Fifth Amendment right in refusing to answer a prosecutor's questions Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and his attorney to return to court Monday to resume a hearing into the 1983 murder of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theatrical producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>.

Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> has refused to rule out <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> as a suspect and has refused to offer him immunity from prosecution for his testimony. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the former head of production at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> who produced `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>'' and `` The Godfather,'' gave only his name at the hearing. After he refused to answer a string of unanswered questions, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> conferred with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> in her chambers. She then ruled that <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> must answer the prosecutor's questions when the hearing resumes. A former <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> confidante and reputed drug dealer, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Delayne </PERSON> `` Laynie'' <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, is charged with the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> murder along with three former <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> bodyguards, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>.

Actor <PERSON> Demond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, former star of `` Sanford and Son,'' was one of the last to see <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> alive and is expected to be a key witness. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, a flamboyant impresario who made his money from rock and vaudeville shows and lived in a 72-room mansion on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, sought to become a movie mogul through `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' His murder remained a mystery until last year when <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s former brother-in-law, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>, came forward with information Ryder headed <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s private security army.

 A man shot his wife and two sons to death in their beds and then spent several days locked in the house with his 9-year-old daughter before turning a handgun on her and himself, authorities said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fager </PERSON>, 34, apparently was distraught over being unemployed several months, state police Sgt. <PERSON> Dallard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tackett </PERSON> said Friday. Relatives and police broke into the house and found the bodies Thursday after school authorities reported not seeing the children since May 3. The bodies of <PERSON> Fager </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Roxane </PERSON>, 31; and their children, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 11; and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, 9; were found in bed in the family's one-story home.

Autopsies showed <PERSON> Fager </PERSON> and his daughter died within 24 hours of the discovery of the bodies, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fager </PERSON> and the two sons had been dead three or four days. A handgun was found near <PERSON> Fager </PERSON>'s body, police said. There were no signs of forced entry or struggle, and <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> said there was no evidence of molestation. Mrs. <PERSON> Fager </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Waymire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said the couple moved to <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> about four years ago. `` We did n't have any inkling that this would occur,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Waymire </PERSON> said.

 Soldiers aided by a former communist rebel have found three mass graves where the remains of scores of people killed by guerrillas are believed buried, a military spokesman said today. On strife-torn <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas holding eight government militiamen said today they will release their captives if the military would stop their operation against them. Col. <PERSON> Tranquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspiras </PERSON> said the graves, in two provinces just south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, are believed to contain about the bodies of about 100 people killed by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in a purge of suspected military spies in their ranks following a series of arrests of ranking rebel leaders last year. `` We have discovered communist killing fields,'' <PERSON> Aspiras </PERSON> said. `` These atrocities have been left unreported because of the secrecy of the killings. The murders must be unmasked.'' Reporters who accompanied the soldiers said they counted 28 bodies, including six women, in the mass grave in the town of <LOCATION> Kavinti </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> province. Most of the remains were bones but some still had flesh, indicating they were killed recently. <PERSON> Aspiras </PERSON> said digging was hampered by rough terrain, and soldiers were still clearing the area of trees to allow helicopters to deliver supplies and additional men. A former rebel who surrendered in January, <PERSON> Severino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranoda </PERSON>, disclosed the location of the graves, <PERSON> Aspiras </PERSON> said. The soldiers were preparing to move on to two other mass grave sites in nearby <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province. Police said 10 government militiamen were captured Wednesday by rebels posing as soldiers in <LOCATION> Mandug </LOCATION> district on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> city, about 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The rebels released two who reported the incident to authorities, said police Lt. <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Corral </PERSON>. <PERSON> Corral </PERSON> said the rebels also took five M-14 rifles and a two-way radio from the militiamen. In a statement, the rebels they would release their captives if the military stops its offensive in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> and two nearby provinces because the operation was forcing civilians to evacuate. It did not say how many people were forced to flee their homes. The rebels also said military should allow relief agencies, church groups and reporters into the `` militarized'' areas. The communists have been fighting the government for 20 years.

<HEAD>Antiques Dealer Found Innocent After Fourth Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It took eight years and four murder trials, but a jury finally agreed with what an antiques dealer had said all along: he killed a 21-year-old man in self-defense, not in a jealous rage. `` After eight years of mental, physical and financial torture, it feels good that justice finally has been served,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said after his acquittal Friday. The 58-year-old <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> dealer had been convicted twice in the May 2, 1981, slaying of <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON>, but those verdicts were overturned on appeal. A third trial ended in a hung jury. The fourth trial was moved to <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> at the defense's request, and defense attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiler </PERSON> credited the change for the verdict. `` I knew we had to get it out of <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. That's the key,'' he said. `` I'm not surprised. I'm delighted,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> concurred. `` There's a difference. ... This jury up here was fair and square, and so was the judge. These people knew how to read between the lines. Prosecutors alleged <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was having a homosexual affair with <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> and shot him in a jealous frenzy, then arranged the scene to make it appear to be self-defense. <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> was shot three times in the study of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' home. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> admitted the shooting but said he shot only after <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> fired at him first during an argument. District Attorney <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he accepted the verdict. `` It is not my practice to second-guess jurors,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was prominent in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> society as an art expert, restorer of old homes and historic preservationist. He had hired <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> to work around his home, a restored 1860s mansion. On Thursday, a former girlfriend of <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> testified that he drank too much, used drugs, did n't want to work and was hostile toward <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blivens </PERSON> told prosecutors <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> had a room in <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' house and lived there <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had testified that <PERSON> Hansford </PERSON> was a `` house guest'' but did not live with him. In closing arguments Friday, <PERSON> Seiler </PERSON> contended the prosecution's case was based on a `` ridiculous theory. `` ` Murder, She Wrote' has n't come up with the bizarre things they've dreamed of,'' he said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television series.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> left the capital today after accusing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of using blackmail and threats against the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from joining the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who arrived for talks with President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> on prospects for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, told a news conference late Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threats resulted in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s membership bid being rejected earlier that day. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Non-Aligned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a grouping of Third World nations that is an alternative to the East and West power blocs. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, considered by <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> to be an independent state, is a member of the movement. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> held talks behind closed doors on proposals drafted by the 101-member Non-Aligned Movement for an end to the 17-month Palestinian uprising in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories, officials said. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> was at <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to see <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> off today. Officials did not immediately know his destination. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prodding, the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> deferred until next year a decision on whether to admit the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s self-proclaimed state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> as its 167th member After Friday's vote by the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> annual assembly in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> vowed to continue its campaign for membership in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies. The assembly voted 83-47 in a secret ballot Friday in favor of a resolution co-sponsored by nine Western and Third World countries to defer the bid. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which threatens to withdraw funding to any <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that admits <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> state as a member, hailed the assembly's decision. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the vote `` rejected the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to politicize WHO's important work.'' Without elaborating, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of using `` pressure, blackmail and threats'' against the WHO. In <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of blocking efforts toward <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, saying all the initiatives were being made by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But later, at a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> dinner, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he was confident ongoing efforts toward peace would succeed. `` The alternative would be total destruction,'' he said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was given a formal welcome usually reserved for visiting heads of state when he arrived Friday from neighboring <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. It was <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> since his organization's declaration of independence in November He had previously been in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> on three occasions.

<TEXT>
 Riot police with truncheons and shields held back thousands of protesters denouncing the death of a student who dissidents claim was killed by police. Students and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> residents pushed and shoved riot police guarding a square in front the provincial government building as speakers denounced the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Troopers rushed out with truncheons and shields, hitting and kicking the protesters, to stop them from reaching the government building. But police did not prevent about 10,000 people from holding a rally in the square in front of the building in this provincial capital 170 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. There were no immediate reports of injuries and arrests. Protesters cheered and applauded as their leaders called for a nationwide movement to topple <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and expel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Speakers accused <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> of attempting to impose authoritarian rule and the crowd responded with chants of `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' Earlier, demonstrators shoved riot troopers blocking the way as about 15,000 people tried to march to the city center to denounce the death of radical student <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-kyu </PERSON>, whose body was found Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the government said today it has protested to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for `` irresponsible remarks'' over <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death, which it said were made publicly Friday by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Assistant Foreign Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-bin </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official termed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death a `` deplorable event and atrocious act'' and said `` we hope the murderers will be exposed and severly punished.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> that the remarks `` lack a sense of responsibility and could affect the investigation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> did not return telephone calls inquiring about the comments. The crowd cheered as dissident leaders claimed police interrogators tortured <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to death. `` This barbarous act was committed by the suppressive security forces to suppress the national democratic movement,'' claimed dissident leader <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-pyo </PERSON>. Dissidents claiming a government probe is trying to cover up the incident are demanding a full and independent investigation into his death and punishment of police officers allegedly involved. Police have denied any official involvement in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death. Doctors said an initial autopsy failed to determine the cause of death. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was being hunted by police for pro-North Korean articles and other political activities. He had spent almost two years in jail for anti-government activities. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death could provoke widespread protests in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, especially since it came one week before the anniversary of a 1980 anti-government uprising in the city in which at least 192 people died. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been rocked by violent anti-government protests and strikes in recent months, but radical groups have little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has ordered a series of crackdowns to stop the dissident movement.

 An elderly British citizen disappeared in Syrian-controlled Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and is feared kidnapped, his wife said today. A previously unknown group issued a claim of responsibility. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 83, a former pilot with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s national airline, left his apartment on foot at 11 a.m. Friday and headed for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> about 12 blocks away, said his wife, Sunny. Employees at the bank say he never got there. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> confirmed in a statement that <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> squadron leader, has disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A group calling itself The <ORGANIZATION> Cells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> issued a claim of responsibility in a statement handwritten in Arabic and delivered Friday to a Western news agency. The group did not mention the name of the Briton, but demanded the release of comrades jailed in connection with the killing of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> cartoonist in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1987. An editor at the news agency, requesting anonymity, said the agency did not report the claim because there were no indications then that a Briton was missing. The statement said: `` We declare our readiness to immediately release the captive if the British government announces the beginning of a fair trial for our comrades. `` We ask the British government to release our comrades detained without evidence on charge of assassinating comrade <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ali </PERSON>,'' it said. <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Adhami </PERSON>, died Aug. 30, 1987, from wounds he suffered five weeks earlier when a lone asassin shot him outside the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> offices of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas. An investigation was launched into the killing, but it was not known if any arrests have been made. The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed the Palestinian cartoonist `` died at the hands of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service -RRB- <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> in cooperation with the British intelligence to drive a wedge and deepen differences within <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ranks.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> is a retired <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilot who later worked for <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s national airliner. `` I do n't know for sure if he's been kidnapped, but I presume so,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. A friend of <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he saw the missing Briton at about 11:15 a.m. Friday near the bank. `` I remember he had blue trousers and was walking slowly in the direction of the bank,'' the friend said. An employee at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said he did not arrive. After his retirement in the early 1960s, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> worked for 10 years as a bartender at the Pickwick Pub in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> recently appeared in a program on foreigners living in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> screened by the state television. Asked why she and her husband continued to live in this kidnap-plagued city, Mrs. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said: `` We've been living here for a long, long time. We feel this is our home. We're not going to leave.'' The suspected abduction comes after <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, urged Palestinians on May 5 to launch a worldwide campaign of terror against Britons, Americans and French. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> later said his remarks were misinterpreted. On May 4, three West German relief workers were captured in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and two were released 10 hours later. The third, <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Quint </PERSON>, is being held by unidentified kidnappers who are demanding lenient sentences or freedom for prominent Palestinian terrorists, the other two hostages said. No direct claim of responsibility is known to have been received in that case. Fifteen other Western hostages are believed held by Moslem fundamentalists, most of them loyal to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic government in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The hostages include four Britons, nine Americans, a Belgian and an Italian. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985. Relations between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were severed in February after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued an edict calling on Moslems to kill British writer <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Many Moslems believe <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam.

 About 1,000 Chinese students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square today to press for democratic reforms, and student leaders said the government agreed to discuss their demands. Student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said students still may be in the square on Monday when Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrives for the first Sino-Soviet summit in three decades. `` As for whether we will disrupt Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that depends on the government,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. He said he hoped <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would tell Chinese leaders about his `` good experience'' in political reform. However, he said he did n't expect the students to have a chance to talk to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> He added, `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a state affair. I'm sure he wo n't come to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to get involved in Chinese politics.'' Student leaders also said that on Friday night, in a major concession, the government agreed to hold talks with an independent student group on the student demands for sweeping democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. `` But they made certain conditions,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaohua </PERSON>, a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` They said the number of -LRB- student -RRB- delegates could not exceed 20'' and reporters would be allowed to issue only partial reports on the talks. The students are demanding that the talks be broadcast in full. Miss <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said the students were not satisfied with the offer. The offer nevetheless is a major concession because the government previously had insisted that all talks be held through government-sponsored student unions. Thousands of passers-by crowded the square for a look at the protest, which marked the eighth time students have marched to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> since they began a campaign for political change on April 15. Students from more than a dozen schools sat in neat rows on the vast square, the symbolic center of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Some had canteens of water, others sat on blankets. Several read the works of Indian leader <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, famed for his fasting and non-violent opposition to British colonial rule. About three rows of student surrounded the strikers, protecting them from onlookers. Meanwhile, another group of students went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and delivered an open letter in Russian inviting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to speak at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Student leader <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jun </PERSON> said students had collected 6,000 signatures. Emerging from the embassy, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said the Soviets told him they would give the letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but that his schedule was very tight. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day visit, which begins Monday, will mark the first time a Soviet leader has come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 30 years. Students also are planning a demonstration to `` welcome'' the Soviet president on Monday. In a related matter, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships scheduled to make a port call at <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Friday, one day after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to visit the city. Earlier, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said the ships would arrive on Thursday. Foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said the Soviet side was unhappy about the naval visit, which the Soviets saw as a signal by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that better Sino-Soviet relations would not influence <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strong links with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state law that requires pregnant teen-agers to have the consent of a parent or a judge before getting an abortion has been called `` constitutionally infirm'' by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> appeals court. The <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> agreed with Lake Circuit Judge <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> who ruled May 4 that the abortion-consent law was unconstitutionally vague. The appeals court also said in its ruling Friday that the state law failed to protect the privacy of minors guaranteed under <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision which made abortion legal. Rulings by district courts of appeal are binding statewide unless _ as often happens in controversial cases _ another state appeals court decides to take a similar case and reaches a different decision, said <ORGANIZATION> Volusia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Then, for the decision to apply statewide, it would have to be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court, in a 2-1 ruling, sent the case back to <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> with the order that he dismiss the petition filed by a 15-year-old pregnant teen-ager who had sought his permission for an abortion. `` The decision to terminate the pregnancy is up to -LRB- the girl -RRB- and her physician without state regulation,'' the court ruled. The state law was so vague, the ruling said, that there was `` a clear danger that trial judges would render a decision on the basis of their own moral, religious or political beliefs regarding abortion.'' Judge <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, who issued a two-paragraph dissent, said the court should send the issue to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as requested by Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>. The law approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last year requires single girls under age 18 to get permission from a parent, guardian or judge before obtaining an abortion. It says judges can grant approval if they decide the girl is sufficiently mature to make the decision, if consent is being unreasonably withheld by a parent or guardian, or if the girl fears emotional or physical abuse if she tells her parents.

<TEXT>
 The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries today voted to readmit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, 10 years after <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s membership was suspended for signing a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> Oil Minister said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> declined to say whether the vote was unanimous, but sources said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> cast a negative ballot. The vote, a step by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> back into the Arab fold, came at a meeting of 10 <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the 11th member of the Kuwait-based organization. Before the meeting, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources called <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s reinstatement a `` foregone conclusion.'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshouki </PERSON>, indicated <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> opposed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION>, but would abide by majority decision. `` We will not pull out,'' <PERSON> Shakshouki </PERSON> said. He said, however, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> would continue to oppose <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> organizations `` as long as the causes of its suspension do not vanish.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> lost its place in all Arab institutions after its membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> was suspended in 1979 for signing the Camp David Accords with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has still not been reinstated by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, but that move is expected at a May 23-24 Arab summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have tried to block <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to Arab organizations. But the Syrians have in recent months moderated their stand against <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Opening the meeting, <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' oil minister, called for restoring <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> family will remain incomplete as long as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> remains outside,'' he declared. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is a mother, sister and daughter of the Arab nation ... we hope this meeting will handle the question.'' <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> sources said the organization's charter stipulates that two-thirds of the members and two-thirds of the founders must vote for membership to be restored. <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION>, was founded in 1968 by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a forum for coordinating Arab oil policies. The other members are <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Seven countries double as members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

 A lawyer handling a paternity suit against <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> says he's ready to start negotiating support payments after releasing blood tests indicating the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> mayor fathered a 6-year-old boy. `` Paternity is practically proved, with that one iota of possibility that he's not -LRB- the father -RRB-. And I think that in a court of law, this would be acceptable evidence to prove that he is,'' <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said Friday. Results from <LOCATION> Edward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sparrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> show a 99.9999 percent likelihood that <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 70, fathered <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loving </PERSON>. The boy lives with his mother, <PERSON> Annivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. A second set of tests, analyzed at the <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> at the request of Young's attorneys, showed a 99.999 percent likelihood the mayor is the father <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>, 34, a former <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> assistant director of public works, took a job as public works director in <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION> shortly before filing her suit in January. She was out of the office on business Friday and unavailable for comment, her secretary said. Young was vacationing Friday and could not be reached. `` Until all institutions have reported, and particularly until the DNA fingerprinting is reported, the attorneys for Mayor <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will have no further comment,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Charfoos </PERSON>, said in a written statement. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said further action is unlikely pending results of similar blood tests by <ORGANIZATION> Cellmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION>, Md. Those tests also were requested by <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s attorneys, he said. Tests to determine paternity included DNA analysis and at least 14 other comparisons of the blood samples. <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> seeks unspecified child support, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. She also wants Young to exercise visitation rights, he said. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who has been married and divorced twice, to acknowledge paternity when all the results are in, clearing the way to negotiate child-support payments. <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> said she had a relationship with Young from 1980-87. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> has released snapshots of Young holding <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>'s baby. The attorney said the child is aware that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has been alleged to be his father. `` He was asked here in my office who his dad was and he said ` <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. `` But he kind of said it very sheepishly because it was maybe something that he was told not to go around saying.'' Young is expected to seek his fifth term as mayor of the nation's sixth-largest city later this year, and some supporters have alleged the suit was filed for political reasons.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, highly influential in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has condemned strongman leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and called on his soldiers to quit terrorizing residents. Police maintained roadblocks in sections of the capital early today, and groups of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen attended discotheques despite strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advice to remain on military bases. The church, in an unusually stern statement Friday, assailed last Sunday's elections as fraud-ridden and appealed to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters who beat the opposition candidates with pipes, sticks and rubber whips to act with moral restraint. Latin American leaders also intensified efforts to negotiate an end to the crisis as hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops soldiers in by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to protect Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or working at the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> arrived at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. Nearly 1,900 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers are expected to arrive over the next week. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also urged the government to `` respect the general will of the people.'' The request came in a letter from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jumpei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, about election irregulaties. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> remain out of sight. Neither has been seen in public or made a statement in a week. The government, blaming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in part for interferring in internal affairs, nullified an election in which international observers said opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was beating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s handpicked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, 3-to-1. No new elections have been scheduled. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, a leader in the regional <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> effort and a vocal opponent of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, recalled its ambassador Friday, following similar moves by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, during an interview, offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> asylum in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The paper provided no further details on the offer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power since he was indicted on drug-trafficking charges last year in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, denies the charges <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has successfully weathered political and economic turmoil since Febrary 1988, when he engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the general was indicted. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> despite the installation of <LOCATION> Solis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> and has hit <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with economic sanctions that created cash shortages, caused capital flight and contributed to a decline of its international banking business. On Friday, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> postponed classes for its 600,000 school children and 60,000 university students, citing actions by the `` deranged administration of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Government television appealed for calm while a government-controlled newspaper named <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` Bum of the Day.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> accepted <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s proposal to discuss the Panamanian crisis on Wednesday. Approval came after a stormy two-hour meeting. But <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s representative, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, blasted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions, saying, `` We will not bow to the colossus of the north.'' In a sharp break from the government, the Church in this predominately <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nation of 2.2 million assailed the electoral process and civil unrest. `` What moral justification can there be for terrorizing the population with gangs feeding on hate and a false nationalism?'' the statement said. The statement and the American decision to add reinforcements to the 10,000-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force were inspired at least in part by a Wednesday attack by thugs on <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice presidential running mates. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> remained hospitalized Friday but was described to be in good spirits. C-141 and C-5A jets, the largest in the American arsenal, landed at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> about every half hour with <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops, vehicles and other equipment. A Marine sergeant said, `` We're glad to be here.'' Arriving troops were not permitted to be interviewed. About 3,000 dependents of American military and embassy personnel and civilian military employees have moved onto military bases as have an estimated 160 Panamanians seeking refuge. The Southern Command canceled all unofficial off-base activities and urged military personnel to stay out of public areas. There has been no official Panamanian reaction to the increase in troops, which is permitted under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty that will give the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

<HEAD>Soviet Pullout from Czechoslovakia Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today began a partial withdrawal of soldiers and tanks stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It was the first pullout of permanent Soviet forces since a 1968 invasion to crush Communist-led reform. A 6 -LCB- - mile column of Soviet army vehicles headed home from the north Moravian city of <LOCATION> Olomouc </LOCATION>, according to state-run media A brief ceremony sponsored by local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials marked the departure. The reports did not say how many soldiers and tanks were in the procession. The partial withdrawal of Soviet soldiers was announced in December by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as part of an overall plan to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by half a million men by 1991. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promised withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by 1991 began last month with the much publicized departure of 31 T-64 tanks from a base in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Soviet troops and tanks have also begun to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Until <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> launched the short-lived `` Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had no troops or tanks permanently stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Soviet and other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troops and tanks first entered the country for lengthy maneuvers in mid-1968 in a sign of increasing nervousness among <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> allies over <ORGANIZATION> Dubcek </ORGANIZATION>'s reforms The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces withdrew to just over the Czechoslovak border in July 1968, but returned Aug. 20. The invasion crushed reforms and led to the expulsion of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and nearly 500,000 others from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. According to Western estimates, the Soviets have about 80,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Czechoslovak chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON>, said in February the Soviets will withdraw 5,300 soldiers, 708 tanks and 20 planes by the end of 1990. Four battalions numbering some 1,500 men will be withdrawn this year.

 A 24-year-old woman told a judge that she tried to flee a drug cult after its leader, her ex-boyfriend, admitted killing people on a ranch near the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> and two other cult members were arraigned Friday on murder charges in the killing of their leader, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, and his closest associate. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, linked to the deaths of 15 people at a ranch near the border city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> in April, died during a police manhunt when he reputedly ordered his minions to kill him as they holed up in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Although Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> was one of the suspects in the 15 earlier deaths, she has not been charged in those crimes. Five other people were arrested in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> last month in connection with the earlier killings. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> was arraigned on two counts of murder, criminal association and resisting arrest. Also arraigned on murder and other charges were <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Orea </PERSON>. Dressed in a prison uniform and standing behind bars in a chamber off the courtroom, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> denied she was involved in <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s death. She shook her head `` No'' when an official of the 58th <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, reading from a transcript of her statements during interrogation, said she urged <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> to obey when <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, ordered himself and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> killed to avoid capture. `` Everyone was yelling'' when police closed in, she said. `` I was ... extremely nervous. What I yelled to <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> was that they stop shooting, that they -LRB- the police -RRB- were going to kill all of us,'' she told the court. `` I never gave orders to kill <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON>,'' she said. At the end of the proceedings, Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyar </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON>, told the court there was no evidence to support the first two charges. He did not comment on the third. She also testified that <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON>, a veteran police officer who allegedly killed his wife and another woman before shooting himself on Sept. 17, was described by <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> as his `` godson.'' Ventura was <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since early 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> is a Paris-based organization that coordinates police actions against international criminals. Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> has specified that she practiced `` Christian Santeria,'' which she said did not include human sacrifices. However, she described rituals involving sacrificial killings of animals. `` The way I found out about the deaths and everything that happened -LRB- at the ranch -RRB- was when the bodies were shown on television,'' she said. She said it was then that <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> told her how they were killed. She said four victims, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> college student <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, were human sacrifices. The others, she said, were killed over drugs, money or other disputes. She said she wanted to flee after group members fled to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when the bodies were found, but said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> told her: `` You wo n't leave here any way but dead since you are a loose cannon.'' She said she was <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s girlfriend for about a month in September 1987. Judge <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> has until Monday to rule there is sufficient evidence to presume guilt or drop the charges. The three are not eligible for bond. If he orders them held, he then has a year in which to sentence them or find them innocent.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s would-be president-elect, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed recovering from an attack by thugs at a post-election political rally. It was an unlikely spot for <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, a portly, affable lawyer and former law professor who headed the opposition ticket in Sunday's presidential elections Supporters on Friday gave him an impromptu birthday party there. The government declared itself ahead when it stopped the vote and nullified the election Wednesday, blaming, among other things, American interference. Exit polls showed <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice presidential candidates with an edge of about 3-1. On Wednesday, men wearing T-shirts of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` Dignity Battalions'' battered <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two presidential candidates in a bloody street scene captured by foreign cameras, sending <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> to the hospital. `` They were not battalions and they have no dignity,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said earlier in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied guayabera, a short-sleeved smock-type shirt favored by many Latins. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, a veteran member of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, ran very much in the shadow of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s grand old man of the opposition, <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, who died last summer in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> died and used to speak, almost dreamily, of the day when <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> would return `` as a sign of providence'' to lead the country. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> lost control of the party in December to <PERSON> Hildebrando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicosia </PERSON>, who ran as a third-party candidate and finished third. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> adopted <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and the coalition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> ran him for president. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> served twice in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and was <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' minister of planning and economic policy in 1968 when <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was thrown out of office for the third time after only serving 11 days as president <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> went into hiding, was jailed for a time and eventually fled to exile. When <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> reorganized his party as the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after a long ban on political activity in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> helped. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who studied at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lacked <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' charisma and spent most of his time behind the scenes of the opposition's seemingly endless attempts to replace the de facto military power that has ruled <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for 21 years. In a pre-election interview he put faith in the hope that the democratic process in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would prevail, electoral fraud or not. He said if he won <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be given a chance to leave gracefully and be fired if he refused. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has hired and fired presidents pretty much at will since he took over the military in 1983. His last victim was <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the general was indicted on drug charges last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Even so, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he trusted the democratic process. `` Remember <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was in very different circumstances,'' he said. `` He was a puppet of the military by the fraud of 1984. That's the price you pay for not being a democratically elected person. You are subject to the decisions of the military.'' He and his wife, <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON>, have one daughter, also named <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> warned today that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> might have to consider developing a new nuclear missile if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> upgrades its short-range rockets. After a meeting with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, which <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> described as reflective of a `` new stage in our relations,'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat berated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resistance to talks on short-range nuclear weapons. `` What is to be feared by talking?'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` No one can be forced in negotiations to do what he does not want to do.'' He described <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to replace its current arsenal of <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> missiles with new rockets of longer range as `` development of a new weapons system,'' and said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would not want to have to take a similar step. `` This would have to be considered, but it would not be by our own choice,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. He likened the new missiles <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to develop to the Soviet SS-23s that are being removed and dismantled under the superpowers' December 1987 treaty on the elimination of medium-range missiles <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to replace the Lance rockets, which have a range of less than 75 miles, with missiles capable of reaching as far as 300 miles, or the upper limit of the short-range category. The Soviets contend the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan, known as modernization, violates the spirit of the INF agreement and would spoil the atmosphere at other arms control talks. That view is shared to a large degree by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has called for U.S.-Soviet negotiations to remove the short-range rockets. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s arsenal is deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> is the driving force behind <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s recent insistence that the negotiations be opened soon, in conflict with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s position that such talks aimed at elimination of short-range forces be made contingent on a balance of East-West conventional arms. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again rejected the Soviet call for short-range negotiations after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The question of how to proceed on the short-range missiles has resulted in a situation where the Soviet and West German positions are closer than those among the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, joining other alliance leaders, said after his talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Friday that scrapping the weapons was out of the question as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> had superior numbers of conventional forces and tactical nuclear weapons. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> held firm on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s position that negotiations should be held promptly to reduce the short-range forces. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also discussed plans for the June 12-15 visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, although those details were not immediately disclosed. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s insistence on short-range arms negotiations has split the alliance before a crucial <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit scheduled at the end of May. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> one day after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced a new arms reduction initiative during a meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reiterated his call for negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons, and also announced a proposal to withdraw 500 <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> battlefield nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> unilaterally. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejected the call for talks on short-range nuclear arsenals, and said the other part of the initiative was a public relations move.

 The warriors with painted faces who flew south to reinforce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said they were n't looking for trouble but were ready if it came. One soldier in the 7th Infantry Division from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ord </ORGANIZATION>, getting aboard cargo jets Friday at this base in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, had been angered by what he knew of recent events in the troubled Latin American nation. `` I watched the beating of that man -LRB- a Panamanian opposition candidate -RRB- on television,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Reith </PERSON>, a 24-year-old private in the light infantry division's field artillery unit. `` It just did n't seem right to me. I'd like to get my hand in there and see if I could n't do something about it.'' <PERSON> Reith </PERSON>'s personal message to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be: `` Look out, because there's some light fighters coming to town. He better keep his eyes open.'' President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered nearly 1,000 Fort Ord troops, and about 1,000 from other bases, mobilized to help protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The 7th Infantry Division is designed to travel light so that it can be deployed swiftly anywhere in the world. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the first of more than 700 soldiers being sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from the 5th Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> left today. Some went by plane and the others headed by truck convoy to <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where they were to board a cargo ship along with their vehicles. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> contingent includes 20 women in non-combat jobs such as mechanics or electronics repair. The Fort Ord troops, in combat gear and their faces splotched with green camouflage paint, departed aboard C-5 and C-141 cargo jets that screamed skyward throughout the day. Many of the division's soldiers refused to comment, saying they had been instructed not to talk with the media. Among the handful who talked with reporters, most said they were prepared to go, that this would be a good test of their training, and that they were just doing their job. `` I'm not scared. I'm just curious what's going to happen. We knew this was coming, we just did n't know when,'' said a 21-year-old soldier from southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> who declined to give his name. Pfc. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabowski </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, assigned to the field artillery unit's operations center, leaned against a jeep as he awaited his turn to load aboard a cargo jet. <PERSON> Grabowski </PERSON>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> just a year, said this is his first deployment outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has n't declared war. We're going down to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. There's not a whole lot to worry about,'' he said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimes </PERSON>, a 19-year-old artillery gunner from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said the deployment to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> interrupted important personal plans. `` This means I wo n't be able to make my girlfriend's graduation from high school,'' <PERSON> Kimes </PERSON> said. `` My leave was canceled by the alert. I could n't even call to let her know.'' Cpl. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> echoed other soldiers' comments that they knew little of the Panamanian situation. `` All I can do is what I'm told to do. The president says I've got to go There's got to be a good reason,'' he said. Little, 23, who is attached to the air defense artillery section that operates the highly potent Stinger missile, acknowledged pride in the weapon, adding: `` I hope we wo n't have to use it.'' One soldier who refused to be interviewed was nevertheless in good spirits. Mugging for television cameras, he smiled, waved and said, `` Hi Mom!,'' then turned to his companions beaming and added, `` I've always wanted to do that.''

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is no fanfare, just a biographical introduction. He is a retired Marine lieutenant colonel. Wounded twice in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Won Silver Star and Bronze Star. Married. Four children. Planned the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> rescue. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Involved in apprehending the <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> hijackers. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Helped plan the raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Ladies and Gentlemen, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. As one, the audience rises. A woman waves an American flag. A man with a flag in his lapel lifts his son so he can see better. A few women wipe their eyes. North steps on the stage. It has been just seven days since a jury convicted him of three felonies and he is about to make his third $ 25,000 speech in two days. `` I never considered myself to be a hero,'' he says. `` I stand before you this evening as a frail and flawed human being like the rest of you.'' The words this evening, before a near-capacity audience of 3,000 in the Front Row Theater in this <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb, sound spontaneous. They are n't. He said them at a morning appearance at the same theater and in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the day before. This is <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on the lecture circuit, making profitable use of his time while he awaits sentencing June 23. To enter the hall, he had to pass demonstrators who chant `` Ollie, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Partners in Crime'' and `` Jail <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>, Jail to the Chief,'' as well as those who praise him as an American hero, a la <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. North speaks to mostly friendly audiences. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, at a feed industry association meeting, his talk on `` Commitment, Trust and Family'' was part of a convention package. This evening's audience paid $ 18.75 a ticket, this morning's $ 17.75 He speaks about the dangers to the young posed by drugs, about meddling by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, about his faith in God and his absolute belief that everything will turn out all right for him back `` at that sad swamp along the Potomac.'' The harshest words are reserved for the news media, especially CBS and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>. `` We have been told by the media, those great thinkers, that <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s a good guy,'' he says at one point. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are fairer and wiser than perhaps <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> would have us believe,'' he says at another. North is polished and impassioned, not much different from the way he testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> two years ago and at his trial, which ended May 4 with guilty verdicts on three charges and acquittals on nine. He has notes, but only glances at them and rambles from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to his belief in Family and God. The speech is sprinkled with wit, some spontaneous, some manufactured. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, when the introducer turned to the wrong side of the stage to welcome him, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s first words were, `` I did n't mean to sneak up behind you, but I have a reputation to uphold.'' His podium here was in a theater-in-the-round and the stage made one complete circuit every 13 minutes. `` I noticed I'm going to the left,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` It maybe the only time in my life I'm turning left.'' He said he would prefer being introduced simply as the husband of one and the father of four. `` I got that backward a couple of weeks ago,'' he said, and the audiences in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> laughed and so did the Ohioans. `` But,'' he said, `` I was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and nobody noticed.'' When a young questioner said the only news out of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved in concerned the presidential puppies, <PERSON> North </PERSON> replied: `` I did n't have anything to do with the puppies. Nor did I have anything to do with <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> being pregnant.'' <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, a vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was booked last year for $ 25,000. He called North `` the hottest property on the public-speaking circuit today.'' Indeed, he said, after word got out about the North engagement some people paid the $ 500 non-member convention fee just to hear <PERSON> North </PERSON>. North himself says, `` I am reluctantly a man of great visibility.'' And, `` I do not stand before you today and ask you to endorse what I did or failed to do.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> says he has has been investigated more than any Mafia figure and refers to himself as `` one who has been blamed for everything from the greenhouse effect to the horrible rain showers we had last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' He makes no bones about his conservative views: _ `` The government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare, not to provide welfare to the general public.'' _ `` We have now an imperial <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trying to usurp the presidency.'' _ `` I remain deeply skeptical about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Today in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> you can criticize former dictators but you ca n't criticize the present one I am an unrepentant anti-communist. I hope I'm not one of the last.'' _ `` We have a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> totally opposed to giving the Nicaraguan freedom fighters anything but Band-Aids and doughnuts ... If we are going to have a constitutional amendment that limits the term of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we ought to have an amendment that limits the terms of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' That last line gets applause every time. North builds up to it by deploring `` electoral gridlock'' because 98 percent of congressmen seeking another term win it. `` More people are returned on a regular basis than are returned to the Politburo in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he says. He sees drugs and voter apathy as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest dangers. And he urges greater support for police officers who are `` outgunned, outpaid and outraced.'' North's evening appearance here lasted more than two hours, more than half of the time spent answering questions. What constitutes leadership? `` The political leaders of this nation ought to be people who do n't simply wet their fingers in their mouth and test the wind.'' It is obvious that many in the audience think that North should be one of those leaders. `` Mr. <PERSON> North </PERSON>, I salute you,'' said one man. `` You had a set of something we all know about. You had the guts to stand up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Your answers were better than the questions those stupid congressmen asked. Please give us a chance to put an X behind your name.'' North fields that one. `` If I was so damn smart I would n't be in so much trouble.'' Later he returns to the theme. `` Someone who incurred the wrath of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> must have done something right.'' He tells the audience his family has endured because of its belief in God. `` I honestly believe the good Lord has a plan for all of us ... it's all going to end well.'' North speaks of the enormous legal expenses that have piled up _ his bills during the trial have been estimated at $ 380,000 a month _ but he does not say whether his speaking fees go to lower that debt. A woman asked where she can contribute money. North replied that the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> established by his former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy classmates `` is the only one that has my endorsement and not a penny goes to me personally.'' He answers questions until the master of ceremonies calls a halt. North says goodbye with the Marine motto: `` Semper Fidelis'' _ Always Faithful. Again there is a standing ovation. North's two bodyguards rush down and lead him out of the theater. And <PERSON> North </PERSON> heads for his chartered jet and back to the `` sad swamp.''

<HEAD>Quake Deaths Blamed on Building, Criminal Investigation Under Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Politburo commission blamed most of the 25,000 deaths in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake on shoddy construction and turned its findings over to prosecutors to file criminal charges, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` The catastrophic consequences of the earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> are explained above all by the low quality of the building and assembly work, by the inadmissible violation of design norms and the strength of underground tremors,'' the official news agency reported. `` There would have been no such huge number of human casualties if the established standards and regulations at all stages of construction, from design to assembly, were observed,'' it said. The report ended an investigation that began immediately after the Dec. 7, 1988 earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and destroyed <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON> and other cities of northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Politburo commission was headed by Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>. The commission turned its findings and materials over to the Procurator General's office `` to file criminal charges and bring those responsible to account,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Many of the structures that fell in the earthquake were newly constructed multistory apartment buildings, which are common throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They collapsed in heaps of rubble, trapping their inhabitants. About 500,000 people were left homeless. Many older buildings with fewer stories remained standing. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is faced with an acute housing shortage and has turned to construction of identical prefabricated blocks throughout the country. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> immediately after the earthquake. As early as mid-December, he said that poor housing construction was a likely cause of the high number of deaths. The commission report confirmed that suspicion. It said the poor construction was aggravated by a lowering of seismic standards in the quake-prone region in 1978. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave no indication how widespread the criminal investigation would be, nor how many people would be prosecuted. Officials have said it will cost billions of dollars to rebuild the Armenian cities, but they have pledged to do it within two years and under strict standards designed to prevent a repeat of the disaster. The commission reported that $ 400 million of construction work was done in the quake area through April. But it reported complacency and lack of coordination in supply and construction. Workers are only able to unload 1,600 of the 2,000 rail cars that arrive daily in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with building supplies, it said.

<HEAD>Is Wright Losing Fight For Public Support? ^An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wages a painstaking legal battle against ethics accusations, there is a growing feeling among his colleagues that the larger war for public opinion is slipping away. While <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s eight-lawyer defense team filed a series of motions contesting the formal case against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last week, the speaker was battered by a series of reports and events _ including the resignation of a top aide over the aide's criminal past _ that kept him publicly on the defensive. The motions `` have the look of a formal, high-risk, all-cards-on-the-table strategy,'' said one <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> supporter, Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. But he noted a `` significant'' change in perceptions of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s standing among colleagues: `` There's a new gloomy, dark feeling among the speaker's supporters.'' One participant in a recent strategy meeting in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office likened the atmosphere to what it must have been like inside the <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during Watergate, according to two sources who were there. Many _ and not just the speaker's supporters _ are bitter about what they see as the unfairness of a process that holds <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to a new and tougher behavior standard than the one that prevailed when many of the alleged rules violations occurred. But few deny the reality of the political damage already done. `` The daily revelations are not helpful,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan. `` There's a two-front war being waged here One is the technical legal war, and the other is the public relations war. It would be a good idea to win both. It's absolutely essential that you have a clear victory in one or the other.'' Two other Midwestern Democrats from different states, who a few weeks ago believed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> might be able to survive as speaker, now have changed their minds. `` He should step down. This hurts everybody,'' said one, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` He can survive the ethics question, but I do n't think he can survive the political question.'' Those who have come to such a conclusion are not willing to be quoted by name, fearing reprisals or being seen as disloyal. One reason for the changing mood is that lawmakers have grown weary of the public's perception of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as preoccupied with its own internal problems. Serious public policy problems, such as the federal budget deficit, are not getting the attention they deserve, they contend. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s potential problems have grown faster than his legal team, which he bolstered last week with the addition of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> trial lawyer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, senior adviser <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and several associates. On Thursday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, one of the speaker's most able and trusted senior aides, resigned amid new reports about his conviction 16 years ago for a brutal attack on a woman. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said in a statement he did not want to become an additional burden to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, but the resignation raised the profile of an matter with greater emotional content than many of the ethics charges surrounding the speaker. `` It tended to personalize the speaker's problems,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan. Since the ethics committee formally charged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on April 17 with 69 instances of violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, new problems have surfaced each week: _ Former employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, firm that markets motivational programs, have questioned whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> did any work to earn the $ 36,000 salary she was paid from 1984 until the ethics probe opened last June. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office issued a statement last week from company chairman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tice </PERSON> asserting that `` Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s performance of her assigned duties was excellent. _ The committee continues to look into a lucrative <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas drilling venture that yielded a quick $ 170,000 profit for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last year, and plans this week to question <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, the administrator of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust. _ News stories have raised questions about whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received preferential treatment in his unsuccessful $ 100,000 investment in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> nursing home venture, receiving dividends and interest payments unavailable to other investors. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also is reported to have taken unreimbursed plane rides on the company's aircraft, but the speaker said he can recall no such rides _ The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has expressed renewed interest in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s dealings, and said this week it will review the evidence for possible criminal violations once the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics case runs its course. One member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s team, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, defended the speaker's emphasis on his legal defense. `` That has always been the speaker's strongest position. The principle struggle now is to prevail legally. The politics will follow.'' The lawyers soon will make oral arguments on their crucial motion to dismiss the most serious charges, probably the week of May 22. In making his assessment, <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> conceded a point that only underlines <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s troubles: that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules are out of date with current public expectations. `` Time has passed, circumstances have changed and ethical standards have appropriately risen,'' he said. Implicit in that statement is that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s dealings _ selling his books in bulk to interest groups and accepting financial benefits from a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> friend _ while meeting the letter of the rules, are out of step with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s new, tougher ethical climate. `` There's such a tremendous shifting sand of ethical standards right now that nobody's really clear on what is ethical and what is not,'' <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer specializing in ethics, said in a recent speech to lobbyists. `` Ethical mores in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> change almost daily. You have to keep ahead of the curve.''

<TEXT>
 Moslem insurgents today claimed about 30,000 guerrillas are massing for an attack on communist-held <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, in the near future. It lent credence to earlier predictions by guerrilla leaders and foreign observers that an assault might occur in mid-May, following the spring thaw and the end last weekend of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Moslem holy month. `` About 30,000 -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- forces will launch a common attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> city very soon,'' the insurgents' <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a guerrilla commander, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, as saying. Neither the agency nor other guerrilla sources would specify the date of the assault. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has insisted that his forces are strong enough to withstand a guerrilla onslaught. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a city of about 2 million inhabitants 110 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, is protected by at least three security rings built by Soviet forces, who for nine years intervened on the government side. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues to arm the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government although the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Protesters March to Denounce Death of Radical Student</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot police wielding truncheons and shields beat back thousands of protesters who gathered on Saturday to protest the death of a radical student. About 4,000 police clashed with protesters who tried to march to the provincial government headquarters. `` Down with murder and torture,'' protesters chanted. Some troops were beaten to the ground by protesters armed with bamboo sticks. The crowd burned helmets and shields seized from police. Police did not stop the estimated 10,000 people from holding a rally in a square in front of the government building, even though fighting broke out several times. Dissident leaders called for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government as the protesters cheered and clapped, shouting `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo'' and `` End the military dictatorship.'' Dissident groups organized the march to denounce the death of the radical student, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-kyu </PERSON>, whose body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, about 170 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Dissidents claimed at a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> earlier Saturday that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was tortured to death by police interrogators. Police denied any involvement in the death. The government is conducting an investigation. `` This barbarous act was committed by the suppressive security forces to suppress the national democratic movement,'' a dissident leader told the estimated 15,000 people at the university rally. Speakers called for nationwide protests to topple <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and expel the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. They claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are scheming to impose military rule on the country. `` <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is the puppet of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists,'' a student leader said. `` Let's fight until we drive out <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>.'' Thousands of people then marched out of the campus and were blocked by riot police. Scuffles broke out as the protesters tried to force their way through human barricades. Several elderly protesters beat troopers with walking sticks and pounded their fists against police armored vans blocking the roads. `` Kill <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' an old man screamed. Many marchers then broke away into side streets, reached the city center and assembled outside the provincial government headquarters for a second rally. Police reported many minor injuries but said there were no arrests. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of anti-government protests and strikes in recent months. Dissident groups are calling for the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general elected in late 1987. Dissidents pledged to end violent protests after six riot police were killed May 3 in a clash with radical students. But the dissidents have not renounced their campaign to topple <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. Authorities fear <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death could provoke unrest in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, since it occurred near Thursday's anniversary of the May 18, 1980, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising in which at least 192 people were killed. Many residents claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is one of those responsible for the bloody suppression of the uprising. The dissidents have little public support because of their violent tactics and extremism. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> ordered a major crackdown on dissidents after the death of the six riot police.

 Authorites on Saturday arrested a policeman who they said went berserk after a colleague kidded him about losing a girlfriend, killing three co-workers and injuring five during a gun-and-grenade spree. Cpl. Hung Yen-chin, 21, put up no resistance when he was arrested shortly before dawn in the <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Hsintien </LOCATION>, near the police training center where the ramapage occurred, police said. Hung was working as a guard at the training center when Sgt. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Teh-yi </PERSON> arrived to relieve him, then teased Hung about losing his girlfriend, police said. Hung shot and killed <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>, then lobbed two hand grenades into a barracks nearby and went on a shooting spree, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Two other police officers were killed and five were hurt. Hung fled with his M-16 rifle, three hand grenades and 200 rounds of ammunition. Police said 1,000 riot troops joined the chase before Hung was finally arrested. Officials said Hung would be court-martialed and could be sentenced to death if convicted.

 Seventeen women, all black and most of them crack addicts and prostitutes, have died mysteriously in the same area since 1986. There have been no signs of violence, no signs of illness _ nothing to suggest who or what may have killed them. Was it a serial killer who knows how to hide signs of violence? A deadly new form of drug abuse? Investigators do n't know. Last week, after a new wave of publicity, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Examiner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> officially declared the cases homicides. But <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> acknowledges that the cause of death remains unknown, and investigators say they are as frustrated as before. `` If, in fact, there is a killer or killers out there, or if it's caused by crack cocaine, we just do n't know yet,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, chief of the headquarters division of detectives for <LOCATION> Metro-Dade </LOCATION> police. `` We consider them open cases and we're investigating them as if they were homicides. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> behavioral scientists and experts from the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have been called in by local authorities to study the sparse data. Their reports are not complete. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> notes that there is not even a proven link among the deaths, which began in September 1986. However, there is a pattern. The bodies of all but one of the women were found in a narrow, predominantly black section of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and an adjoining, unincorporated area of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. They were lying in overgrown vacant lots, abandoned houses or back alleys. The victims' skirts were up or pants down, indicating recent sexual activity. All but two had traces of cocaine in their blood. Most were known as willing to trade sex for crack money. None, however, showed any signs of trauma or violence, and the cause of death is listed as unknown. The latest known victim, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooden </PERSON>, 27, was discovered April 2. `` The geographic distribution of these cases lends support to a presumption of probable homicide based on ... the absence of other proven alternatives at this time,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. There are several theories on what is killing the women, but there are problems with each. If a serial killer is at work, he has gone to great lengths to hide his method of killing the women. The working assumption is that the killer would somehow strangle or smother them _ a difficult cause of death to establish. And police say it strains credulity that the women would quietly suffocate without screaming, fighting or resisting enough to show signs of trauma. The serial killer theory has a different problem. There are no reports from other street people of suspects, and no close escapes matching the circumstances of the deaths. Dr. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, chief toxicologist for the medical examiner's office, says the bodies were even checked for cyanide, but no traces were found People who are poisoned generally show signs of illness before their deaths, and none of the women did. That leaves the possibility of a previously unknown kind of chemical reaction in which small amounts of cocaine _ perhaps coupled with genetic factors, a rundown physical condition or sexual stimulation _ resulted in sudden death. But that theory too has holes, <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> notes. Why is n't the same phenomenon occurring outside this narrow area, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or even neighboring <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>? And why is it affecting only black women? There are plenty of white crack addicts as well. Two of the women had no cocaine at all in their bloodstreams, <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> notes, although it is always possible that their cases are unrelated to the rest. One possible explanation for the narrow geographical distribution of the deaths could be a single dealer distributing crack that is cut with a deadly chemical. But officers sent out into the area to buy samples have found nothing unusual. <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> says tests did n't disclose any such toxic agent. `` We just do n't know what's killing them,'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> says. `` And the people in the street are just as confused as we are. Some think it's a killer, and some think it's the crack. But we'll keep on investigating, and we'll find an answer.''

 When Soviet and Chinese leaders last met in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> hurried out of town with a dour look on his face, and summitry between the communist giants was put on hold for three decades. A new <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief is coming to town Monday, and better results are expected. Chinese analysts believe President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will find common ground with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the 84-year-old leader who has transformed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with market-oriented policies that resurrected the crippled economy. `` The two are reformers,'' said <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugang </PERSON>, an expert on Soviet matters at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` They ought to have a common language.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also will meet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who is closely identified with the economic refoms, and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who studied engineering in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A Western diplomat said privately that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> might go particularly well because both `` are men of vision'' under pressure for pursuing risky reforms. Amicable meetings would go far to erase unpleasant memories of the frosty summit of September 1959 between <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, whose relationship was marked by vast ideological differences and mutual distrust. By the end of that September meeting, the Chinese-Soviet rift was out in the open. `` <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was n't wearing a smile'' as he left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, recalled <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruizhen </PERSON>, a Russian-language interpreter for <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. Personal friction aggravated the difficulties between the two leaders. `` <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> never got along,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who spent several years in the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was introverted and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was very flashy. That contributed to the problem.'' Other Chinese scholars said <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, who avidly studied history and wrote lengthy political essays and esoteric poetry, regarded <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> as uncultured. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has shown an ability to impress and was able to establish good working rapport with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be more adept at handling our leaders'' than <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, said the ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` He has many advisers who were present during the last summit. They know the problems and they understand <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s need for certain things. `` Our leaders want a certain measure of respect. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is an old revolutionary, and we believe <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will treat him as such.'' Xing, the Sovietologist, said good personal chemistry is important because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> `` play the most important policy-making roles in the two countries.''

<HEAD>Teen Mothers Not Getting Support from Schools, Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teen-age girls who are pregnant or have children are not getting the support they need to complete their educations and are likely to experience discrimination at their schools, a new survey indicates. `` Few schools have clear policies about how to treat pregnant and parenting students,'' authors <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> write in a report called `` The Need for a Warming Trend.'' `` Most schools fail the Title IX test,'' the authors add, referring to the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal aid. The findings are based on a survey completed by administrators, teachers or counselors at a dozen diverse schools in eight states. They reflect the results of two earlier studies and, according to experts in the field, the general school climate for students who have or expect children. Pregnancy is far and away the leading cause of female dropouts. At least 40,000 girls quit school each year because they are pregnant, according to the Center for Population Options. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based nonprofit research group, said these girls are often overlooked in discussions of at-risk students and dropout prevention programs. `` Making the school environment more hospitable for these female students _ and for teen-age fathers _ can make a significant dent in dropout statistics, as well as provide these young parents with the education they and their families need,'' the authors wrote. The survey responses revealed Title IX violations at nine of the 12 schools, with several having multiple violations. Among the violations were not allowing absences from school for prenatal or postnatal care or problems associated with pregnancy, requiring pregnant students but not students with other medical conditions to have a doctor's certification to stay in school and not permitting enough leave to recover from pregnancy and birth. All schools said pregnant and parenting students could be club members, be on the ballot for `` Class Favorites'' and participate in graduation ceremonies. But at one of the schools, they are not always allowed to run for student government, be club or class officers, or run for prom or homecoming queen or court. Other schools did not allow the students to be eligible for scholarships, financial aid and prizes on the same basis as other students and did not allow them to participate in sports or athletics programs although there was no medical reason to exclude them. The schools did comply with some important requirements, the survey found. `` None of the schools use pregnancy or parenting as a reason to expel or suspend students,'' the authors said. `` Further, none required that these students enroll in a special program or school, or have home instruction, rather than stay in regular classes.'' But the climate remains chilly, the authors said. Most dropout prevention efforts do not focus on pregnancy and parenting; most schools do not keep attendance, dropout or enrollment statistics on pregnant or parenting teens; and many pregnant girls simply disappear before graduation. All but one school in the survey reported that lack of adequate child care makes it very hard for teen mothers to stay in school. One school had an on-site toddler center but none of the schools had on-site infant care _ the hardest kind of care to find and the most critical in terms of getting a mother back into the classroom before she drifts away permanently. The survey also found that two-thirds of the schools have someone available to tell pregnant girls about health services and half of them have someone who can tell the girls about social services such as welfare, food stamps, nutrition programs and child care. But only a minority routinely refer girls to community agencies and some schools did not view coordination as their responsibility. The neglect appears to stem from a feeling that `` they brought this on themselves'' and the fact that girls who become pregnant and parents usually are not the best students, experts say. `` They tend to be marginal students,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>, director of adolescent pregnancy prevention at the Children's Defense Fund `` They are the kids who are not noticed. A lot are left to just quietly slide.'' She and others said the results of the <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> survey, though based on a small sample, are representative of what is happening at schools across the country. `` You can generalize from that sample,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a social work professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adolescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pregnancy </ORGANIZATION> and Parenting. For example, she said, there are only three school-based day care sites in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 611 school districts. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of the Center for Population Options stressed that schools vary widely in what they offer to pregnant and parenting students. But <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said of the survey: `` What they're reporting is generally true and probably true roughly in the proportions that it's being reported.'' Schools in the survey were <ORGANIZATION> Benito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Thibodaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Thibodaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Bladensburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bladensburg </LOCATION>, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Gaithersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lusby </LOCATION>, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caroline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ridgely </LOCATION>, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Minuteman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in White Fish, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Guiderland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guiderland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>.

 Rival fans at an soccer game today spilled onto the field and began fighting, and an ambulance spokesman said 11 people were hospitalized. Officials said none of the injuries was serious. It was the first significant incident of crowd violence in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> since 95 fans died in the <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> stadium crush on April 15. Fans of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> spilled onto the field after <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> took a 1-0 lead. They were confronted by <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> supporters and fought on the field, officials said. The English Soccer League game was stopped immediately. Referee <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodenham </PERSON> ordered the players off the field as seven mounted police came on to restore order. An ambulance spokesman said 11 people were taken to <LOCATION> Mayday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and said there had not been any report of serious injuries. Four ambulances were sent to <LOCATION> Selhurst </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to take away injured fans. A reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at the game said the injuries included broken ribs and a gash on one person's head. A police spokeswoman said some people had been arrested but did not give a specific number. The game was restarted after the incident. Officials said there were about 16,000 fans at the game. The police presence at many English soccer matches has been increased since the stadium crush at a Football Association Cup semifinal at <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. Overcrowding in the stands led to the fatal crush of fans.

<HEAD>Government Moves to Ban Chemical Alar from Apples and Other Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday steps to ban using the growth regulating chemical Alar on apples and other foods but said final action is not likely for at least 18 months. Alar is used by some apple growers and became the center of controversy recently when a private study cited it as being particularly harmful to children, who eat large amounts of apple products. The uproar prompted some school districts to stop serving apples and in some cases has has caused parents to stop using them, despite assurances from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the growers themselves. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> until recently estimated that only about 4 percent of the apples continue to be exposed to Alar, but the agency said Saturday that recent findings have caused them to increase that estimate. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> now estimates that as many as 15 percent of last year's crop may have been sprayed with Alar. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had said in February that it would begin regulatory action aimed at Alar and has urged that the chemical, technically called daminozide, be voluntarily taken off the market because it has been found to cause cancer in test animals. Alar's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has disputed the health claims and continued to sell the chemical, which keeps apples on trees longer and provides longer shelf life. Earlier this week a trade group that represents processors of apple products urged the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to announce a formal regulatory action to ban the product in hopes of dissuading growers from using it. Many food processors claim that checks are made for Alar and apples containing the chemical are not used in products such as apple sauce and juice. Consumers have not been convinced, however, and the recent concerns about the chemical have caused a drop in apple product sales of as much as 20 percent, according to the Processed Apples Institute. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, acting deputy administrator, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed ordering Alar off the market because it `` over a lifetime -LRB- it -RRB- poses unreasonable risks to the public.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> reiterated, as he did in February when announcing the agency's intention to ban the chemical, that the health risk is not great enough to warrant an emergency ban, which could go into effect immediately. `` I want to emphasize that, based on our current estimates, the short-term risks of eating food treated with daminozide are not significant and do not pose an imminent or major public-health threat,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also have pronounced apples safe for consumption even though some may contain Alar. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> began a review of Alar in 1984 and two years later proposed taking it off the market after it was found to have caused cancer in test animals. Those findings were challenged, however, and the agency directed additional studies. The studies have yet to be completed, but <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said preliminary evidence is clear enough to warrant rulemaking procedures that eventually will direct Alar not be used. A final ban is not expected for nearly 18 months and could take twice that long if the action is challenged, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today began a partial withdrawal of soldiers and tanks stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It was the first pullout of permanent Soviet forces since a 1968 invasion to crush Communist-led reform. A 6 -LCB- - mile column of Soviet army vehicles headed home from the north Moravian city of <LOCATION> Olomouc </LOCATION>, according to state-run media A brief ceremony sponsored by local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials marked the departure. The reports did not say how many soldiers and tanks were in the procession. The partial withdrawal of Soviet soldiers was announced in December by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as part of an overall plan to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by half a million men by 1991. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promised withdrawal of 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by 1991 began last month with the much publicized departure of 31 T-64 tanks from a base in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Soviet troops and tanks have also begun to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Until <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> launched the short-lived `` Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had no troops or tanks permanently stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Soviet and other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troops and tanks first entered the country for lengthy maneuvers in mid-1968 in a sign of increasing nervousness among <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> allies over <ORGANIZATION> Dubcek </ORGANIZATION>'s reforms The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces withdrew to just over the Czechoslovak border in July 1968, but returned Aug. 20. The invasion crushed reforms and led to the expulsion of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and nearly 500,000 others from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. According to Western estimates, the Soviets have about 80,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Czechoslovak chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON>, said in February the Soviets will withdraw 5,300 soldiers, 708 tanks and 20 planes by the end of 1990. Four battalions numbering some 1,500 men will be withdrawn this year.

 Authorities searching through tons of debris found a 24-year-old man alive more than 14 hours after a runaway freight train jumped its tracks at 90 mph and slammed into a row of houses, killing four. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was half-asleep in his home Friday when the out-of-control train catapulted off a curve. Locomotives and freight cars loaded with unprocessed potash were sent crashing into 11 houses, including his. He was found shortly before 9 p.m. and spoke to rescuers who fed him oxygen through a tube and encouraged him throughout the 1 -LCB- - hour rescue operation `` I would never have believed that this individual could have survived where he was,'' said a rescue coordinator, whose name was not immediately available. `` He had major train parts against his body.'' The body of the fourth victim of the crash, the brakeman, was found early today. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> apparently was able to survive after metal debris formed a cave, creating an air pocket with enough oxygen to sustain him, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a rescue supervisor. `` I'm glad my son is out of the house,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Maryann </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` I was so confused.

He suffered a broken right leg, said <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flint </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hospital. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was in serious condition early today. `` Christopher is awake and alert and in good spirits,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Flint </PERSON> added. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight apparently lost its brakes near the top of the 4,190-foot Cajon Pass and careened down the flank of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveland </PERSON>. During their desperate plunge, the five-man crew radioed that they were out of control. Then the train, two-thirds of a mile long, plowed into a modest neighborhood of single-story homes about 7:40 a.m in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Killed were conductor <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crown </PERSON>, 36; brakeman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, 44; and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 7, stepbrothers whose home was flattened by cars of the 3,470-foot-long train. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fricks </PERSON> said her grandson, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, 9, who lives with her, watched as the body of a little boy, a school chum of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s, was carried away. `` He saw them taking the body out under a blanket and he started crying,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fricks </PERSON> said. Dogs used to search for victims of the 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake were flown in from northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to help find <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, whose body was discovered about 2:30 a.m. today. Scores of rescuers worked to free <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. His house was shattered and he was buried under debris and tons of the sandlike potash. Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said her son had been drowsy and was lying in bed in a front bedroom. `` I knocked on the door and told him to remember to shut everything off because he has a habit of leaving the iron on,'' she said. After the crash, she stared at a 25-foot tower of wreckage covering the house. Only the mailbox was still standing. Hospitals in the area reported treating at least eight people for varying injuries, including engineer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, 34, who was in serious and stable condition late Friday suffering from fractured ribs, bruises and cuts, said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardine </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The other crew members who suffered minor injuries were engineer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 42, and brakeman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterbury </PERSON>, 57. One of the train's five crew members radioed to a dispatcher in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that the train was out of control, <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> said. The Mayday call was received by the dispatcher shortly before 7:30 a.m. The 69-car freight had four engines in front and two `` helper engines'' in back. The rear engines had applied full brakes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will coordinate investigation of the crash. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said six houses were destroyed, one had major damage and four had minor damage. Property damage was estimated at $ 600,000. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said a shelter had been set up at the <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and 237 people had been fed and housed at area hotels Friday night. `` The train was all over the place. It looked like a toy in a sandbox,'' said eyewitness <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorame </PERSON>. `` It was just everywhere _ in people's yards. Pieces of the axles were in people's yards. Sand covered a whole house. Some of the people thought it was an earthquake.'' Crews pumped 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel from overturned engines to prevent an explosion.

<HEAD>Leningrad Reformers Try To Oust Politburo Member</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reformers in the nation's second-largest city have begun a grass-roots campaign to oust <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, a move that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The reformers defeated 12 local party leaders during March elections for the new Soviet legislature and now are seeking to remove those leaders from their regular <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> posts, the reformers say. The prime target is <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief and a member of the Politburo. <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippov </PERSON>, a leader of the recall movement, said his group is working through small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> groups to demand <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>'s replacement. `` What's important is that change is coming from below,'' said <PERSON> Filippov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON> is the highest ranking of the approximately three dozen party officials nationwide who lost in the March 26 elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>'s deputies. The defeats in the nation's first multi-candidate elections were an embarrassing blow to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Filippov </PERSON> said he believed there is support now among <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party members to hold a special conference on the removal of <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> as party chief and the ouster of other old-line leaders. One-third of the party members must agree before such a conference can be held. <PERSON> Filippov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>'s ouster as <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief likely would persuade the Politburo to remove him from that elite body. Membership on the Politburo is determined by the 20 members and by the larger <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of top-level Communists. <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>'s loss in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies was particularly humiliating because he failed to to win 50 percent of the vote, even though he had no opponent. After his defeat, <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> complained bitterly at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenary meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the party had lost its unity. That earned him sharp criticism from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who supports greater openness in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> affairs. Elections for the seat <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> sought and for 197 other unfilled seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies seats are to be held Sunday. The seats still open are those in which no candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote during the March balloting. Many of the reformers are running for <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s four remaining seats in the new legislature. Already, several <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organizations in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> have passed resolutions demanding the special conference to replace the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> leadership, said <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Salye </PERSON>, a party member and candidate in Sunday's election. She said reformers will intensify the fight for a special party conference as soon as the current election is completed. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said it's an internal affair in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Filippov </PERSON> said. He said he considers that a green light for the sort of grass-roots political action mentioned by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But speculation persists that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> plans to pre-empt the local uprising by appointing an outsider to <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>'s post, said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who declined to be named. Most of the representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies were elected from districts based on geography. Another 750 seats were reserved for representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions and social and professional groups. The new congress is to open on May 25.

 The zonies and zdonks are sure bets, but the aoudads were nothing but trouble, says a man who wants to make a business out of exotic livestock. `` Believe me, away from here it's a good business. I just hope to make it a good business here,'' said farmer <PERSON> Glawson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> makes his living selling ordinary horses, cattle and donkeys on his north <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> farm. But he expects to expand his line within the next year. The 57-year-old entrepreneur, who already had buffaloes, llamas, buzzards, peacocks and pheasants on his farm, bought two zebra stallions at an exotic animal auction and plans to breed them to his donkeys and Shetland ponies. The resulting animals will be zdonks and zonies, <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> said. `` Do n't just everybody want a zebra,'' <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> said recently. `` They're mean as Satan and if you take out after them there is n't a fence that can hold them But you mix them with a donkey or Shetland pony and what you get is as sweet as can be.'' The half-Shetland pony hybrid will sell for $ 1,500, the donkey-zebra cross will go for up to $ 3,500, <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> said. Although you wo n't find these animals in the dictionary, the crossbreeding of zebras to donkeys and horses has been done for years, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, curator at the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Zoos consider the resulting animals nothing but curiosities, he said. <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> already has had success with his bobbydoes. The half sheep, half goat can sell for up to $ 600. He had less luck when he was given some aoudads, a type of African sheep with long, curved horns. `` They're kind of goat-looking things and can jump 16-foot fences,'' he said. `` We could n't keep ours penned up. As far as I know they're still running wild out in the woods. `` I keep waiting to hear about some hunter shooting a creature that nobody can identify, but I guess they ca n't catch up with them either.''

 Seven white men tarred and feathered a white mayor on Saturday as he officiated at a multiracial wheelchair race, police said. The attackers were arrested for endangering public order, said police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Crewe </PERSON>. He said it was not known whether they were affiliated with any paticular right-wing organization. He said <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouws </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Welkom </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> province, was attacked just after he had set off contestants in the wheelchair race. The men poured a sticky fluid and feathers over <PERSON> Gouws </PERSON>, said Crew. Crew said the men also roughed up <PERSON> Gouws </PERSON>' aide and a traffic policeman who tried to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> mayor. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained control of scores of rural towns in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> in October municipal elections and has tried to reintroduce some racial restrictions that had been abolished over the past few years.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he welcomes Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer to cut 500 short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Let him do what he says unilaterally. It would be good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters while flying here aboard Air Force One. He added that `` we've already removed 2,000 nuclear weapons, and it would be nice to have him -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- go ahead and make some moves.'' The president was asked whether he was going to win the `` public relations war'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` No such war. I want to win the peace war _ lasting peace _ that built on action, not on words.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came a day after he urged a new approach to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, saying he wants to welcome that country `` back to the world order.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Alcorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s commencement here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the black institution's graduating class that `` any definition of a successful life must include serving others.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs your talent. And that's not idle talk,'' he said. Returning to a favorite domestic theme, community service, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped some graduates would enter politics `` to fight for what you believe in, to grapple not only with your own dreams, but also those of your countrymen.'' He urged others to enter business, `` where you can create jobs, adding to the opportunity of other Americans,'' and the teaching profession, where `` your touchstones should be excellence, accountability, and choice.'' `` Whatever you choose, it is within you to change the world _ and any definition of a successful life must include serving others,'' the president said in the text that was released by his staff in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he spent the night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quoted the slain civil rights leader, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, saying that `` intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character _ that is the goal of true education.'' He also noted his own 41-year history of support for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and said he hoped to help college students get into government work through his new recruitment program for part-time and summer positions. Later today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> commencement, the last in a trio of graduation addresses over two days. On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to make a major foreign policy speech in which he called for a new era of relations with the the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to meet goals that will establish a `` friendship that knows no season of suspicion, no chill of distrust.'' Signaling a willingness to shift from previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approaches, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced that he wants to move beyond the traditional `` containment'' policy toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, `` to welcome the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> back to the world order.'' `` Our goal is bold _ more ambitious than any of my predecessors could have thought possible,'' the president said. But he warned that the Soviets would have to meet certain expectations _ making good on its promises of openness and democratization _ for the relationship to take off. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comments in a commencement address at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent the night in his adopted hometown of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he went for a jog and dined out with friends. His speech Friday staked out a forward-looking approach, geared to making the most of what national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> called this `` unusual phase of history'' when the Soviets are also taking a new approach. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has as its goal much more than simply containing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> expansionism _ we seek the integration of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the community of nations,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He offered the promise of improved economic and trade relations, if the Soviets `` meet the challenge of responsible international behavior'' by such steps as withdrawing troops around the world, removing the Iron Curtain between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, improving human rights and cooperating in solving regional disputes. `` Ultimately, our objective is to welcome the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> back into the world order,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not looking to make `` catchy headlines'' with his foreign policy. `` None of our proposals are going to be that traumatic,'' Scowcroft said. `` You do n't turn a great nation like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> around quickly. We're talking about modifications of direction.'' Scowcroft had a dim view of an arms reduction proposal <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> following meetings with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement that the Soviets would unilaterally cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was `` designed principally to create problems'' within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer a public relations ploy. In his speech Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed two specific policy changes: an `` open skies'' policy under which each country would be permitted to overfly the other's territory and monitor military activities; and easing of the 17-year-old law, the Jackson-Vanik measure, that ties trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to emigration policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would support a `` temporary waiver'' of the rule and offer the Soviets favored trade status if the Soviets codify new laws ensuring free emigration. `` Ending discriminatory treatment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms would be a helpful step. Trade and financial transactions should take place on a normal commercial basis,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the `` hopeful _ indeed remarkable _ signs'' of Soviet openness should be viewed with an eye toward deeds to back up the rhetoric, and `` enduring, ingrained economic and political change'' within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Make no mistake, a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and cities of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Why not, then, let this spirit of openness grow, let more barriers come down.''

<TEXT>
 A cyclone whirled through the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Nilphamari </LOCATION> district, killing two people and destroying more than 5,000 mud-and-straw houses, officials said Saturday. Friday's storm brought needed rains to <LOCATION> Nilphamari </LOCATION> and two other districts in the northwestern corner of the country. But despite a forecast of more rainfall in the next two days, the officials said there was little hope of reversing the damage caused by three months of drought. Contacted by telephone at <LOCATION> Nilphamari </LOCATION>, the officials said the cyclone reached speeds of 60 mph. It injured 50 people, destroyed 66 tin-roofed schools and uprooted many trees, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The weather office in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> said more than a half-inch of rain fell on <LOCATION> Nilphamari </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dinajpur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rangpur </LOCATION> districts in a two-hour period. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita annual income of $ 160, alternates between too much and too little water. Last summer's floods submerged four-fifths of the country and killed at least 1,400 people. Cyclones in November claimed 1,100 more lives, and another 1,100 perished in tornadoes last month. The current drought threatens to destroy at least 50 percent of the rice and wheat crop now in the ground, according to government officials who had counted on the spring harvest to yield 5.6 millions tons of grain. That's about one-fourth the amount <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> needs to feed its 110 million people each year.

 <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Republicans are holding their collective breath, hoping they will hear good news when Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> reveals later this month whether she will seek a third term in 1990. State Democrats are equally anxious, because of the chance an open seat would give them to elect a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator for the first time in 50 years. If <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> shuns another six-year term, it would have the biggest impact of any single event on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> politics in many years. Not only would it portend a free-for-all for her <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, but it likely would put three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House seats up for grabs, as those incumbents bid to succeed her. Indications are <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> will make her decision known this week. Contacted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, she would n't say whether she had made a decision, but said she would make a public announcement. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> said previously she will decide this month. Since she is scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> the week of May 22-26, her announcement could come within the next four or five days. Republicans have been urging <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> to run again, imploring her both publicly and privately. They see the woman who won re-election in 1984 with 76 percent of the vote as a shoo-in. If she wo n't run, two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, are considered likely contenders for the party's nomination. That would mean a costly and possibly divisive primary. With Democratic Congressman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> certain to try to succeed <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> if she does n't run, Democrats see it as their best chance to elect a senator since former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> narrowly missed ousting Republican Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in 1974. There has n't been a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> since 1939. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, 56, is the daughter of former <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> governor <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, who lost the 1936 presidential election to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. Her 1978 election made her the first female representative from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and the first woman elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without having been preceded by her husband. At present, she's one of only two women in the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> is the other. There are good arguments supporting both sides in the speculation over whether <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> wants to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or call it quits after 12 years. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> is known to have told friends and political associates she was tired of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and longed for a more private life. And she pledged in 1978 she would serve only two terms. She has also said she needs to consider her elderly mother, <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>. On the other hand, she is sensitive to her party's dilemma and the fact many people want her to run again. Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are among those in the dark. `` I have for some time encouraged her to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but I deeply respect the fact it is a decision that only she can make,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. The governor said a key reason for <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> to take a third term is the seniority she would have. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said he thought until three weeks ago that <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> would not run, but has changed his thinking. `` I have no facts to base it on, it's just a feeling,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. `` I feel she is in a position to really have an impact in the next six years, and that's why she should run.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> also has `` an intuitive feeling,'' but it's the just the opposite, that she will not run. `` It's just my feeling. I'm not necessarily hoping it,'' the Democratic chairman said. `` I think she is a very honest and dedicated person who decided to run for two terms and did so, and now wants to do something else with her life.''

Amid all this progress, the Soviets have not torn down the Berlin Wall or renounced the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, which justifies military intervention in East European countries to snuff out rebellion against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. But the Cold War is receding. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, on his first trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week, helped push the dark shadows back more. He and a team drawn from all over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, started working with their Soviet counterparts on a framework for cooperation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and on nine specific global problems. These include terrorism, earthquakes and other natural disasters, climate changes and narcotics traffic. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> agreed to meet three or four times a year, with the next session here in September. Specialists on the two sides will work out their own schedules for meetings. As a result, the U.S.-Soviet dialogue is expanding, the opportunity for cooperation enlarged even beyond the detente era of U.S.-Soviet reconciliation in the 1970s. But these developments are getting slight attention. Despite a strong effort by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to shift the focus away from arms control and to regional problems on which the two sides could work in concert, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rolled out two headline-making initiatives at their meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for cutbacks in nuclear and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Knocked off-balance and cautious by nature, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration responded slowly to the Soviet leader, whose initiatives were having these results: 1. Further strains within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION>, already divided by a dispute over whether th improve short-range nuclear missiles targeted on <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact installations. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other opponents of the missile modernization plan are inclined to be more receptive to disarmament than the hardline <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British governments. All agreed at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting on Friday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s decision to remove 500 nuclear warheads from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was modest in comparison to the withdrawal of 2,400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warheads over the last decade. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves intensified the pressure for negotiated reductions in short-range nuclear weapons on both sides that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> regard as threatening to the defense of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. His proposal to sharply reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces lends support to the argument that it is safe to negotiate nuclear missile reductions because the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s non-nuclear edge will disappear. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called the proposition hypothetical at a news conference in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Friday. `` I'm reminded,'' he said, `` of the old saying back home ` if the dog had n't stopped he would have caught the rabbit.' I mean let's see it happen and then address that question.'' 2. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting May 29-30 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that was supposed to celebrate 40 years of Western unity is now more likely to be marked by division over missiles and how to cope with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, failed in separate meetings this week to persuade West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to back off demands for missile negotiations. 3. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long-awaited first foreign policy declaration, delivered Friday to the graduating class at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, appeared pallid in comparison to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revived a 34-year-old `` open skies'' proposal first made by President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> under which <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries would allow surveillance planes from the other side to fly over their territory. His declaration that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still had to earn the right to membership in `` the world order'' and to warmer relations with Western nations seemed out of step with fast-moving events. `` Let him do what he says unilaterally, it would be good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him Saturday in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Asked whether he was going to win the `` public relations war'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to `` win the peace war.''

 Less than two months ago, a criminal investigator turned an anti-corruption crusade into political magic and won a parliamentary seat with 86 percent of the vote. Today, <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> is in trouble with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for jailing a scientist who died in prison. And the country's highest executive power said Saturday he is interfering with an investigation of alleged abuses of power. But <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON>'s fellow investigator, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, has charged the two are running into trouble because their investigations are making high-ranking officials squirm. The controversy gripping <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> is a lesson both in rapidly changing Soviet electoral politics and in President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s effort to make his country one ruled by law rather than personal dictate. <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON>, a 49-year-old senior investigator with the prosecutor general's office, last year exposed a corruption scandal in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> that brought him national attention. An article on the scandal, written by <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> and published in <LOCATION> Ogonyok </LOCATION> magazine, caused uproar at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in June and turned the two into national heroes. Several months later, a criminal investigation began and led to the conviction of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, the son-in-law of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, on charges of accepting bribes. He was sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp. Gdlyan capitalized on his popularity in March congressional elections _ the country's first multicandidate nationwide ballot in 70 years. Voters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tushinsky </LOCATION> district swept him into office with 86.6 percent of the vote. The balloting was marked by a strong anti-establishment streak. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s reformist campaign garnered 89 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ballots, and disgruntled voters in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> voted against government and party leaders. But in a statement published Saturday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, came down hard on <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON>. The statement in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda accused the prosecutors of making provocative statements in meetings and in the media about alleged violations of law by Soviet leaders. It said the investigtors' statements were designed to `` disorient people and interfere in the work of a specially formed commission ... to verify the numerous ... complaints of citizens about abuses by <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> in carrying out their investigative work.'' On May 7, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it found systematic abuse in <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON>'s handling of an investigation into prominent Estonian scientist, I.A. Hint. The 67-year-old scientist, who won the prestigious Lenin Prize, was convicted in 1983 of bribery, theft, and smuggling. He suffered from a cardiovascular illness and died in jail. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a lawyer by training, has encouraged the Soviet courts to take on controversial issues that in the past they rarely touched. He has demanded the legal system be strengthened to prevent a return to rule by personal dictate, characterized by the leadership of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned Hint's conviction and questioned whether <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> should keep his job based upon charges he refused to hear <PERSON> Hint </PERSON>'s arguments and denied him access to a lawyer. When Hint's wife died shortly after his arrest, the scientist was not told. The court charged <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> showed `` an anti-humanistic character alien to Soviet criminal procedure and a cruel relation to the accused.'' In an April 29 issue of the popular weekly, Arguments and Facts, <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said high-ranking opponents were responsible for attacks on them. `` Efforts to shield participants, compromise investigators, endless ` verifications' ... are links of the same chain, having little to do with the idea of creating a a government based on law,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Republicans are holding their collective breath, hoping they will hear good news when Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> reveals later this month whether she will seek a third term in 1990. State Democrats are equally anxious, because of the chance an open seat would give them to elect a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator for the first time in 50 years. If <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> shuns another six-year term, it would have the biggest impact of any single event on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> politics in many years. Not only would it portend a free-for-all for her <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, but it likely would put three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House seats up for grabs, as those incumbents bid to succeed her. Indications are <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> will make her decision known this week. Contacted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, she would n't say whether she had made a decision, but said she would make a public announcement. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> said previously she will decide this month. Since she is scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> the week of May 22-26, her announcement could come within the next four or five days. Republicans have been urging <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> to run again, imploring her both publicly and privately. They see the woman who won re-election in 1984 with 76 percent of the vote as a shoo-in. If she wo n't run, two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, are considered likely contenders for the party's nomination. That would mean a costly and possibly divisive primary. With Democratic Congressman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> certain to try to succeed <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> if she does n't run, Democrats see it as their best chance to elect a senator since former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> narrowly missed ousting Republican Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in 1974. There has n't been a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> since 1939. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, 56, is the daughter of former <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> governor <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, who lost the 1936 presidential election to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. Her 1978 election made her the first female representative from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, and the first woman elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without having been preceded by her husband. At present, she's one of only two women in the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> is the other. There are good arguments supporting both sides in the speculation over whether <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> wants to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or call it quits after 12 years. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> is known to have told friends and political associates she was tired of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and longed for a more private life. And she pledged in 1978 she would serve only two terms. She has also said she needs to consider her elderly mother, <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>. On the other hand, she is sensitive to her party's dilemma and the fact many people want her to run again. Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are among those in the dark. `` I have for some time encouraged her to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but I deeply respect the fact it is a decision that only she can make,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. The governor said a key reason for <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> to take a third term is the seniority she would have. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said he thought until three weeks ago that <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> would not run, but has changed his thinking. `` I have no facts to base it on, it's just a feeling,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. `` I feel she is in a position to really have an impact in the next six years, and that's why she should run.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> also has `` an intuitive feeling,'' but it's the just the opposite, that she will not run. `` It's just my feeling. I'm not necessarily hoping it,'' the Democratic chairman said. `` I think she is a very honest and dedicated person who decided to run for two terms and did so, and now wants to do something else with her life.''

 Reformist leaders are getting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> together again after 30 years of estrangement, but mistrust between the two huge neighbors is rooted in the centuries. When <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> meet in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this week, they may find old scars are still sensitive. <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was perplexed by his inability to deal with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and blamed the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader for the collapse of relations. Years later, he wrote in his memoirs: `` You might say that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is both close to us and far from us. It's close in that it's our next-door neighbor and shares a long border with our country. At the same time, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is far away in that the Chinese have little in common with our people.'' In the 1950s, with the Nationalists driven from the Chinese mainland and anti-communism at its height in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, fear spread that the world's most populous nation would unite with the strongest Communist power to overwhelm <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They have been viewed as a triangle ever since. The marriage of neighbors survived less than a decade, and in 1972 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began a normalization process that challenged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to catch up. Mistrust goes back at least to the 13th century, when Mongol hordes invaded <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, burning towns and villages, slaughtering the residents and enslaving those they left alive. Soviet children still are taught of the brutality visited on their ancestors and of the historic victory of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, who `` threw off the Mongol yoke'' and established the Russian state in 1480. A more recent seed of suspicion was planted in the infancy of the world Communist movement. In 1927, a decade after the Bolshevik revolution, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> began a bloody purge of Chinese Communists with whom he was ostensibly allied. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> remained silent, apparently unwilling to alienate <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> and expecting him to prevail. During World War II, he aided <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>'s Nationalists against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was the first to recognize the Communist government on the Chinese mainland. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> but spent much of the 10 weeks he was there waiting to see the Soviet dictator. They signed a 30-year Treaty of Friendship. <PERSON> Khruschev </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ignored <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s special sensitivity to foreign exploitation. The Soviets wanted access to Chinese resources but <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> resisted, mindful of the unequal treaties and trade concessions extracted by the English, Portuguese and others. Soviet suspicions arose after <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, in 1954, invited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to send a million laborers to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to help exploit the rich resources. When <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> accepted, the Soviets convinced themselves he was trying to take over the Siberian economy and absorb the vast, sparsely populated territory. `` In short, they wanted to make <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> Chinese rather than Russian,'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> recalled. `` It was a clever maneuver, but it did n't work.'' The Kremlin quickly ended the labor program. Relations had become touchy by that time and were exacerbated by <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s denunciation of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the so-called `` secret speech'' at the 20th Soviet Party Congress in 1956. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> initially joined in criticizing the late dictator, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> wrote, but then reversed course and began praising <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` I think that, secretly, he disapproved all along of our censuring <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for his crimes,'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> said. `` Why do I think so? Because I believe <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> suffered from the same megalomania <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had all his life. He had the same diseased outlook on other people.'' Mistrust became animosity when the Soviets reneged on an agreement to provide <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with nuclear weapons technology. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was eager to use the bomb on his enemies. Despite the decline in relations, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> made a secret trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in hopes of persuading <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> to let the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy build a communications base and refueling facilities on Chinese territory. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> resisted. At the last summit, in September 1959 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, `` the warmth had gone out of our relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and it had been replaced by a chill that I could sense as soon as I arrived,'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> recalled. Soviet advisers and engineers assigned to projects in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> became the butt of anti-Soviet feeling. The Kremlin, incensed and suspecting <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> encouraged the behavior, withdrew all technical personnel in the summer of 1960, leaving hundreds of projects unfinished. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s rejection of what he considered Soviet revisionism brought the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution intended to purify Chinese communism, further widening the gulf. Soviet and Chinese troops fought several border skirmishes in 1969. As recently as 1979, the year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> finally restored normal relations, the threat of war loomed along the frontier. In a book seen as a not-so-subtle threat, Soviet author <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> predicted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ethnic minorities would rise up and seek unity with their cousins in pro-Soviet <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, widely believed to have ties to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police, said fighting could start `` at any moment'' and hundreds of thousands of Soviet `` volunteers'' would rush to aid the oppressed minorities.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has survived <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions, drug indictments and years of opposition demonstrations. The question of the hour has become, can he survive his own mistakes? <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> permitted an election and lost it, and even worse, showed weakness by failing to successfully steal it. He also gave strength and a sense of unity to his enemies by ordering or allowing an attack on opposition candidates before the eyes of the world. With all that, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still has sources of support both in the country and apparently in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, command of which has given him de facto control of the country. The general genuinely thought his forces would win the election, or at least come close enough so that a little fraud would n't be noticed. `` He did n't have a clue that his man might lose,'' said former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, an international observer who talked to the general before last Sunday's election. A win would have given <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime credibility, both internationally and internally. `` It would have let him thumb his nose at the world,'' said one Western analyst. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> served a particularly useful role because he accepted the process as fair until the last moment. The spectacle of a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president known for rectitude declaring that he personally had seen officials counting counterfeit vote tallies destroyed the election's credibility. Clusters of Panamanians watched in fascination whenever the press conference was replayed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces television. Nevertheless, the official count proceeded, showing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> leading 2-1 despite opposition counts and respected exit polls that showed a 3-1 win for opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. By Wednesday, apparently, the divide between fiction and reality became too great to bear and the election was nullified. `` The opposition had a shocking majority,'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintera </PERSON>, an independent lawyer. The opposition demonstrated against the election Monday, but as so often in the past, thousands of demonstrators scattered like frightened quail before a few dozen police. Such scenes raised questions about the opposition's fortitude, but there was no question about what happened Wednesday. The opposition candidates, including the pacific, bespectacled and terrified <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, were beaten bloody before television cameras by pipe-wielding thugs. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> showed his desperation,'' said first vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, one of the victims. The result was a hurricane of international disapproval, isolating the Panamanian government at a moment when it most needed help in a confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent additional American troops to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, but the Panamanian government's efforts to rally opinion against them had little effect and probably wo n't unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> actually intervenes The opposition is discussing calling for a one-day work stoppage Wednesday. They have offered to negotiate with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but only if he agrees to depart. Still, one of the opposition's problems has been its tendency to look north for a solution, a tendency it has not entirely lost. `` The PDF -LRB- soldiers -RRB- would throw down their guns the moment <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters flew over the barracks,'' said one opposition supporter. That's unlikely unless <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens are in danger. The government coalition has shown a tense outward unity, but some of the nine parties got virtually no votes and feel they were fatally damaged by their connection to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has never been one for making public speeches, but his silence during a national crisis has been remarkable and has encouraged speculation he is dealing with trouble in the officer corps. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s support always has been based on the lower side of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s racial and class divide, a divide that some still feel strongly. `` We kicked the oligarchy out in 1968 and we do n't want them back,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporter. The Defense Forces have been recruited largely from the lower class, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has remarked that if the `` rabi-blancos,'' which translates loosely to `` white butts,'' paid more attention, `` there would be a different commander today.'' Nevertheless, the size of the opposition vote suggests support at all levels. Regime opponents claim that at some polls where hundreds of soldiers voted, the government received fewer than 100 votes. `` They could n't even keep the votes they bought,'' said an opposition statement. The only constitutional option is another election before Sept. 1, when acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s term is up. Unconstitutional possibilities that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might favor include a provisional junta and extending <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s term. But on an elemental level, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has lost his biggest advantage. Whatever else he was, he was <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strong man, and the opposition was seen as weak. He will have trouble getting what he wants unless he can restore his position.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Teaches Poised To Strike After Lengthy Impasse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Teachers in the nation's second-largest school district, seeking more money and more control of the curriculum, are threatening a strike Monday that could create chaos for 594,000 students weeks before school's end. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, said its members would keep at home with them the attendance and grade records that School Superintendent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> demanded be handed in by Monday. The records, said <ORGANIZATION> Telfair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Malin </PERSON>, `` are already gone. That's no decision.'' A Monday strike would be the district's first since a 23-day walkout in 1970. <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>'s demand to teachers to hand in their grades by Monday caused <ORGANIZATION> UTLA </ORGANIZATION> to move up its strike deadline from May 30. Classes end June 26 for most schools in the 700-square-mile district, and <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said putting the strike deadline so close to the end of school was extortionate. The district has vowed to keep its 800 elementary and high schools open with substitute teachers who were being mass-hired into the weekend. Officials admitted they may function just a step above baby-sitters. The past week was filled with news conferences and posturing, but little in the way of progress between the sides, which have been bargaining on and off for 16 months. Teachers have been working without a contract for a year. No formal negotiations were scheduled over the weekend, but both sides were meeting informally and talking on the telephone. Still, there was little optimism. `` Doing all that does n't erase a $ 200 million difference,'' said chief district negotiator <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> on Friday. `` People of good faith can talk and meet and do all those things and still not reach an agreement.'' Only late in the week was any move made by state legislators to push for a settlement or find additional money to help the school district meet salary demands. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON>, said the district would get at least $ 34 million in new revenue that could be used for teacher salaries. Asked if students were being used as pawns, <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student body president <PERSON> Yasmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said, `` We are, and we know that this is the only bargaining tool teachers have, so we understand.'' But parents expressed concern. `` I'm not real thrilled about substitutes. I think it's going to be utter chaos,'' said <PERSON> Christen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingman </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, who has two sons in school. `` The teachers are being greedy.'' Instructors want a two-year contract with a 21 percent wage increase. They also want elimination of non-paid teaching duties such as faculty meetings and after-school playground monitoring, plus a say in how their schools are run, an issue called teacher governance. The district has offered a 21.5 percent pay increase over a three-year period, and has offered a teacher governance structure which the <ORGANIZATION> UTLA </ORGANIZATION> has said is too tilted toward administrators. The teachers in March overwhelmingly rejected a district offer for a 20 percent pay raise over three years and voted strike authorization at that time. The issues went to a state fact-finder whose report is due Wednesday. Currently, teachers annually earn from $ 23,440 to $ 43,319. Administrators' salaries start at $ 37,000 and go to $ 95,600 for associate superintendents. <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> earns $ 141,000 as superintendent. Union President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> for the impasse, saying the superintendent has not been flexible enough. But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> admits that his union's derogatory references to <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>'s salary and administration style were aimed at `` pushing his buttons.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in an interview that he has not been able to establish the kind of informal contact with <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> that usually keeps both sides talking. `` I tried that with him,'' he said. `` I gave him my home telephone number, and the only time he called me was because he was furious over some message we put out on our hotline. That made me realize he was sensitive and takes things personally. ... You'd better have a pretty thick hide for that job. Several attempts were made by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> during the past week to reach <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> or get his responses through a representative, all without success. So far, the possibility of a teachers' strike has not aroused parents and legislators as it usually does elsewhere, one observer says. `` In other cities, there's usually a lot of pressure from the parents and business community. You do n't hear much here,'' said <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohlstetter </PERSON>, an assistant professor of education at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Aging Americans Refilling the `Empty Nests' of Mothers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s mothers are finding more than ever that the `` empty nest'' left by grown children is quickly refilled by frail parents or other aging relatives in need of home care, according to a private study. Most alarming, says the Mother's Day report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Older </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, is that while life expectancy increases, the ranks of younger people who can care for the elderly are shrinking, since the baby-boom generation has created a baby bust by having fewer children. Already, Americans 85 and older, the group most in need of long-term care, are the fastest growing segment of the population, with their numbers projected to increase from 2.9 million to 5 million by the year 2,000, the study says. It estimated that the over-65 population, meanwhile, will more than double to 52 million, or one in six people, in the same period. `` On average, women today spend 17 years of their lives caring for children and 18 years assisting aged parents. For the first time ever, American couples have more parents than children. The result will be a significant decline in the number of family caregivers at the same time the need increases dramatically,'' the report said. The study, titled `` Failing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Caregivers: a Status Report on Women Who Care,'' was partially funded by the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revson </PERSON> <PERSON> Foundation </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employes, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. It was derived from census data and a dozens of congressional, academic and other independent studies concerning the elderly, as well as original research by the staff of the Older Women's League, a non-profit advocacy group with more than 120 chapters. OWL President <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON> noted the findings indicate that `` In 1989, a woman whose children are grown has completed, on average, less than half the caregiving she will provide during her life. Far from being free of responsibility, in many cases her most difficult years lie ahead. `` Already,'' she said, `` nearly two million women are part of the ` sandwich' generation, caring simultaneously for children and parents. Millions more go very quickly from child care to elder care. `` Over the next few decades,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON>, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will have fewer caregivers, many more people who need care, and more women in the paid work force with less time to give. If these trends continue, we will face a crisis of enormous proportions.'' The report said that `` while child care has been the work and family conflict of the 1980s ... elder care will be the No. 1 workplace issue of the 1990s, as women struggle to hold paying jobs while caring for elderly parents and spouses.'' Other findings: _ Among children who care for their parents, daughters outnumber sons three to one The average caregiver is 45 years old, female, and married. But 35 percent of caregivers to the elderly are themselves over 65 years old, and 10 percent are over 75. As women outlive men and often marry older men, many become caregivers to their spouses. _ About 89 percent of women over age 18 will provide care to children, parents, or both, and 31 percent will care for both children and parents _ About 52 percent of the married mothers of infants and 55 percent of women caring for elderly relatives are in the work force, and women working full-time are four times more likely to be primary caregivers to the elderly as are working men _ Ninety-five percent of the elderly and 90 percent of the disabled elderly live at home, with family members providing virtually all their care The cost of outside care for the elderly is enormously more expensive than for children. Day care for children averages $ 3,000 annually, compared to $ 25,000 for a nursing home for the elderly. _ During the 1990s, the number of elderly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West will increase about 20 percent, with the greatest increases in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, 70 percent; <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 50 percent; and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 39 percent OWL said the report demonstrates the need for legislation to protect the jobs of people caring for parents and spouses, as well as children, and to provide more federal assistance for the long-term care of the chronically ill.

 The party founded by dictator <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> is poised to return to power for only the second time in three decades on Sunday when Argentines elect a new president. Polls show that voters, upset with a collapsing economy, are likely to favor <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> over <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Peronists </ORGANIZATION> captured a majority of the congressional and gubernatorial races. Voters on Sunday also will elect a vice president, half of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, one national senator, legislatures in 14 of the nation's 22 provinces, and several thousand municipal officials. Voting is obligatory for Argentines between the ages of 18 and 70. About 20 million of the country's 31 million people are eligible. The new president will be inaugurated Dec. 10. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has led public opinion polls since he was nominated by the Peronists in July. But <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> has often reminded voters that President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> also had been expected to lose when he ran in 1983. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a second six-year term. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 58, and <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, 57, both are provincial governors and lawyers. Each is offering a different vision of how <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> might overcome a chronic budget deficit, triple-digit inflation, rising unemployment and a $ 59 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, whose main support comes from the middle class, pledged to sell inefficient state industries, reduce the role of the state in the economy, maintain a free exchange rate, spur exports and revamp organized labor. `` The hour of truth has arrived,'' the stocky, two-time governor of <ORGANIZATION> Cordoba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> said in his final campaign ads. `` There are many ways of voting for the past. There is only one way of voting for the future.'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, whose main support comes from the working poor, recognized the need to balance the national budget but voiced lukewarm support for the privatization of state industries and said he intended to significantly increase wages. The biggest of the approximately 300 companies controlled by the government were nationalized by Gen. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> when he was in power between 1946 and 1955, the year he was ousted by a military coup. Currently, about 2 million Argentines of a work force of about 11 million are employed by the state. To restart the economy, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> pledged to implement a `` productive revolution,'' a concept he never fully explained. `` I am not promising miracles overnight ... I'm not a superman,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told 100,000 cheering supporters at his closing campaign rally on Thursday. `` The only thing I can promise is work, work and more work.'' The main issue in the October 1983 election, which followed brutal military dictatorship, was democracy. At the end of campaigns that were emotional and joyous, Argentines chose <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, an attorney and noted human rights leader. But after five turbulent years marked by 13 general strikes, a devalued currency and three military insurrections, the level of enthusiasm this year has fallen considerably. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> needs more than 50 percent of the electoral college votes to win outright. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> must keep <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> below that figure in order to forge a coalition of other parties and form a majority. A side issue in the campaign this year is the military, which is clamoring for a bigger budget, more political power and an end to the trials of officers accused of anti-leftist human rights violations during the 1976-1983 military dictatorships. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> each has ruled out a pardon for officers convicted of rights abuses. The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claims 4 million members and has been the country's biggest since it was put together by <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. Following his overthrow in September 1955, the party was banned and many of its leaders jailed or exiled. The party was barred from competing in national elections until March 1973, when <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Campora </PERSON> was elected president and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> the governor of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION>, the poor, rural province where he was born. <PERSON> Campora </PERSON> stepped down in favor of <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, who was elected by an overwhelming margin that September. Following <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s death on July 1, 1974, his third wife, <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON>, took over as president. She was deposed by coup in March 1976 and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was jailed during that time.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Voters Asked to Trade Income Tax for Lower Property
Tax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pennsylvanians vote Tuesday on a controversial tax tradeoff that would allow counties to impose local income taxes in exchange for lower property taxes. The measure is the cornerstone of a far-reaching tax overhaul plan proposed by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, but few state officials are expressing confidence that it will pass. Supporters say the plan would produce overall tax cuts, while opponents say most people would end up paying more. Non-partisan experts say the argument is virtually meaningless because the changes would differ from one county to the next. Despite extensive news coverage and advertising about the issue, polls indicate that many voters remain undecided. Voter turnout is expected to be low outside <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where the race for mayor has been strongly contested. `` There's such a tremendous uncertainty out there, it's difficult to say how they are going to go,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Who knows the way this issue will play?'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanko </PERSON>, coordinator for Citizens Against Higher Taxes, which opposes the plan, said he was guardedly optimistic about the outcome of Tuesday's vote. `` We've been given plenty of reasons to be wary,'' he said. `` It's tough to say what will happen over the weekend. ... It's hard to predict. Although the campaign has featured some heated dialogue, the final weekend appeared to be relatively quiet. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> scheduled a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> and both sides planned a flurry of last-minute advertising. The ballot issue would change the state constitution to allow most counties to impose a 0.5 percent income tax, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> counties to impose a 1 percent tax. <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> encompasses <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. It also would allow residential property taxes to be set lower than business property taxes. While the tax plan is the major statewide issue on Tuesday's ballot, there are local measures and mayoral races that also are drawing attention In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> is trying to retain the seat she was appointed to when Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> died last year. Polls have shown her to be running neck-and-neck with <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> controller <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucchino </PERSON> in the Democratic primary election. In Erie, the state's third-largest city, six Democrats and two Republicans are jockeying to succeed Mayor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON>, who is stepping aside to battle the same rare disease, amylodosis, that killed <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>. About 85 percent of the state's communities and three counties also are voting on whether to allow non-profit groups to hold raffles and other small games of chance.

 Two former <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police officers can avoid going to prison for perjury following a judge's order to serve a 120-day sentence of home detention and publicly apologize for lying about their sick leave. <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> received the unusual sentence Friday from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON>. The couple, now married and fired from the force in 1987, were convicted of lying in a discrimination lawsuit they filed with seven other black officers in 1985. The lawsuit, which accused the city of racial bias in hiring and promotions, was later dismissed for unrelated reasons. During the lawsuit, the two said they were harassed by other officers. The two were disciplined when they called in sick in 1983, a day before they were to go on vacation. They told an opposing lawyer in the lawsuit that the sick call was truthful. But records showed the two called in sick from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and had been stopped for speeding the previous day in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Both were convicted of perjury. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was also convicted of making a false statement to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in a discrimination complaint. Each of the crimes was punishable by five years in prison. <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> sentenced the pair to 120 days of home detention, monitored by electronic bracelets, that will allow them to leave only for work or necessities such as grocery shopping. He also ordered 150 hours each of community service and placed them on three years' probation. The apology must be published and be read at police roll calls. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s lawyer said the defendants would appeal their convictions, contending the statements about sick leave were unrelated to the discrimination case and could not be the basis of perjury charges.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Buyout Wave Has Peaked But Business Leaders Unsure</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told business leaders Saturday he believes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has seen the peak in a wave of leveraged buyouts, but the executives said that assessment may be premature. `` We all hope <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> is correct,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But he added there are still `` tremendous amounts of cash out there to keep this LBO, highly leveraged situation going for some period of time.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> addressed a private session of the Business Council, made up of 65 chief executives of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest corporations. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman declined to comment publicly, but <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> had expressed an opinion that debt-financed takeovers will subside because `` the easiest, obvious ones'' already have been done. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> disagreed, saying there are plenty more corporate `` sitting ducks'' that are potential takeover targets. `` I wish Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> were right but I do n't think he's going to be,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> told a news conference after the session. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> gave a similar assessment: `` Hopefully <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> is right but I think that when you look back you see that money markets do not tend to act that rationally.'' In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to buy out stockholders and take over the target company. The new owners often either cut costs or sell off parts of the company to pay back the loans. Critics of the practice fear that high debt levels, particularly in the event of an economic downturn, could endanger both the bought-out company and the financiers of the transaction. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said that while LBO's are likely to persist in the near future, `` over a period of time that is an unsustainable trend.'' `` You create ultimately so much debt that in any recession or any downturn there would be tremendous negative potential repercussions,'' he said. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said that while companies and investment bankers can make `` horrendous sums of money'' on takeovers, the overall effect on the economy is negative because high debt levels force corporations to cut back on investment, research and development. `` America long term is paying a horrible price,'' he said. `` We get short-term gains at the expense of burdening the corporations with tremendous debt.'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said the negative effects of LBOs may have to become more pronounced before the debt-financed takeovers subside. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, R-Calif., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who also spoke to the council, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has considered legislation to cut down on LBOs but is hesitant to make major changes `` The more we hold hearings, the more we know, the less inclined my colleagues are to determine who is and who is not a corporate raider,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` The more we know, the more hesitant we are to move in and make major fundamental changes in the law.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has said on other occasions that LBOs may diminish without congressional action and that restricting the tax deduction for corporate debt could be dangerous to the economy. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said even corporate leaders who are concerned about debt-financed takeovers do n't want legislative relief. `` We do n't want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... getting into the middle to say that this company can not buy this company or this individual can not buy that company,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said `` The free market in the final analyses is the best judge.'' The Business Council was gathered this weekend for its semiannual retreat at a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> resort. On Friday, the group released an economic forecast the predicts a sharp slowdown in growth later this year but an upturn by the end of 1991.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has fired two widely criticized <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers in his first high-level personnel move since rank-and-file soldiers brought him to power eight months ago. The government decree, read Saturday on state radio, came less than six weeks after the Haitian leader narrowly escaped an attempt by some officers to oust him. The two Cabinet members, Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Information Minister <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Pierre </PERSON>, caused a public outcry for their role in granting a safe conduct pass out of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in December to former Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> was indicted for masterminding the massacre of at least 12 parishioners in a slum church. The Sept. 11 massacre outraged soldiers and spurred the ouster of former ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> a week later. Both <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> now live in the neighboring <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ruled this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> turned over power to civilian <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in February 1988 but deposed <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in June. Opposition leaders have persistently demanded the removal of <PERSON> Saint-Pierre </PERSON>, considered one of <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s most influential advisers. In a memorandum to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> leaked to the press in January, <PERSON> Saint-Pierre </PERSON> encouraged the government to repress `` perhaps with bloodshed'' the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Papaye </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, which he accused of subversion. The decree announcing the Cabinet changes, dated Friday, was read by state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION>, privately owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The decree said the new information minister was Ms. <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s sister-in-law and previously a civil servant in the ministry. It said the new foreign affairs minister was <PERSON> Yvon </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrier </PERSON>, formerly the ministry's general director. Soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> blocked an attempted coup by pro-Duvalierist army officers on April 2. The ringleaders were exiled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The coup attempt came four days after <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> fired four officers accused of drug-running. A crackdown on drug trafficking in the army is one of the conditions for the resumption of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspended $ 60 million of a $ 90 million annual aid package after thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations during elections on Nov. 29, 1987. Those elections were canceled. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has pledged to allow free elections, though not for at least two years, and has partially restored <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 1987 constitution.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of activists from throughout the restive Baltic republics gathered for the first time on Saturday to demand economic freedom and an end to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s meddling in their homelands. Leaders of the People's Fronts from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> also drafted a resolution charging that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for perestroika, or restructuring, has failed to curb economic decline. Another resolution claimed the tiny republics have the right to choose any economic system that would meet material needs, protect the environment, and break the stranglehold of Moscow-based planners and officials. `` The only chance we have to get better is to get rid of this vampire that is sucking our blood,'' <PERSON> Dainis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivans </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, told the assembly. `` But we ca n't do it separately, we can only do it together _ as three Baltic sisters. <PERSON> Ivans </PERSON> was among more than 400 activists from the republics who gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, the Estonian capital. After the meeting, the visitors and an estimated 5,000 Estonians rallied in the town square. <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, expressed hope during the meeting that the activists would agree on the creation of a `` real commonwealth of the Baltic peoples.'' Leaders of the People's Fronts have met several times since the groups were founded last autumn in the liberalized political climate fostered by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But this weekend's two-day session in the Estonian capital was the first to bring together members of their rank-and-file. The resolutions defy the ideas of a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> commission on Baltic problems. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan would give control of food and consumer goods to the 15 Soviet republics but keep Moscow-based ministries in charge of energy, defense production and at least half of heavy industry. Baltic activists want complete economic autonomy. They contend Soviet authorities have drained their tiny republics of consumer goods and food to subsidize poorer regions of the country. Lawmakers in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> convene Friday in sessions expected to reject the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan and call for bolder steps. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s draft law gives the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> government control over virtually all industries except defense. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s law declares all its resources `` property of the republic'' and proclaims the right to issue its own currency, said mathematician <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Statulevicius </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> member and deputy in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet legislature. <PERSON> Ceslovas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevicius </PERSON>, a Lithuanian militant from <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, said Lithuanians have been told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had supported the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, when he explained the law to a meeting Friday at the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> But others attending the meeting reportedly opposed it. The law being considered by the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> assembly calls for `` a transition to economic independence'' in the Baltic republics by early 1990. In separate caucusing, more than 80 newly elected members of the new Soviet parliament from the Baltic fronts met to devise a common platform. Another resolution demands that national leaders recognize the `` Stalinist genocide'' in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and convene a trial of its perpetrators. Hundreds of thousands of Baltic residents were deported or killed under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, including 80,000 in 1941 alone, the draft charges. The Baltic republics were forcibly absorbed by the Soviets in 1940 after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> consigned them to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s sphere of influence in a secret deal with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The republics are among several ethnic regions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that are demanding more independence.

<TEXT>
 More than 150 couples who once might have thought they'd never celebrate Mother's Day gathered for a party Saturday with their children conceived through in-vitro fertilization. The families brought about 175 children who were conceived at the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. More than 500 children have been born through the institute, the most successful in-vitro fertilization program in the country. The families are among the lucky few; about 20 percent of the couples who go through the program emerge with a baby. Under the in-vitro process, eggs and sperm are mixed in a petri dish and the fertilized eggs are placed in the uterus. `` I felt I could n't miss this,'' said <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Matawan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, as she held her 1-year-old son, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, at a picnic on the medical school grounds. `` It's nice to see all the successful people together because when you're actually down for a cycle ... you do n't know who's going to be the ones who are going to be successful.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> made five attempts to get pregnant in three in-vitro programs before she succeeded on her second try at the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I had been trying since 1976 to have a baby,'' she said. `` I did n't think I was going to have a biological child.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> went through in-vitro fertilization three times before she got pregnant with triplets, 3-year-old <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. `` I got my money's worth,'' she said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, showed up pushing two double strollers that carried their 21-month-old quadruplets _ <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who was the first to deliver quadruplets in the <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> program, said she had always wanted a large family. `` I could n't go through in vitro four times,'' she said. `` I got it all at once. It was terrific.'' Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the institute's founder, introduced two special guests to the crowd, 7-year-old <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, the country's first `` test-tube'' baby, and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> woman who was the program's first patient. She delivered twins, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in 1985 after eight in-vitro attempts. `` I've told them all along that they're very special to their mommy and daddy, that they are miracle babies and that a doctor helped them to be born,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilisoly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> lawyer, cradled one of the youngest partygoers, 3-month-old <PERSON> Anica </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilisoly </PERSON>. After four years of trying to have a baby, <PERSON> Bilisoly </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowdoin </PERSON>, succeeded on their first attempt at in-vitro fertilization. `` I do n't know if we would have done it again. It's expensive,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bowdoin </PERSON> said. The couple just paid the institute's $ 6,000 bill, none of it covered by insurance. `` You just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bowdoin </PERSON> said. `` I really think it's a roll of the dice.'' Like other in-vitro parents, Bilisoly and Ms. <PERSON> Bowdoin </PERSON> said they plan to tell their daughter that she was conceived in a laboratory. `` I think I'll have her first formal portrait taken holding her petri dish,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bowdoin </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> regained its seat on a major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> institution Saturday, taking a firm step back into the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> fold 10 years after it was ostracized for signing a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. With dissension only from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the 11-member Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries voted to reinstate <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The vote was the clearest signal to date that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was likely to be allowed into a May 23-24 Arab summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s participation would be tantamount to regaining its place in the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, sources say. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was forced out of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and most affiliated institutions after it signed the 1979 Camp David accords with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The boycott gradually eroded with restoration of bilateral ties by most Arab countries and reinstatement of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in several specialized affiliate bodies of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Only <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have taken a hard line against readmitting <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to the Arab fold. At the opening session of the Kuwait-based <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> conference Saturday, chairman <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>, the oil minister of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, called for reinstating <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> family will remain incomplete as long as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> remains outside,'' <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> recently has moderated its stance against <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` I think that no Arab will oppose <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> organizations because <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is a sister state,'' said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> oil minister, <PERSON> Mutanius </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> shortly after arriving. The conference communique mentioned that <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshouki </PERSON> expressed reservations about readmitting <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> but did not say what they were. <PERSON> Shakshouki </PERSON> said before the conference began that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> still opposed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s reinstatement and said his country would continue to do so `` as long as the causes of its suspension did not vanish.'' <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1968 by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a forum for promoting Arab oil policies. Other members are <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 Hundreds of people on Saturday demonstrated for the elimination of nuclear weapons to prevent another accident like the recently disclosed loss of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bomb near <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 24 years ago. About 500 demonstrators marched through downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with a dummy nuclear bomb and banners reading `` Remove nuclear arms'' and `` Let's repeal the U.S.-Japan security treaty.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military said Monday that an A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying the bomb fell off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier <LOCATION> Ticonderoga </LOCATION> in 1965 about 80 miles from a small island in southern <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, is especially sensitive about any kind of danger from nuclear arms, and the disclosure has revived debate on the role of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` I got really angry when I heard about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accident,'' said demonstrator <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, who was a victim of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bombing of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> near the end of World War II. `` No one can make accident-proof nuclear weapons,'' said <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, 62. Following the rally, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> and Hydrogen Bombs, anti-nuclear protesters began a march from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, 430 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been drifting away from the go-it-alone Latin American policies favored by the previous administration and his cautious approach was underscored in addressing the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> appear to have concluded that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration failed to achieve its goals in the region because it refused to take into account the wishes of either the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or of hemispheric countries. So the emphasis has been on working with both in the hopes of coming up with more effective policies. A bipartisan agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already is in place on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> consulted closely with lawmakers this past week after the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> became tumultuous. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the will of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people was thwarted by `` massive fraud'' in the immediate aftermath of Sunday's election and by the subsequent decision of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to throw out the returns. He also condemned the violence directed at opposition leaders on Wednesday. In support of the American `` commitment to democracy'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a seven-step plan the following day which won plaudits from both the Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But little of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did seemed to pose a threat to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Some of the measures will have no effect at all, including the president's recall of Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. A recall of an ambassador is often used in diplomacy to register displeasure with the country in question but <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has had no contact at all with the Noriega-led government in more than 14 months. On Saturday, however, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to be trying to turn up the heat on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying, `` The Panamanian people should do everything to get him out of office.'' Speaking with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, the president declined to back away from his words when reporters raised questions about the strength of his language. `` No, I would add no words of caution,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` The will of the people should be implemented.'' At another point, the president said: `` I would love to see him out of there, we'd like to see him out. The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and his ... thugs.'' He said he was making the statement to make clear to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people that they still had the affection of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said sending additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> should not be viewed as outside intervention and said `` we would have good relations with the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people and the PDF'' _ the military _ if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were thrown from office. The most controversial measure announced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the dispatch of a brigade of American military personnel but he linked that move to the need to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, not to promote democracy there. No new economic sanctions were announced against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> merely said existing sanctions will continue in force. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ruled out a more heavy-handed approach, realizing there are few issues around which Latin Americans rally more quickly than opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interventionism. Thus, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected use of force against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as well as the scrapping of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. There was little support in the administration for a total trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. That approach would set back <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy for years _ damaging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in the process _ with no guarantee <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be forced out, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to place his strongest hopes for a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on diplomacy but made it clear the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will leave it to other countries to take the lead `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strongly supports, and will cooperate with initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address the crisis,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Less than 24 hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> convened to take up a <LOCATION> Venezuelan </LOCATION> proposal to hold an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meeting on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation. At the conclusion of the two-hour session, the 31 delegates unanimously approved a meeting for this coming Wednesday. This will be perhaps the first major test for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s stated preference for diplomatic approaches. In a speech two weeks ago, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> alluded to the widespread desire for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to forgo unilateral measures but cautioned alternative approaches may have drawbacks as well. `` All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to the region's conflicts now have a responsibility to prove this is the best and the surest route to achieve our common goals,'' he said. Privately, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are skeptical that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting will conclude with an unambiguous condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> charter calls representative democracy `` an indispensable condition'' for peace in the hemisphere, it also stresses that the principle of non-intervention must be respected as well. This latter point was emphasized repeatedly during Friday's permanent council meeting, with countries as diverse as <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> alluding to it In the days prior to the meeting, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegates will be lobbying hard for a resolution which, at a minimum, denounces <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, while other delegates will be attempting to promote as bland a declaration as possible. It is generally agreed that failure by the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to confront <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> squarely on the events of this past week could lead to a reassessment of the administration's goal of governing on the basis of broad consensus rather than unilateral action.

<HEAD>Soviet Troops Begin to Leave Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet soldiers, who first arrived 21 years ago to crush political reforms, began a partial pullout Saturday that generated little apparent enthusiasm among the country's communist leaders. State-run media noted tersely that a Soviet battalion stationed in the north Moravian city of <LOCATION> Olomouc </LOCATION>, close to the border with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, left for home early Saturday. Local Communist Party officials bade the departing 6.5-mile column farewell in a short ceremony, the reports said. It was not known how many troops left Saturday. The little attention given to the departure contrasted markedly with the treatment given the Soviet pullout from neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In an opposition march through <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in March, some 100,000 people called for a complete withdrawal of Soviet troops and greater independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The withdrawals come as part of a pullout of 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> announced by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is to withdraw half a million men over the next two years in a unilateral reduction seen by Western analysts as directed at aiding new talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The estimated 80,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> began entering the country on Aug. 20, 1968 in a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed reforms ushered in by then-Communist Party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. The invasion led eventually to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s ouster and the expulsion of almost half a million communists from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s ruling party. Under the current withdrawal, 5,300 Soviet troops, 708 tanks and 20 planes are to leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Only four battalions _ some 1,500 men _ will depart this year, according to figures given in February by Czechoslovak chief of staff Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON>. The partial Soviet pullout began in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> last month with the departure of 31 T-64 tanks.

 Flatbed trucks laden with armored personnel carriers rumbled down a central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> highway Saturday on the first stage of a trip to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The equipment will be used by more than 700 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> who began leaving early Saturday for the troubled Central American nation. The atmosphere was businesslike at a lot where 53 track-driven personnel carriers were driven from a concrete loading dock onto trucks and across <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>. The trucks and Jeeps then headed out in convoys for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Some of the camouflage-clad soldiers admitted to a touch of nerves at being part of what base historian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said was the first potential combat assignment for the 5th Infantry Division -LRB- Mechanized -RRB- since its activation at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> in the mid-1970s. `` My dad told me, ` Do n't be a hero,''' Spec. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION> said as he loaded one of his unit's trucks for the 100-mile trip to <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the vehicles were to be loaded on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cargo ship <PERSON> Bellatrix </PERSON>. The Fort Polk contingent, which includes about 20 women, is among nearly 2,000 soldiers whom President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to help protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens from post-election violence. The largest single group, nearly 1,000, left Friday from <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I hope and pray that they are not going to get into a position where there's actual combat. I hope that their presence is all that is required down there to do whatever it is that we need to do,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the division commander. Sgt. <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said he was n't going and envied those who were. `` Everybody would like to go. It's the chance of a lifetime,'' he said. Friday evening, 140 soldiers kissed spouses goodbye, held children up in the fading light and made early Mother's Day telephone calls. Some punched each others' arms and exchanged `` high fives.'' Some of them had already flown to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Saturday morning, before the convoys of those going by ocean rolled out the gate at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, according to Maj. <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a spokesman for the base. Only 12 of the soldiers driving to <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> were to get on the Bellatrix with the trucks, armored personnel carriers and mortar carriers, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. The remaining roughly 575 will fly to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> early in the week so that they will arrive at the same time as their equipment, he said. Soldiers strapping armored vehicles onto flatbeds or readying the convoys said they had been told the assignment in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could last anywhere from one to six months. Army Capt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> port said he did not know when the <PERSON> Bellatrix </PERSON> was scheduled to leave.

 A widower and his 11 children have sued police because the man's wife collapsed and died of a heart attack when officers chased a burglary suspect into the family's house. State Rep. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> filed the lawsuit Friday on behalf of <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and his children. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s wife, 58-year-old <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, died March 29, five days after she collapsed from a heart attack during questioning about <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, who had run into her house during a chase. The officers, armed with guns and sticks, went in after him without Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s permission, the suit alleges. The city attorney's office said in a statement Wednesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> told officers, `` Get him out of here, he does not belong here.'' That gave the officers permission to enter, the statement said. The lawsuit charges that the four officers had been asked to enter quietly because Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had heart problems, but that they had ignored the warning and pushed Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> aside as they dashed in.

 A brawl between 300 Armenians and Azerbaijanis injured five people in continued ethnic strife in the region, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday. The fight on Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an Armenian enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, was accompanied by continuing strikes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not give more details. More than 90 people died in ethnic clashes in the neighboring republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> last year, stemming in part from Armenian demands for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. On Thursday, 300,000 Armenians demonstrated in their capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to demand action on the dispute. <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s hand-picked administrator for the area, confronted `` 700 extremely agitated people'' in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>'s central square Thursday night and calmed them before the crowd turned violent, the news agency said <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON> appeared on local television Friday night to appeal for an end to the strikes that are hampering his attempts to ease economic problems in the area. He said desperately needed housing construction has been halted, and a water-well drilling team from central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> was unable to work because its equipment was held up by the work stoppages. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> accused the activists of trying to close a clinic and to involve schoolchildren in the strikes.

 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s role in the Panamanian election crisis has thrust him back onto the international stage eight years after leaving the presidency, and he says his relationship with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` infinitely better'' than his relationship with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a frequent and harsh critic of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after losing to him in the 1980 election, lead a team of international observers monitoring the national elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week and later briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was one of the topics that most bitterly divided <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, so <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s role in helping to serve as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s eyes and ears in the Central American nation vividly illustrates the change in his relationship from one administration to the next. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in an interview Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was receptive to what he had to say even though he was n't part of the official team of observers chosen by the president. `` It's infinitely better,'' he said. `` I had no relationship with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at all.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s statements in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, in which he accused the government there of stealing the election, drew international attention. Those who have n't followed <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s activities may have thought he was re-emerging from a somnolent retirement. But in fact, the former president has been an active, if unofficial, player in world affairs since he left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1981. Operating mainly out of the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, he has pursued favorite causes and offered the resources of his facility as an aid in mediating international disputes. `` I do n't care for any official role,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, speaking from his hometown of <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` I'm operating now in the same way that I've been for the last six or seven years. I think if I had an official role to play, it might hamper my freedom and limit greatly what influence or access I do have.'' In the past few years, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has maintained an active schedule of speaking and traveling. In the past year alone, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, he has been to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Panamanian situation has special importance to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. In 1977, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> signed an agreement with the late Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> under which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is due to take control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in 1999. `` Carter views the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties as one of his most significant achievements, and all this represents some threat to his achievements,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Although some observers have questioned whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should still honor the treaty with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s abuses of power, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would alienate the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people and `` every other nation in this hemisphere'' if it abrogated the pact. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaty was bitterly opposed by conservatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> foremost among them, and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s return to the limelight opened some old wounds for those who worked against the pact. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a conservative political analyst in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, suggested that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week amounted to his `` returning to the scene of a political crime.'' `` A crumbling <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a fitting place for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to re-emerge,'' he added. `` It will be difficult for him to be taken seriously once we move along.'' But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> apparently is being taken seriously by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. In one sign of respect that would have been unthinkable in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> uears, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was a main speaker last month at a <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> conference on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In recent speeches, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a Democrat, has commented favorably on the Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And he has expressed agreement with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response to the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which included the dispatching of additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops

<HEAD>Motion Filed to Halt Pupil Assignment Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys in the 1974 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> school desegregation case are seeking a court order to block a new student assignment plan that they fear could lead to further exodus of white students from inner-city schools. The lawyers, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON>, filed a motion Friday with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, asking him to intervene and stop the student assignment plan. `` As this plan is now drafted, it will result in rapid resegregation of the schools in minority neighborhoods,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. `` Whites will choose schools near their homes because they'll have no basis to choose schools elsewhere. City officials and the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> devised the plan in an attempt to end 15 years of court-ordered busing. It would divide the city into three zones and allow parents to choose a school within their zone, as long as student populations remain within racial balance. Busing was violently opposed in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> ordered it in the mid-1970s. Supporters of the new plan say the competition among schools would spur improvement, lure whites back to the system and cut long bus rides. But opponents say it could be a back door to segregation and wo n't work without more money to improve the overall system. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schools now are struggling with a budget crunch. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> defended the plan. `` The <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been informed by our legal staff there's nothing unconstitutional about what we've done,'' he said. `` We will defend it to every degree possible.'' Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> was active in creation of the plan and pushed for its implementation this fall. He said parents want more say in their children's education. `` It is unfortunate that, once again, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> parents have to deal with the uncertainties of a legal proceeding,'' he said. The plan was approved 9-4 by the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with all four of the committee's black members voting against it. At that time, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON> agreed to take part in a 90-day review that ended last week. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said Friday that the plan was implemented too quickly and parents did n't get enough information to make good choices. The plan is scheduled to begin for students entering elementary schools this fall, and parents of those children already have received applications for schools. Critics of the plan say more time is needed for parents to understand how to choose their children's school. `` There's so much confusion out there now,'' said <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Citywide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which has voted to recommend a one-year delay of the plan.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> authorized a bank to handle more than $ 1 million in transportation funds in 1984, five years before the date he claimed he first learned the bank had any business with the city, a federal document revealed. The document, obtained from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, was an authorization form signed by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> in 1984 that allowed $ 1,339,230 in federal transportation funds earmarked for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to be deposited in <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The document was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> and passed on to City Councilwoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milke </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. The councilwoman introduced it during hearings Friday on <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s financial dealings. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who was paid $ 18,000 last year for his work as an adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, has said he did n't know until earlier this year that the bank had any dealings with the city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s financial dealings with Far East and with <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan, which paid him $ 24,000 a year as a board member until he resigned earlier this year, are being investigated by City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. Also Friday, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s office confirmed it has launched a second investigation of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, this one to determine whether the mayor accepted illegal contributions during his re-election campaign earlier this year. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> won in a landslide. `` I can say that we have asked the city clerk to provide us with information regarding some campaign contributions from the recently concluded mayoral campaign,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. City Clerk <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> ordered him to audit certain contributions made to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>.

He said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> would not discuss it. `` The responsibility would seem to fall on the people who contribute and not the mayor for accepting the money,'' he said. Friday's hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Governmental Operations committee, at which the transportation funds document was discussed, was held to review the status of <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s probe into <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s finances. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said the mayor would not answer any questions about his involvement with <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> has completed that investigation.

<TEXT>
 `` Nimrod Dancer,'' the name of the operation that dispatched 2,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is the latest in a long list of fanciful, hokey and sometimes incongruous codes used by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to describe its missions. `` Nimrod Dancer _ did n't he come in seventh at the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Derby?'' a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official was overheard to wonder when word of the operation's code name was announced Thursday. <PERSON> Nimrod </PERSON>, the Bible tells us, was a mighty hunter. Was he a dancer too? `` No,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` These names are n't supposed to mean anything. They have absolutely no significance on the face of it.'' To make sure the names are totally random, a computer picks them, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. But once chosen, the combination of words, the number of their syllables or some other pattern does have significance for `` those who need to know,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON>. Or, as explained in The Encyclopedia of Code Names of World War II, codes serve `` as a type of mental shorthand for those in the know and to obfuscate the issue for those not in the know.'' <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, the master tactician who led the Allies to victory over <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War II, may not have approved of the way codes are selected nowadays. In instructions to Gen. Sir <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismay </PERSON> in August 1943, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> wrote: `` Operations ought not to be described by code words which imply a boastful and overconfident sentiment. ... They ought not to be names of frivolous characters. They should not be ordinary words. Names of living people should be avoided.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also avoids the names of living people for operation names. But what would Churchill have made of Operation `` Urgent Fury,'' the code name for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983 to counter a Cuban-backed coup and evacuate American medical students? While names like `` Urgent Fury'' may sound inspirational, their aim is purely operational. `` You have to have a code name to use in communications during an operation,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blechman </PERSON>, an expert on defense issues at the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Major operations have different code names for each component, he said. `` One must be precise. If you use the wrong name, you could land a unit at the wrong place or bomb the wrong target.'' Before computers got in on the act, some operation names actually had meaning the public at large could understand. For instance, an operation mounted in 1968 by the 196th Light Infantry Brigade in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was code named `` <LOCATION> Attleboro </LOCATION>,'' after the town in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> where the unit had trained. In a more figurative although still understandable name, Operation Niagara in January 1968 conducted an average of 300 bombings daily in support of a besieged Marine base at <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The bombs rained down like a water fall, get it? Former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> liked to keep his hand in on code name selections during the Vietnam War. There was Linebacker One, for a bombing operation, and then Linebacker Two for another one. In the old days, some names appeared to reflect the portentous character of the operation, like a drumbeat roll. One of the most famous World War II code names was `` Operation Overlord,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> landing on the coast of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> as part of the Allied counteroffensive that rolled back Nazi forces from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Animals seem to be a favorite for code names of recent years. Operation `` Golden Pheasant'' was the 1988 deployment of 3,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as a show of force against an alleged Nicaraguan incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` Praying Mantis,'' the insect that eats other insects, was the name used for the 1988 operation in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gunboats and aircraft destroyed or sank six Iranian naval vessels and two oil platforms in retaliation for a mine attack on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship. And in the same waters, `` Earnest Will'' was the operation in which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships escorted <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers in 1987 to protect them against attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which was at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Some servicemen believed the name described the fortitude needed to undertake the dangerous mission, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Eagle Claw'' was the disastrous 1980 operation to rescue American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The mission was aborted after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter collided with a C-130 transport aircraft and eight servicemen were killed in the ensuing fire at a remote staging area code-named Desert One. Then there was `` Eldorado Canyon'' _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of Libyan targets in April 1986 in which an F-111 fighter was shot down and its two crew members killed.

 An eight-member international team has reached within a day's walk from the North Pole on a 620-mile trek to underscore the dangers of global pollution, the mission's headquarters said Saturday The mission's co-ordinating office in this Canadian capital said the team was expected to complete its trip and return Monday by plane to <LOCATION> Ellesmere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION>. It began its journey there March 20. The current mission, known as <PERSON> Icewalk </PERSON>, was designed to be different from previous expeditions by making use of only human power. The group planned its mission with skies and sledges for supplies, but without dogsleds or skimobiles. Along the way, the team has done tests for pollution in an effort to publicize the dangers of global warming, known as the greenhouse effect, and of Arctic pollution. The group includes members from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A pair of newly discovered 400-year-old German paintings highlights a collection belonging to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., that goes on display Sunday at the National Gallery of Art The finding of the two paintings was reported by <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON>, a leading authority on northern European art who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goeteborg </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hana </PERSON> <PERSON> Seifertova </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> turned up the two paintings in poor condition at the little-known Slovak National Gallery in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The paintings date from 1595, but generally are considered as belonging to the 17th century because of their style. `` They are some of the most important paintings done in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in their century,'' <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON> said in an interview. He explained that although an earlier period had been rich in German painters, including <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> <PERSON> Duerer </PERSON>, artistic activity in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was slow at the time because of intense religious war. The two newly found paintings are believed part of a set of four, representing the seasons, done in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There were two collaborating artists, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valckenborch </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION> in what is now <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Flegel </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Olomouc </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Olmuetz </LOCATION> -RRB- in what is now <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Though called still life paintings, they include large and colorful human figures and are themselves unusually large _ about 47 by 75 inches. The paintings represent Summer and Autumn. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valckenborch </PERSON> painted the figures and <PERSON> Flegel </PERSON> the still life parts. In the <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> collection `` Still Lifes of the Golden Age,'' the `` Allegory of Summer'' is almost precisely like one of the two newly discovered paintings. <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON> said he believes that picture was part of a set painted earlier than the set containing the two found in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. Autumn looks like a fat hunter with game birds hanging from his belt and a handsome young woman in a starched ruff. `` It may be the same model as in Summer,'' said <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON>. There are also great baskets of fruit and vegetables, and two highly detailed landscapes in the background. When first found it was so covered with grime that only the woman's head and few baskets of fruit could be easily made out. It has now been restored. <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON> hopes some day a complete set of four can be assembled in a single exhibit. For now, visitors to the National Gallery's East Building can see Summer and 43 other paintings from the <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> collection _ mostly flowers and food _ by painters of the 17th century from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Flanders </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, who belongs to the food-manufacturing family, started buying them when he was a student. <PERSON> Bergstroem </PERSON> says it is the biggest of the world's four main collections of its kind. The show will remain at the National Gallery until Sept. 4, then will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from Oct. 18 to Dec. 31.

<HEAD>Doctor, Fired for Praying With Patients, Claims Rights Violated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A doctor who says he was fired by a hospital for praying at patients' bedsides has filed a civil rights complaint accusing the institution of religious discrimination. Dr. <PERSON> Ju </PERSON> <PERSON> Woong </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>, 51, said in the complaint filed with the state <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> this month that he had prayed with patients for 10 years while on the staff of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luke </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with no problems. <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> was fired in February by hospital President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who cited him for insubordination and willful neglect of duty. Hospital officials said the dismissal followed repeated warnings about praying with patients. In his complaint, the Korean-born <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> said he fulfilled his duties to his patients and that he discussed his beliefs and prayed with patients only with their consent in order to comfort them. <PERSON> Bartell </PERSON> said Saturday that attorneys had advised him not to comment on the matter. `` However, as you well know, there are two sides to every story,'' he said. <PERSON> Bartell </PERSON> said the hospital, once affiliated with the Lutheran church, is owned by a non-profit private organization `` with a Christian commitment'' but not tied to any religious denomination. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s has no formal policy on staff members praying with patients, he said. <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> said he began praying with patients in 1974. `` Everybody knows I pray,'' he said. In 1981, the hospital gave <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> a Courtesy in Action award for `` reflecting <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s love.'' Six years later, <PERSON> Bartell </PERSON> told the doctor to seek patients' permission to pray with them <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> agreed to do so. The physician said his dismissal stemmed from an incident in January and another in February. In the first case, <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> said he discussed <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> but did not pray with a 14-year-old patient after noting the boy's religious denomination on his medical form. In the second case, he said, he went to Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON>'s room on Feb. 10 when <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON> complained of chest pains, ordered pain medication and an electrocardiogram, then suggested prayer `` I wanted to comfort him,'' <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON> agreed. However, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s said <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>'s Bible reading became prolonged and distracting and distressed <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON> said in a written account of the incident that he asked <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> to stop and <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> did. In firing <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>, the hospital also cited a Feb. 6 incident in which <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> treated a patient with acupuncture, which St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s does not permit <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> has acknowledged he used acupuncture, but said it only happened once and is not the central issue in his dismissal. In 1986, another doctor complained that <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> upset a terminally ill patient and the man's wife by asking him if he believed in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and wanted to pray. <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> was also suspended for three days in 1986 for incidents in October and November of that year in which he discussed religious beliefs with two patients. He prayed with only one. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which represents doctors who profess faith in Christ, believes spiritual issues are a crucial part of health, said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Habecker </PERSON>, director of the <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, Texas-based organization. `` You do need to be careful in this culture to ask permission,'' <PERSON> Habecker </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have the right to run up and down hospital corridors and force <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> on other people in that sense.''

<HEAD>Jewish Group Cancels Meeting With Pope in Flap Over Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Jewish leaders canceled a meeting with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> after the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said it would not discuss a Roman Catholic convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> that has offended many Jews, a group official said Saturday. Jewish groups are upset about the presence of a dozen Carmelite nuns on the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which has become a memorial to the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said group members from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were to meet the pope Friday at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for three purposes: to compliment his recent document on racism, to ask him to consider the situation of Jews in upcoming documents, and to discuss the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> dispute. But <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said that in talks last week at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> said church leaders had not approved of the agenda. `` He indicated that things could n't go ahead under those terms,'' the Jerusalem-based representative said in a telephone interview in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` We decided we're not going to hide our agenda.'' He said the Anti-Defamation League, which originally requested the meeting, decided to put if off indefinitely. `` It was obvious if everyone was insistent, there was going to be a clash,'' he said. He added, however, that his group remains `` completely committed to the continuity of the dialogue'' between the faiths. He said the disagreement would not hinder fruitful discussion of other issues. A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman could not be reached for comment Saturday. Jewish leaders have expressed outrage that the Carmelite convent has remained at the Polish site of the death camp despite a 1987 pact with Roman Catholic leaders to move the convent by early this year. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders say the nuns' new quarters are not ready.

<TEXT>
 Afghan rebels said Saturday that 30,000 guerrillas are preparing to attack this capital city soon, but the foreign minister of the Soviet-backed government scornfully dismissed the claim. Officials in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, however, said they wanted to extend a state of emergency they had hoped not to renew. They cited a threat of attack by neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where most of the rebels are based. The threat of an offensive against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was reported by the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which quoted guerrilla commander <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>. Neither the news agency nor guerrilla sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said exactly when the attack would be mounted. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> claimed that more than 1,000 `` employees'' of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government had agreed to cooperate with the U.S.-backed guerrillas. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has insisted his forces are strong enough to withstand a rebel onslaught. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues to arm the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, although the last of more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord. The ruling communist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> seized power in a 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem insurgency which aims to establish an Islamic republic. The guerrillas have tried for the past nine weeks without success to take the eastern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, Afghan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> dismissed the threat of a similar attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which has been quiet in recent weeks. `` They are welcome. We are looking forward -LRB- to this -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said in a mixture of English and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> language. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> met Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and other officials during a 12-hour stop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The Afghan foreign minister said he expected <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to increase its shipments of food and medicine to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but he gave no dates or figures. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is the only non-Soviet bloc country known to be sending aid to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Moscow-style government. The Afghan government also said Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> will be convened this month and asked to extend the state of emergency. It gave no date for the meeting, but the emergency rules were to expire May 20. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the government had hoped to allow the emergency to expire. But he said reports that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was planning to attack <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> made an extension necessary. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared the emergency Feb. 18, three days after the last Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said the government needed the special authority because of the threat of foreign aggression and subversive activities by the rebels. The elders, whose number varies from 1,200 to 3,000, include regional officials, the mayor of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the prime minister, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> members, the attorney general, and 50 people picked by the president. In addition to adopting states of emergency, they are empowered to amend the constiution, elect the president, and declare war.

 A British man was missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Saturday, hours after a group claimed to have taken a hostage to win freedom for `` comrades'' jailed in the slaying of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> cartoonist in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Also Saturday, a German newspaper reported that a West German man who disappeared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on May 4 had signed a letter saying he was abducted in connection with the case of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. There has been no claim of responsibility for the West German, <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Quint </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said West German security officials believe <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> was kidnapped by <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> associates. A Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said `` it would not be in the interest of solving the case'' to comment on the newspaper report. The missing Briton is 83-year-old <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday. A previously unheard of group, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION>, sent a statement to a Western news agency a few hours after <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was last seen, claiming responsibility for an abduction but not identifying the victim. In its Arabic statement, the group said: `` We declare our readiness to immediately release the captive if the British government announces the beginning of a fair trial for our comrades. `` We ask the British government to release our comrades detained without evidence on charge of assassinating comrade <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ali </PERSON>.'' The Palestinian political cartoonist died Aug. 30, 1987, after being shot outside the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> offices of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas. The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed he `` died at the hands of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service -RRB- <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> in cooperation with the British intelligence to drive a wedge and deepen differences within <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ranks.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> said no one has ever been arrested or charged for the cartoonist's death and the murder remains unsolved. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the Arabic statement is `` the only indication we have so far that <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> may have been kidnapped.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> warned all its nationals out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after a string of kidnappings, but the <PERSON> Manns </PERSON> said in a recent interview that after 40 years in the city they were too old to move and of little value as hostages. Police said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was an air force pilot during World War II and then worked as a pilot for <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s national carrier. He also worked as a bartender at west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Pickwick Pub after retiring from the airline, they said. Not counting <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quint </PERSON>, there are 15 foreigners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was seized March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sunny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, said her husband left their apartment in the seaside Raouche area at 11 a.m. Friday to go to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a little over a mile away. An employee at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> did not enter the bank Friday. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucknott </PERSON>, vice consul at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the embassy had no information other than Mrs. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s report that her husband had disappeared. <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> disappeared May 4 along with two other West German relief workers in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The other two reappeared safely. Palestinian guerrilla leaders said unidentified kidnappers were holding <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> in connection with the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> case. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> said the West German embassy in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> received a letter written in English and signed by <PERSON> Quint </PERSON>. It said a second letter not signed by <PERSON> Quint </PERSON> was sent to West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. `` In both letters it is indicated that the kidnapping is connected to the trial of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>,'' it said. `` The kidnappers are demanding a mild sentence for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> faces life in prison if convicted of murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the slaying of an American sailor on board. He confessed to the hijacking but denies taking part in the murder. He is on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

The polls also showed divided opinion on whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should honor a 1978 treaty that eventually turns over control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll taken over three days found that on Tuesday and Wednesday, 39 percent of those surveyed supported sending troops and 44 percent were opposed. But on Thursday, when three-fifths said they had heard about the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> crisis, 53 percent said they supported dispatching <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops while 34 percent were opposed. A <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll to be published Monday, however, found that 59 percent of those surveyed said they were against the use of military force. Most Americans, 71 percent, trusted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to handle the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> crisis, the survey found. The Times-CBS poll also showed that 58 percent of those surveyed said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should adhere to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll, however, indicates that 51 percent said the process of turning over control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> should be stopped. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated that 71 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> think it is `` very important'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to give up power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Eighty-one percent said the best response would be to have other nations in the region pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into giving up power. The <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll of 750 adults nationwide has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. The Times-CBS News poll of 1,073 adults nationwide has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Pope Applauds Liturgical Reform But Complains of Abuses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> embraced reform of the Mass in an apostolic letter released Saturday but also warned of `` outlandish innovations'' and other excesses. The pope said the changes in church ceremonies mandated by the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65 were intended to help renew the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. He said the vast majority of pastors and other Catholics have accepted the reforms with joy. `` The word of God is now better known in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> communities,'' he wrote. However, the pontiff warned of `` outlandish innovations, departing from the norms of the Apostolic See or the bishops.'' He said such changes were `` disrupting the unity of the church and the piety of the faithful and even on occasion contradicting matters of faith.'' The Second Vatican Council introduced the Mass in the language of worshipers instead of Latin, and it called for the priest to face the congregation rather than keep his back to it. Lay people also were permitted to perform Bible readings. Some traditionalists resented the changes and fought to keep the Latin, or Tridentine, Mass, which dates from Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> in 1570. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has acknowledged their attachment to the old Mass but has limited its use. Last year, Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and a Swiss-based group of traditionalists split with the church over the issue. In his letter, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> addressed the 25th anniversary of `` Sancrosanctum Concilium,'' the document on liturgical reform he called the `` first fruit'' of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> II. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the application of the reforms has been marked by a `` tendency to see religious practice as something of a private affair, by a certain rejection of institutions, by a decrease in the visibility of the church in society, and by a calling into question of personal faith.'' He stressed that only the church hierarchy has the power to alter the liturgy, not priests or other church groups. He said some innovations could even affect the validity of the sacraments. `` On occasion, there have been noted illicit omissions or additions, rites invented outside the framework of established norms, postures or songs which are not conducive to faith or to a sense of the sacred, abuses in the practice of general absolution ...'' he wrote. `` It can not be tolerated that certain priests should take upon themselves the right to compose eucharistic prayers or to substitute profane readings for texts from sacred scripture. `` Initiatives of this sort, far from being linked with the liturgical reform as such ... are in direct contradiction to it, disfigure it and deprive the Christian people of the genuine treasures of the liturgy of the church,'' he said. He called for bishops to root out such abuses. However, he encouraged continued adaptation of the liturgy to different cultures and languages. He also appealed for church members `` to renew that spirit which inspired the church'' during the early days of reform.

<HEAD>Sailor Recalls Lost-Bomb Incident as `Dreamy Memory'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The image of a jet falling into the sea off <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> while carrying a hydrogen bomb had become `` a dreamy memory'' for a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran until the loss was disclosed more than two decades later. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> said he watched in 1965 as the A-4E Skyhawk attack jet slipped over the side of the aircraft carrier <PERSON> Ticonderoga </PERSON> after a nuclear bomb 70 times more powerful than the one dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> had been loaded aboard the plane. Driving to work this week, the <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> man heard a radio report about newly released documents confirming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lost the bomb in international waters about 70 or 80 miles from <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> when he was a 21-year-old sailor on the carrier. `` There is a bomb at the bottom of the ocean with a plane attached to it with a body in it,'' said <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON>, the district manager of a consumer electronics firm here. Pentagon officials have confirmed the accident but released few details. The Japanese government requested an explanation and Okinawans expressed anger over the secret handling of the loss in nearby waters. Until the news reports, the accident had come to seem like `` a dreamy memory,'' <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> said in an interview published Saturday in the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` What I saw was real,'' said <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON>, now 44. `` I saw it happen.'' <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> sat beside a stack of scrapbooks from his four years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as he described the accident, pointing out his photo in a yearbook on Ticonderoga cruises. `` It was 23 years ago. It was a beautiful day. The plane just rolled backwards off the ship. There was no wind,'' he said. Stars and Stripes, the unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military newspaper, reported Friday that brake failure or a distracted pilot may have caused the jet to drop overboard as it was being prepared for takeoff and being put on an elevator to the flight deck. The carrier was steaming toward <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a few days of rest after combat in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> learned later that the pilot was planning to meet his wife in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The pilot was sitting there minding his own business, and the ship took a slow roll into the ocean,'' he said. The plane `` trapped the pilot because it was a clamshell cockpit.'' <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> said he and others on board knew the ship was carrying nuclear wearpons, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never admitted it publicly. Trying to reconstruct the events leading to the accident, <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> said he thought a weapons-loading drill had just concluded, and sailors were pushing the jet into place, about to chain it down, when it flipped off the edge of the ship's port side. The aircraft sank quickly and efforts to retrieve it failed. `` The plane hit the water. It was gone. It disappeared,'' <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> said. He said the accident was memorable for its unexpectedness. `` When people died, usually it was a hectic situation, a flight, a landing,'' <PERSON> Dehnert </PERSON> said. `` But we were going to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, everyone was relaxed. We were sunning ourselves.''

<TEXT>
 The rear stairway door of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying 59 people opened in mid-flight Saturday, but the plane flew the remaining 300 miles to its destination and landed safely, an official said. The incident caused no pressure problems in the cabin of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 en route from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> because an inside door separated the cabin from the outside air, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a control tower supervisor at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The door that opened was attached to stairs and used as an emergency exit or occasional alternate entrance to the plane, he said. `` They -LRB- door and stairs -RRB- just dropped open,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` For whatever reason, the latch did not hold it.'' The plane was being repaired Saturday evening and was expected to leave the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> airport for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> at 6:50 p.m. _ an hour late, said a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> ticket agent who would not give his name. Long said Flight 402 had left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and was flying over <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> about 4:30 p.m. with 51 passengers and eight crew members aboard when the pilot radioed the tower to say the stairway door had opened. The pilot indicated he would fly the remaining distance, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Firefighters were called to the Columbus airport runway and crash equipment was brought out as a precaution, he said. The plane landed safely about 5:15 p.m. `` The pilot was n't excited, so I did n't get excited,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Panamanian Opposition Calls for General Strike, Isolation of Noriega</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with opposition calling for general
strike and diplomatic, political quarantine on Noriega regime. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The opposition called Saturday for a one-day general strike and asked the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to impose what amounts to a diplomatic and political quarantine on Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` A general strike is a cry ... for democratic solidarity with the people of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and of the world,'' said first vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>. In a statement signed by <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and second vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the opposition asked all Panamanians to back a strike on Wednesday. `` We ask everyone at 12 noon of that day to go out on the streets and protest in his own street or his own neighborhood,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said. The protest is to coincide with a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss the Panamanian situation. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> also asked people to protest the nullification of May 7 election results after church services on Sunday. However, he did not say how they should protest, and he said nothing of what opposition leaders would do Wednesday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while flying to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, urged Panamanians and the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to `` do everything'' to get rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and his ... thugs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I would love to see them get him out.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused immediate comment on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement A broadcast of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interview on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces network was jammed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, was audible. Meanwhile, newly arrived American troops increased security at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and other installations under the roar of giant C-5A jets bringing in more men and supplies. Planes bringing in about 1,900 troops ordered by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> landed throughout the day at the rate of about one every 30 minutes at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION>, just outside the Panamanian capital. Medical supplies and ambulances were among the equipment arriving. The estimated 10,000 American troops already stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been ordered to avoid public areas except on official business following post-election violence. Not everybody heeded the advice. Early Saturday, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen arrived at the apartment of their Panamanian girlfriends intent on going to a disco. One, who has been in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> two years, said he does it every weekend. `` All that stuff you see on TV, I've never seen any of it,'' he said. In its news conference Saturday, the opposition was careful to say it would `` respect the integrity of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>,'' a suggestion that if the officer corps dumps <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, its positions would be guaranteed. In answer to a question, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said the opposition wanted three things from the OAS: condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and an appeal that he recognize the election results, diplomatic and political sanctions that would amount to a quarantine, and a mission of <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers to visit <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and deliver the resolutions to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a three-party coalition challenging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> had a 3-1 lead in election returns over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand-picked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. When the government nullified the vote, it claimed <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> was leading Endara 2-1. Tensions increased Wednesday when thugs beat up <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice presidential candidates. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> remained hospitalized Saturday, but his injuries were not considered life-threatening. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said the opposition has names of 157 opposition figures jailed since Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area and that the number may reach 300 nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the opposition leaders will not go into hiding. `` We will continue to lead, but not down the road that leads us to the slaughterhouse,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> cited missing ballots and alleged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interference in the campaign in justifying the nullification. In a full-page advertisement in Saturday's <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estrella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, the largest party in the opposition, claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, as a partner in the alleged vote fraud, lacks the moral authority to nullify the elections. The newspaper is the only one left in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> not screamingly anti-American and pro-Noriega, and it is the only one that prints opposition news or advertising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recalled its ambassador, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, for consultations after the vote was nullified. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is to leave for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also recalled their ambassadors and countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have called on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to honor the election results. In <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejera </PERSON> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> denied a report Saturday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> asylum. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has not appeared in public since before the election. He was indicted last year by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on drug charges. But he contends the charges are a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ploy to get rid of him in favor of someone who will help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> scrap the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. Those treaties turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday urged the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people and defense forces to drive Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` and his doberman thugs'' from power and pledged support for a successor government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped short of directly urging violence or a coup but told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION>, `` I would love'' to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` out of there right now.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in this country on drug charges, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't care whether the Panamanian leader went to a nation that has an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We know what countries are willing'' to take <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said there are no signs the leader is getting ready to step down. The president made his comments to reporters as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops continued flying into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on a mission of protection for Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in the wake of violence that followed last week's election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has accused the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime of stealing the election from the opposition candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. Asked by reporters if his words could be seen as a call to revolution or violent overthrow, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose not to temper the remarks. `` No, I would add no words of caution. The will of the people should be implemented,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hedged a hypothetical question about the American military responding to request for aid from the 15,000-strong Defense Forces, saying: `` They would n't need support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to get rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He's one man and they have a well trained force.'' The president's made his remarks as he flew from one college commencement address to another in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. His comments marked the latest in a series of steps designed to raise the stakes in a long-running <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort _ dating to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ to bring about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s downfall. Asked if he was calling for the Panamanian Defense Forces to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` We'd like to see him out of there, not just the PDF, the will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ...'' `` The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his doberman thugs,'' the president said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s riot police are referred to as `` dobermans. Asked if he cared where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> went, he said, `` I care that he does whatever it takes to get him out of there right now.'' He said going to a country that would bar extradition `` could well be the answer'' for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` That could be a solution ... He ought to think about that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president said he was anxious to make sure that the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did not harbor the misconception that the administration's drumbeat of anti-Noriega statements were directed also at them. `` If I were speaking to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, I would tell them that the affection by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is still very much intact, strong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters flying with him to a graduation address at <ORGANIZATION> Mississsippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` And secondly I would say to the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the PDF, they have a useful role to play and they will in the future of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The problem is not the PDF per se. The problem is <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again condemned what he called a fraudulent election last Sunday in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offcials and observers have said the anti-Noriega opposition won overwhelmingly but that the election was, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put it, `` blatantly stolen'' by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government said their candidate for president had won, based on partially counted returns. But then <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> invalidated the whole election in the face of an outcry over fraudulent balloting practices. `` The people should do everything they can to have the will of the people respected,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They ought to just do everything they can to get Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of there.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to say if he has talked to representatives of other countries about accepting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he steps down. He would say only, `` I'm confident they would receive him.'' He did not name any countries or say how he had received such assurances. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is continuing to talk to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, calling for international condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Beyond that he did not state any additional actions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might take beyond the sending of 2,000 troops this week to help protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We're still at the plate, and we'll stay at the plate until we can help the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have the democracy for which they spoke so articulately in an election. And we're not going to give up on them.'' `` No effort will be a success until he leaves,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned reporters aboard Air Force One and made the statement concerning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and then answered questions. He said that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is ousted, the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people will have `` an instant normalization of relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and there will be a useful role for the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said his administration would recognize the government of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> if he were sworn in as president. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and other observers said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won a 3-1 victory over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> last Sunday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said further he would return the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and lift economic sanctions that have been in place for more than a year. `` I think the election made so clear that the people want democracy and made so clear that that democracy is being thwarted by one man that that in itself could be the catalyst for removing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge has ruled that it's possible for blacks to discriminate against other blacks based on the color of their skin Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ruled that race and color are not the same thing. `` It would take an ethnocentric and naive world view to suggest that we can divide Caucasians into many subgroups, but somehow all blacks are part of the same subgroup,'' <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> said. `` There are sharp and distinctive contrasts amongst native black African peoples both in color and in physical characteristics.'' In his ruling Thursday, <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> certified for trial a lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION> Tracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, a clerk typist for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. She contended that her supervisor, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, `` singled her out for close scrutiny and reprimanded her for many things that were false or insubstantial.'' Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s skin was lighter than Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>'. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Moye </PERSON>'s ruling may be a first. `` If this issue had been raised, everyone here would have been aware of it,'' she said. `` It is unique.'' Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s suit said Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> considered her to be tardy, lazy and incompetent, and recommended that she be fired. Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who disputed Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' appraisal of her, eventually lost her job. The defendants in the case _ including Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary _ argued that people of the same race ca n't discriminate against each other because color has `` generally been interpreted to mean the same thing as race.'' <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> disagreed, citing a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that a white employer had discriminated against a naturalized American from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> because of his Arabian ancestry. He said `` there is evidence that Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> might have harbored resentful feelings towards white people, and therefore by inference, possibly towards light-skinned black people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Saturday. No trial date for the lawsuit has been set.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students protested tuition increases Saturday as incoming freshmen toured the campus, but there was no repeat of the violence that resulted in 71 arrests the day before. About 50 students demonstrated as six police officers on horseback and at least a dozen on foot kept watch. The protest focused on police treatment of demonstrators Friday as well as the 13 percent tuition hike for undergraduates and increases of up to 18 percent for graduate students approved the same day. Televisions were set up on the main green to show a homemade videotape of police slapping students with nightsticks and carrying others away by the hair when the students refused to leave the dean of students' office. `` <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> created a riot, and now they're trying to play it down,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick </PERSON>, a 20-year-old sophomore from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>. `` We were just trying to be heard. If we ca n't speak up, who's going to hear us?'' Associate Dean of Students <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> blamed the violence on the students, saying they broke the state university's regulations. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he saw someone jump a detective Friday. `` That's the only violence I saw,'' he said. <PERSON> Stu </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiser </PERSON>, a 22-year-old junior from <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> and a member of the student government, said the latest protest was aimed at the incoming freshmen touring the campus and their parents. `` Had some of these students known of the tuition increase, they may not have decided to come here,'' <PERSON> Heiser </PERSON> said. Under tuition increases approved Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> and going into effect this fall, undergraduate students who are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> residents will pay $ 2,576 a year and most graduate students will pay $ 3,668.

 Representatives of striking guards at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a contract with the facility's security contractor on Saturday in an attempt to end a two month-old walkout. `` It's a very good contract.

About 250 security inspectors went on strike March 13, protesting <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hanger-Silas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s disciplinary policies and other working conditions at the government complex where the atomic bomb was developed during World War II and where military research is still done. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hanger </ORGANIZATION>'s contract manager, said he was satisfied with the pact, which was completed about 4 a.m. after an 18-hour negotiating session. `` There's nothing in there that I ca n't live with,'' he said. Union officials declined to discuss specifics of the contract until it is ratified, but <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> said the proposal addressed most of the guards' major concerns, including overtime, discipline and sick leave. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> attorney who helped represent the union, said a back-to-work pact still must be negotiated, and talks on that would take place Monday and Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his first comments on Soviet arms reductions, said Saturday he welcomed the move and said he wanted to win the `` peace war'' with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The president, reacting to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announced cut of 500 short-range missiles in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, challenged the Soviet leader to make good on his promise to reduce the Soviet's nuclear arsenal. `` Let him do what he says, unilaterally. It would be good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said aboard Air Force One. His remarks indicated adherence to his opposition to negotiations with the Soviets for cuts in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tactical nuclear weapons in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We've already removed 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, and it would be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was referring to `` well over 2,000'' obsolete nuclear warheads that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has taken out of service in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over the past few years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented a day after he called for a new openness in U.S.-Soviet relations that would bring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` back into the world order,'' including a call for mutual surveillance flights over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact territories. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in Friday's speech to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, mixed optimism over recent political reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with an insistence that promises be met with deeds, a theme he repeated on Saturday in his chat with reporters. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement on the cuts on Soviet weapons on Thursday, made to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, caught <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials by surprise. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday, when asked if he thought he would win the public-relations war with his Soviet counterpart, declared: `` No such war. I want to win the peace war, lasting peace, that built on action not on words.'' `` Action is what I talked about yesterday,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think we will prevail,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to consider reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lance missiles in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons is erased has split <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Saturday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would consider a rearmament step or a break with the intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> upgrades its short-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> Saturday, and the talks focused on the contentious missile issue. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined immediate comment on <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not yet received any reaction from allies to his call for mutual surveillance flights, a revival of an Eisenhower-era `` open skies'' proposal. The president said he had talked by phone to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Saturday morning, when both of them were in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, to discuss briefly the secretary of state's trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. On other subjects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to discuss the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, brushing aside reports that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> might have offered political asylum to <LOCATION> Panamian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he would have something to say on the subject of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the next few days, although did not disclose the forum. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> suggested that the administration did not want to elaborate upon the tense situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at this time because `` the stated policy is to protect American lives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the week dispatched 2,000 U.s. troops to reinforce American bases and protect Americans living there. The president talked with reporters on Air Force One in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> before back-to-back commencement speeches in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ speeches that extolled virtues of education, family and work and did not touch upon current events. In a speech to predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Alcorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here at <LOCATION> Lorman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the `` economic transformation wrought by historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges such as <LOCATION> Alcorn </LOCATION> is nothing less than astounding.'' Noting that while 85-percent of graduates in such schools came from blue-collar families, `` almost all go on to professional or managerial positions.'' `` It's an exciting tradition, and one of the most under-appreciated success stories in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. Deputy press secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said that a member of a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> SWAT team assigned to provide security at <ORGANIZATION> Alcorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> accidentally fired his rifle. The episode occurred before the president's helicopter landed, and no one was hurt, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Later, in remarks prepared for commencement at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of the `` values of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s good, quiet, decent people _ Americans who know that we are not the sum of our possessions, but of how we conduct ourselves.'' `` These people form the heart of our society,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The postwar period has given way to a new world _ a world still perilous, but alive with prospects for peace and with certainty of change. Yet there are some things that have n't changed since 1948. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s values have n't.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quoted slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Alcorn </LOCATION> State speech: `` intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character _ that is the true goal of education.'' And in the speech to <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> evoked the memory of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> novelist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, who spent most of his life in the area `` Let <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>'s ` verities and truths of the heart' be our values,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to outline his administration's emerging foreign policy strategy in a series of five speeches. His <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M speech was the first, and he is also to dwell on East-West relations in a speech next weekend at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He was to travel to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, later Saturday to attend a fund-raising dinner for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first appearance at a political fund-raising event as president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to spend the night in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> at the home of a friend, then return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent Friday night in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, at the Houstonian Hotel, which had been his official voting residence as vice president. He jogged both Friday night and Saturday morning on the hotel grounds, and on Friday night took a group of friends to a local <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> barbecue and spare ribs restaurant, walking around the establishment shaking hands with patrons.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to dispose of the wastes from its oil spill cleanup won guarded state approval Saturday, but the oil company was told it should not expect exemptions from air-quality laws. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> aircraft patrolled sections of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in a hunt for spilled oil to keep <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s prized halibut catch free of floating crude. The first round of flights was canceled early Saturday because of bad weather. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> announced its general approval of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s disposal plan, allowing the company to process polluted water at the oil industry's jointly owned <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> ballast treatment plant in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. But the state, while also approving <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to burn solid oil-fouled wastes, said the company must use special incinerators in order to meet air quality standards. The state suggested that the wastes be burned in barges off the coast. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said one barge would be sufficient; the state, however, said two. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, which has spent about $ 100 million on the cleanup to date, expects to pick up about 55,000 tons of waste by Sept. 15, the completion target date. The waste includes oily water skimmed up by vessels, tar-covered sea debris, oil-soaked absorbent pads and wipes, damaged clothing and dead animals. The company has proposed cleaning 364 miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coastline by September, and burning, burying or discharging in water the oily wastes it accumulates. With the opening of the halibut season only two days away, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ordered pilots to locate oil blotches in the spill zone, then use the information to produce maps that will be distributed to fishermen. `` We got a couple of flights out despite the weather, and fishermen are telling us conditions are pretty good,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>. `` Weather in several areas around the sound is clearing up and the water is getting smoother.'' Vice Adm. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, the ranking federal official in the spill zone, scheduled eight flights each day on Saturday and Sunday over hundreds of square miles, crisscrossing the zone where the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground on March 24, leaking nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. In other developments: _ Authorities said two beached whales were discovered on <LOCATION> Tugidak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 450 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridgman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, said authorities had not determined whether the whales' deaths were related to the oil spill. _ Oil washed ashore at the fishing village of Homer on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, about 200 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> Local residents said small tar balls and globs of tacky crude washed up on the beach. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> workers and volunteers from Homer cleaned up the crude, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. _ Gov <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> announced plans to tour the lower 48 states to persuade tourists that <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s spectacular scenery is not awash in oil. He plans news conferences in six cities; advertisements touting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will run in 14 major markets, financed by $ 4 million from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were planning joint tests of powerful chemicals to break down thick crude that has washed up on beaches in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and elsewhere The tests are scheduled for the middle of the week on <LOCATION> Ingot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a small island fouled by the spill. The chemicals thin out the crude, then allow it to be washed away into the water where it can be collected by skimmer boats or decompose.

 Officials planned special anti-drug lectures for kindergarteners after three 5-year-olds were found playing with a bag of cocaine at school.

The envelope was opened, some spilled on the desk, some on the floor,'' <PERSON> Lubkin </PERSON> said. `` Out of the innocence of tots, the two friends, possibly emulating adults, started to put it near their noses,'' <PERSON> Lubkin </PERSON> said. `` They had powder on their faces _ whether they sniffed it or not we do n't know.'' Tests at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> indicated the three children did not have any drugs in their systems. <PERSON> Lubkin </PERSON> said the youngster who took the white powder to school said she found it in her home `` but the stories changed several times.''

No charges have been filed against her parents, police said. The other two girls were released to the their parents, <PERSON> Lubkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lubkin </PERSON> said a drug counselor was ordered to go to the 1,250-pupil school and speak to the pre-schoolers about drug abuse and `` to re-emphasize anti-drug lessons.'' Across the street from the school, narcotics officers have repeatedly raided an apartment building where crack and other drugs are dealt openly.

 Ministers from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc voted Saturday to support Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan for the occupied territories, virtually assuring <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> approval, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman said. Also Saturday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> met with leaders of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the election proposal that would give Palestinians limited autonomy. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Israeli troops shot and wounded 19 Palestinians in scattered clashes, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a 60-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was stabbed and critically wounded by masked assailants who apparently suspected him of collaborating with Israeli authorities. The 26-member government meets Sunday in a regular session to consider <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan. At least 17 ministers from the 26-member government have indicated support for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan. `` We expect it to pass,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Achimier </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. At Saturday's meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, the vote was 6-2 in favor of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan. Party officials said three <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers are out of the country but two are expected to vote for it by proxy. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> vote Saturday night was not binding, but gave an indication of the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan's support. The only resistance has come from hardline <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> elements. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ministers voted 9-2 last week _ also in a non-biding vote _ to support the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, now trade minister, has opposed the plan, saying it would undermine Israeli security. The four-page plan submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers avoided disputed issues, according to one party official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Controversial issues were not mentioned in the proposal,'' the official said. `` It's only a first proposal.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> official at the meeting said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> emphasized the necessity of adopting the plan, saying it would ease international pressure on the party. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, an aide to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, met with Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> Saturday and briefed him on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s talks last week with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who arrived Saturday also will confer with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and other government leaders. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> discussed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan at their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, said after meeting <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy told him the Soviets view <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan with `` an air of development and optimism.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> broke off diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured lands from Soviet-allied <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hopes <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan will help end the 17-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, in which at least 472 Arabs and 21 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and his delegation are seeking further details on the peace plan. Informed sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Americans want to know if the 140,000 Arabs living in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> will be allowed to vote and also if there would be international supervision of the balloting in the occupied territories. A <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> official said those two issues were not dealt with in the proposal submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers Saturday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 war and later annexed it.

She was taken to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she was in good condition. Cross was released at 12:55 p.m., and walked to a waiting ambulance. Her former boyfriend, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, propped himself against a kitchen wall and held <ORGANIZATION> SWAT </ORGANIZATION> team members at bay, pointing a gun to his head or chest and threatening suicide. At 6:23 p.m., he surrendered to police, <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a 25-year-old kitchen worker in a hotel on the Strip, fired shots at other workers and security guards at the casino, but there were no other serious injuries, <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON> said. More than 40 police officers including a SWAT team and a crowd in the hundreds surrounded the 12-story, downtown hotel after the incident began at 7:55 a.m. Witnesses said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a worker at a Strip hotel, grabbed Cross in the hotel coffee shop, then forced her into the kitchen. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullitt </PERSON>, a chef, said he stumbled on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and Cross in the kitchen. `` I heard this ` girl' whimpering, pleading,'' <PERSON> Bullitt </PERSON> said. He said he ran to break up the fight, but saw the man had a .357 - caliber Magnum `` I stopped and looked at the guy, and he looked at me,'' <PERSON> Bullitt </PERSON> said. `` He fired at me at point-blank range.'' <PERSON> Bullitt </PERSON> said the shot went over his shoulder, shattering glass behind him which cut another worker, and <PERSON> Bullitt </PERSON> managed to flee. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> fired shots at the first security guards to arrive, <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON> said. One guard returned fire, but missed. The hostage's sister, <PERSON> Roma </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had threatened Cross at least four times. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said her sister obtained a restraining order against <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> late last year, but he continued to harass her at her job and home. `` He said if he could n't have her he did n't want anyone else to have her and he did n't want to live,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` She was always afraid he'd shoot her.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leaders Urge Workers to Avoid Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity leaders urged members of the independent union Saturday to resist pressures to strike, and accused the country's official unions of fomenting work stoppages. Solidarity, which has used strikes in the past to advance its demands, has taken the new tack since reaching an agreement with the government in April to take part in the political process as a legal organization. Its leader, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, stopped short of telling copper miners to end a six-day strike last week. However, he said the country faced more pressing problems than pay demands and that economic stability is needed for reforms to take root. Solidarity's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> articulated the union's current position on strikes Saturday, saying, `` The use of strike pressure for this purpose -LRB- higher pay -RRB- only makes the situation worse. It creates political tensions, leads to increasing inflation, depreciates the currency.'' It said union members should instead concentrate on making Solidarity stronger. `` Organizing our union is now the most important task of all structures and activists of Solidairty,'' it said. `` Only as a strong and well-organized union will Solidarity be able to effectively influence reforms.'' The declaration was made at a commission meeting chaired by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Hundreds of strikes over pay have occurred this year. Most of the work stoppages have been isolated and have ended quickly. But the 15,000 copper miners idled four mines for six days until management agreed last Thursday to grant pay increases of 30 percent and a 30 percent bonus. The Solidarity leadership also charged the official trade union alliance, known as OPZZ, of trying to provoke strikes. `` In many regions and branches, our union is provoked to strike and a special role is played here by <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> activists, who try to make impossible the agreements of the roundtable,'' it said. The `` roundtable'' is a reference to the broad-based talks leading to the pact between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition on April 5.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday called on the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power and said, `` I would love to see them get him out.'' But even as he showed a clenched fist to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extended a welcome to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announced plans to eliminate 500 short-range missiles from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Let him do what he says unilaterally. It would be good,'' the president said. Articulating foreign policy literally on the fly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One in two separate sessions as he made his way from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to a pair of college commencement speeches in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. He was flying to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> for the night. When a reporter suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s words about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be interpreted as a call to revolution or violent overthrow, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not temper the remarks. `` No, I would add no words of caution,'' he said. `` The will of the people should be implemented.'' `` No effort will be successful until he leaves,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the Panamanian leader, whom he again accused of stealing last weekend's election. As for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered no reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in reply, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has already removed warheads from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Asked if he thought he would win a public-relations war with his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared: `` No such war. I want to win the peace war, lasting peace, that built on action not on words.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his strongest words to date in addressing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and he did so as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops continued flowing into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and property there. The president went before television cameras to promise full support for a successor to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people force him from power. While stopping short of urging violence or a coup, the president declared he would `` love'' to see the Panamanians get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out and pointedly declined to soften his language. Was he calling for a military coup? `` We'd like to see him out of there, not just the PDF, the will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` ... The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his doberman thugs.'' The Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> instigated the contact with reporters on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issue, making brief remarks, on camera, before submitting to a few questions. Only a few hours earlier _ this time only in response to questions _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he had no desire to engage in a public relations war with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but wanted to win the `` peace war.'' In his first comments on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announced cut of 500 short-range missiles in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the president told reporters he welcomed the move. `` Let him do what he says, unilaterally. It would be good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. His remarks indicated adherence to his opposition to negotiations with the Soviets for cuts in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tactical nuclear weapons in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We've already removed 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, and it would be nice to have him go ahead and make some moves,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was referring to `` well over 2,000'' obsolete nuclear warheads that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has taken out of service in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over the past few years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented a day after he called for a new openness in U.S.-Soviet relations that would bring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` back into the world order,'' including a call for mutual surveillance flights over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact territories. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in Friday's speech to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, mixed optimism over recent political reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with an insistence that promises be met with deeds, a theme he repeated on Saturday in his chat with reporters. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement on the cuts on Soviet weapons on Thursday, made to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, caught <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials by surprise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to consider reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lance missiles in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons is erased has split <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday, `` We'll work it out. This alliance is strong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not yet received any reaction from allies to his call for mutual surveillance flights, a revival of an Eisenhower-era `` open skies'' proposal. The president said he had talked by phone to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Saturday morning, when both of them were in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, to discuss briefly the secretary of state's trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The president talked first with reporters on Air Force One in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> before back-to-back commencement speeches in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ speeches that extolled virtues of education, family and work and did not touch upon current events. He brought up the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> matter en route from predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Alcorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lorman </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Starkville </LOCATION>. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issue again at a fundraising dinner in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, for the 1990 re-election effort of Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky. `` Let me just assure you of this: I will act prudently in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` We do not want to return to the days of the imperial gringos of the North. But let everybody be clear on one point, I will protect the lives of Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ whether they're military or civilians.'' `` We will not let <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives be put at risk by a dictator down there,'' he declared. At <ORGANIZATION> Alcorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, he said the `` economic transformation wrought by historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges such as <LOCATION> Alcorn </LOCATION> is nothing less than astounding.'' Noting that while 85 percent of graduates in such schools came from blue-collar families, `` almost all go on to professional or managerial positions.'' `` It's an exciting tradition, and one of the most under-appreciated success stories in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. Departing from his prepared remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience at <LOCATION> Alcorn </LOCATION> that `` as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> moves toward greater openness and democratization, and as they meet the challenge of responsible behavior, we will match their steps with steps of our own.'' He said over the past four decades, `` the Soviets have chosen to stand apart from and opposed to, the world family of nations.'' `` Yesterday, I announced a new policy for the 1990s, one that moves beyond just trying to contain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ... And if we succeed, I can guarantee to you and your kids _ that the future you know is going to be safer, and the world you know will be freer.''

 <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, in his first television interview in five years, says he has matured into his role as the future king of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and finds that he is taken more seriously than in the past.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Saturday said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> might rearm or break the intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> upgrades its short-range missiles. The veiled threat to match a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal to increase the range of European-based Lance nuclear missiles was the latest Soviet effort to pressure the West into a new round of arms talks. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> for four hours Saturday. The talks focused on the contentious missile issue, which has divided <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> approval this month of a plan to `` modernize,'' or more than triple the range of the Lance rockets by 1995. But <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has balked and is pressing for superpower talks on reducing short-range weapons. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range missiles are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and public opinion here is strongly against the modernization step for fear it would jeopardize arms control efforts. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the modernization project was tantamount to `` development of a new weapons system,'' and he said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would not want to have to take a similar step. `` This would have to be considered, but it would not be by our own choice,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> warned at a news conference before returning to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He likened the new missiles <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to develop to the Soviet SS-23s being dismantled under the December 1987 superpower accord eliminating medium-range missiles. `` Why should we liquidate the SS-23 if the other side is creating and will deploy an analogous Lance-2 rocket?'' the foreign minister said. `` It makes no sense to destroy these rockets then.'' He said destruction of the SS-23 would have to be halted `` or we would have to create a new system.'' Suspension of the SS-23 liquidation would violate the INF treaty. Asked about the possibility of the Soviets rearming, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Saturday, `` They've already rearmed. That's easy for them to say.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to replace the Lance missiles, which have a range of less than 75 miles, with missiles capable of reaching up to 300 miles. That would keep them within the limits allowed under the 1987 accord. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has repeatedly said it wants a balance of conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before entering into talks aimed at elimination of short-range missiles. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are already embarked on efforts to get rid of long-range and medium-range missiles, and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials argue that a short-range nuclear option is necessary to defend against an attack by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s superior conventional forces. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced last week during Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> would unilaterally cut its short-range strength by 500 warheads, and he called again for negotiations on the remaining nuclear arms. The move has been met with only a lukewarm response by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> deemed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> gesture `` a good step, but a small step.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday said, `` Let him do what he says unilaterally. It would be good.'' `` We've already removed 2,000 nuclear weapons, and it would be nice to have him -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- go ahead and make some moves,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft accused <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of a publicity ploy aimed at splitting the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about Scowcroft's view, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said it would be `` naive'' of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to try to disrupt the Western alliance, and he said the Soviet measure was aimed at balancing East-West defenses. The Western alliance estimates that the short-range forces of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations outnumber <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s by 12-to-1. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> admitted there is an East bloc `` superiority'' in some weapons but said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has `` renounced'' that advantage and taken steps to eliminate it. In his talks with <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the Soviet diplomat repeatedly pressed for superpower talks to reduce the short-range forces and berated <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for its refusal. `` What is to be feared by talking?'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said during his news conference. `` No one can be forced in negotiations to do what he does not want to do.'' But when asked if he was frustrated by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's dismissal of the latest <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> offers, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> responded: `` We have strong nerves We will wait ... We believe that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will find in the nearest time a new approach on this.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s two-day visit was dominated by the superpower and internal <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> disarmament dispute. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s resistance on the missile modernization plan has drawn some support from other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members, creating a rift within the 16-nation Western alliance. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who has long advocated a more trusting relationship between the superpowers in the wake of Soviet democratic reforms and disarmament progress, is the driving force behind <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s stand on modernization. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> sidestepped a question about <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s threat of a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> rearmament move, declaring it `` improper to address speculative considerations.''

 More than 220 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested here Saturday morning as throngs of protesters from both sides of the issue converged to draw attention to their views on Mother's Day weekend. Nearly 200 other anti-abortion protesters were arrested in demonstrations in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, more than 5,000 people held a rally at the state Capitol to demand that abortion remain legal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to denounce protests against clinics that perform abortions. Demonstrators carried signs with slogans such as `` Mother's Day Not Mandatory.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police arrested 143 men and 80 women at the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and charged them with resisting arrest and mob action, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicini </PERSON>. The street was closed to traffic. Police broke up occasional sidewalk skirmishes between the demonstrators and abortion rights protesters. Other anti-abortion demonstrators were stationed at more than 25 clinics throughout the city, organizers said. Park Medical Center continued seeing patients, and abortion rights activists vowed to stay until the clinic had treated the last of 21 patients. The clinic performs a range of gynecological services besides abortions. Police earlier estimated more than 300 people had been arrested. The confusion arose because the arrests so overtaxed the local police district that protesters had to be sent to four other stations to be processed, Ms. <PERSON> Vicini </PERSON> said. Detainees further clogged the system by giving their names only as `` Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' and `` Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>,'' police said. Most carried no identification. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, about 100 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested Saturday outside a clinic in <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 10 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, police said. Also arrested were five to 10 abortion rights demonstrators involved in a brief scuffle with the activists representing <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-abortion group, said Police Chief <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardino </PERSON>. All were arrested for investigation of blocking a public sidewalk, an infraction, and were cited and released, <PERSON> Guardino </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, 84 demonstrators were arrested for refusing to leave a women's clinic that performs abortions, and three of the protesters were charged with assaulting police officers, said Officer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Melick </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, which organized that demonstration as well, charged that police repeatedly kicked one protest leader, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> was listed in fair condition at <LOCATION> Mercy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was being treated for abdominal injuries, according to nursing supervisor <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKendry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> said as many as four officers kicked him after he complained police were kicking demonstrators as they put them in a paddy wagon and threw them on top of each other. `` I was pleading with them, saying, ` Please do n't do that,' `` he said in an interview from the hospital. However, Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubrecht </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> was one of several protesters who crawled under wooden police barracades to block doors to the clinic. `` He grabbed a police officer by the leg and he would n't let go,'' <PERSON> Aubrecht </PERSON> said. `` And she -LRB- the police officer -RRB- yelled, ` Let go of my leg! Let go of my leg! `` `` We are saying he -LRB- <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> -RRB- was not kicked,'' <PERSON> Aubrecht </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON> will be charged with two separate assault charges.

 Hundreds of rival fans clashed at an English soccer game on Saturday, and 16 people were hospitalized with injuries, including a stabbing victim, police said. Authorities arrested 25 people. They later released one and filed charges against the rest ranging from disorderly behavior and drunkenness to assault and drug possession, police said. The incident came after 95 fans died during an April 15 stampede at a soccer game at Hillsborough Stadium in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The game Saturday was between <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> and host <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Selhurst </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Rival fans fought on the field early in the game, and others vandalized parked buses near the stadium, authorities said. At least 16 people were hospitalized, including one fan who was stabbed, but authorities said none of the injuries appeared serious. <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> fans climbed over a low fence and rushed onto the field about 12 minutes into the game as <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> went ahead 1-0. They were confronted by <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> supporters, and fights broke out, officials said. The English Soccer League game was stopped immediately. Referee <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodenham </PERSON> ordered the players off the field as seven mounted police arrived to restore order. Ambulances were summoned to carry away injured fans. The game resumed 27 minutes later and ended in a 4-1 Crystal Palace victory. `` The majority of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> fans came down to have a good time, some of them in fancy dress,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, chief superintendent for stadium security. `` Unfortunately, there is always a minority who spoil things.'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said several hundred fans were on the field at one point, and she admitted that police did not expect so many <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> supporters at the game.

<HEAD>Reports Pope John Paul I Died After He Stopped Taking Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new book on Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>'s death after a 33-day reign suggests he was so burdened by the task he stopped taking vital medicines, according to a report in The Sunday Times. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper is publishing edited extracts of the book, `` A Thief in the Night'' by journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON>. The author disputes theories that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> I might have been killed by people in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> involved in intrigues and power struggles between conservatives and liberals in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy.. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> was elected pope on Aug. 26, 1978, and was found dead in the bed of his Vatican apartment the morning of Sept. 29 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said the pontiff, nearly 66 years old, died of a heart attack. No autopsy was performed. Theories of a conspiracy against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> were fueled later by a scandal involving the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, headed by American Archbishop <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON>, and its links to the 1982 collapse of the huge Italian bank <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvi </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>, was found hanged under <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Blackfriars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> police investigated the scandal. In 1984, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Yallop </PERSON> claimed in his book `` In God's Name'' that the pontiff was poisoned because he intended to crack down on corruption in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. He mentioned <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON> as a conspirator. <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> writes in his book, `` The truth is much more shameful even than if the pope had been murdered. That would have been the work of several criminals or madmen, where in fact the whole of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is responsible for the death of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>.'' `` Tormented by the conviction that he was unfit for the papal throne _ a feeling shared by many in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> was allowed to go to the solitary death he had prayed for, untended and uncared for by those closest to him,'' according to the newspaper excerpts. It said <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> found the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> had been taking medication for a blood-clotting condition that he recognized as a `` matter of life and death.'' `` There is evidence that, not through forgetfulness, he deliberately stopped taking this medication because he could no longer continue as <PERSON> pope </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> wrote. He said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> encouraged his investigation, hoping it would disprove the conspiracy theories. No one was available for comment Saturday night at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> press office and the telephone at the home of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was not answered. The first segment of the excerpts dealt mainly with an interview <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said he had with <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON> at his office in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. According to the excerpts, <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON> about previous suggestions that the Chicago-born archbishop had conspired against the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and became involved with <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON> is quoted as saying, `` Both of these things are completely unfounded ... These guys are off their rockers.'' He also was quoted as saying he had one audience with the new pope who `` could n't have been nicer'' and asked <PERSON> Marcinkus </PERSON> to remain with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.

 Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> residents cleared their basements, turned off their electricity and bid their homes goodbye Saturday as the <LOCATION> Androscoggin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> inched onto the sidewalks of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s twin cities. By 10 p.m., the river was nearly 5 feet above flood level at <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, and civil emergency staffers were watching anxiously. `` I'm just not comfortable,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Androscoggin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've seen it quiet for hours and then suddenly take a jump of 2 or 3 feet.'' Early in the weekend, state and county emergency response officials advised residents to be ready to move quickly if the river should suddenly rise. Although no sweeping evacuations were made, families living closest to the river moved out as water filled their basements and forced the shutdown of household utilities. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> predicted the river in that area to crest `` just this side of 20 feet'' late Saturday. The flood threshold ranges from 18 feet to 13 feet at <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. `` The difference in types of damage between 18 and 20 feet is incredible,'' said <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>. `` We do n't want anyone to think it's over yet and go back home. A flood watch is expected to remain in effect for the rest of the weekend for all but the most northerly section of the state, even though little rain is expected, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The watch applies to the Presumpscot, <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Saco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Androcoggin </PERSON> as well as smaller rivers in the central and southwestern parts of the state. The <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> was also expected to crest at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sidney </LOCATION> by early evening Saturday at three feet above flood level, while in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> the river was expected to crest at 1 foot below flood level, the weather service said. The Saco crested early Saturday, but like most of the rivers will take a few days to recede, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Friday's storm closed dozens of roads and kept students out of school, but there were no serious accidents or fatalities reported. The rain-swollen <PERSON> Presumpscott </PERSON> had been the quickest to rise, overflowing its banks in <LOCATION> Westbrook </LOCATION> and forcing a paper mill to close Friday.

<HEAD>Two Formal Bids For Eastern Airlines Pending In Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group headed by a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader on Saturday submitted a proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in a bid that would temporarily put former Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in charge of the airline. The bid by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> was the second submitted to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge for the airline, which has been flying limited schedules since its <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> employees began a strike March 4. Details of the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> bid were unavailable, but the commodities trader said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that his offer would give <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions a larger stake in the airline than offered by a group headed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, the former commissioner of professional baseball. The <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> group had offered the unions 30 percent equity in the airline in exchange for $ 210 million in concessions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> had extended a Wednesday bidding deadline to 11 a.m. Saturday to allow the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> group to study confidential financial data in making its bid. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a machinists union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that virtually grounded the airline. The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern or any of its businesses. Eastern, however, insists the airline is not for sale and is proceeding with a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise $ 1.8 billion by selling aircraft and other assets. In addition to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, who is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, is being assisted by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, an investor group led by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, submitted its bid before the prior 5 p.m. Wednesday deadline. The investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is a participant in the Howard group. Billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> already has proposed buying all of Eastern for around $ 500 million, although it is unclear whether he has submitted a formal offer. Before submitting formal bids, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and their associates had extensive talks with representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and creditors Sources have told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that both proposals address the issue of a temporary trustee who would operate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in a way that should prevent the issue from sabotaging a potential deal between a buyer and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. They declined to specify. The issue of a trustee who would assume control of the airline from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was at the heart of the collapse of <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s $ 464 million deal to buy Eastern. The bankruptcy judge has scheduled a Monday meeting on developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s deal with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service for $ 365 million.

<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shouting and clapping, about 150 relatives and supporters of laid-off police, firefighters and rescue workers in this city marched to the mayor's house Saturday to demand his recall. Some marchers pushed babies in strollers or walked dogs dressed in union T-shirts. Most demonstrators wore black T-shirts reading, `` R.I.P. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. She was a Proud Lady. Shot in the Back by Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>.'' `` This is to show him how many people this is affecting,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Munnings </PERSON>, who helped organize the protest at <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s house and whose husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, is to be laid off May 31. She said the layoffs in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> city near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were `` affecting children and families and the officers who remain who wo n't have their backups. That's what we're trying to show him today. No husbands allowed.'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> did not appear to be home. Saturday's protest was made possible when <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beglin </PERSON> on Friday refused to extend a restraining order prohibiting protests at <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s home. The order was issued last month after a crowd of police officers, firefighters and ambulance workers vandalized <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s house during a protest. On April 14, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> laid off 67 police officers, 53 firefighters, and 24 emergency medical technicians, citing a budget shortfall brought on by cuts in state aid and rising garbage disposal costs. Thirty-four more police officers and another 29 firefighting jobs are to be cut May 31, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Partanza </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION>. The police and the others contend <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s action has severely compromised the city's ability to control crime and handle emergencies. After the first wave of layoffs last month, laid-off workers and supporters started a campaign to recall <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>.

 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he failed to report a $ 50,000 loan used to finance a personal investment on his financial disclosure form, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> as saying the failure was the result of an oversight by his accountant, who the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip said also inaccurately reported several aspects of the transaction. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told the paper he is amending his financial disclosure form to reflect the loan. The paper said he acknowledged he knew about the loan but did not disclose it publicly when questions were raised in April about his $ 100,000 investment in a junk bond. His campaign committee was initially listed as the buyer of the bond from the brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said it actually was a personal investment and the brokerage firm erred in saying the bonds were bought by his campaign fund.

<TEXT>
 A vanguard of 2,000 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops reached <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Friday with the arrival of the first 150 Marines dispatched by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and American interests. A C-141 cargo plane carrying 10 Marines, a cannon-equipped armored Scout car and 90 crates of ammunition arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> at 1:50 p.m. EDT after a nearly five-hour flight from the <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Marine Air Station. At least three other C-141s and three huge C-5 cargo planes stuffed with 17 more armored vehicles, support trucks and Marines were close behind. Col. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The troops are needed, as the president stated yesterday, because we feel it's a prudent decision to increase the security for our installations and our personnel. Gen. -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s heavy-handed tactics and his willingness to abuse human rights prove there's a lack of control on the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We feel like although no Americans have been directly threatened, we felt like it's only prudent to move our people out and increase security.'' He said the Marines and additional Army troops will be used to provide security at the 10 bases and one radar site in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> would guard the perimeter of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, which is about five miles east of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and an ammunition dump as well as assist with security at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. He declined to say whether the vehicles would patrol the perimeters but said, `` You can assume the perimeters of our bases will be protected.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Humble </PERSON>, commander of the Second Light Armored Infantry Battalion, told reporters on the flight to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>: `` I think we're going to be here until this is resolved.'' `` With what's going on down there any prudent American would be concerned ...'' said <PERSON> Humble </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, Ky. He said the troops were bringing along `` enough so that if we get into something,'' there is sufficient firepower. The Marine troops, who tried to catnap under ponchos on the long flight to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, will be joined by more <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> combat troops from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, shortly _ all directed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, property and interests in the tense nation. Humble, in response to questions, said that if necessary the armored vehicles could be used to bring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens safely back to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and said his force is trained for such missions. `` That's an evacuation operation and that is a routine thing we train for,'' he said. But Col. <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said there was no plan for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> vehicles to go off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases.

<HEAD>Stocks Post Big Gain on Encouraging Inflation Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices posted their biggest gain in nearly a year Friday, finishing at new post-crash highs following a government wholesale price report which analysts said eased Wall Street's fears about inflation. The market's best-known indicator, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, surged 56.82 points to settle at a new post-crash high of 2,439.70. Broader market indicators also rose in active trading, with more than three issues gaining for every one that fell among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Dow's previous high since its Oct. 19, 1987 crash was 2,418.99 set on April 27. The daily gain was the biggest since a 74.68-point jump on May 31, 1988. Analysts attributed Friday's gain to a smaller-than-expected rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s producer price index for April. The index rose 0.4 percent in April, or about half as much as many analysts had expected. The news sent long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices _ which move inversely to interest rates _ soaring by $ 20 and more for every $ 1,000 in face value. Investors apparently concluded the report meant inflationary pressures were not building and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might not continue its recent policy of encouraging higher interest rates, analysts said. `` The fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> from making moves to ease credit,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Now it looks like that has changed.''

 About 200 black students who say <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is n't adequately addressing racial problems maintained a sit-in for a fourth day Friday, blocking the main entrance to the administration building. Although side and back doors to the building were open, university spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Denbow </PERSON> said administration officials would n't negotiate with the students until the front door was opened. Protest leader <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> countered that the students would n't open the doors until negotiations had resumed. No formal negotiations were held Friday, <PERSON> Denbow </PERSON> said, adding that negotiations were scheduled for Saturday morning. `` I hope this is all over after Saturday's session,'' he said. One student who tried to get inside to join the protest was arrested Thursday night on a charge of causing a public disturbance. During the standoff, the cashier's and registrar's offices remained locked, prompting a backlash from some students who said they were being discriminated against because they could n't get inside. `` I really do think they are right to protest, but I do n't feel they have the right to occupy the administration building,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohensee </PERSON>, a 22-year-old senior, who said he spoke for a group called No Equality Through Inequality. `` I believe in what they're protesting, I just do n't like how they're going about it,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranes </PERSON>, a junior. `` That building does n't belong to them. It belongs to everyone on campus. I think they're alienating a lot of people.'' The protesters are asking for more black faculty, more recruitment of black students, creation of a minority adviser to the provost and the hiring of more minority group members, especially at upper levels. Their demands also include better treatment from <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> officers and the firing of any university employee found guilty of racism. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State has 42,695 students, and 2,703 of them, or 6.3 percent, are black, spokeswoman <PERSON> Cherryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on Friday to accept with `` prudence and responsibility'' the winner of elections, and the opposition Peronistas confidently predicted victory. The nation's 20 million eligible voters cast ballots this Sunday for president, vice president, one-half the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, one national senator, 15 provincial or territorial legislatures and thousands of local officials. `` Whatever is the result of the balloting, I ask people -LRB- to conduct themselves -RRB- so that prudence and responsibility are with us still,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> begged the sometimes volatile electorate in his 19-minute broadcast speech. `` I ask people -LRB- to behave -RRB- so no pretext can be used to alter the mechanisms that the Constitution provides for the election of representatives and the transfer of power.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has led in virtually every poll for months. The latest surveys give him a seven to 10 point edge over <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Voting actually is for 600 presidential electors. The winner needs at least 301. Sen. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the candidate's brother and key adviser, said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> polls and party projections `` are giving us more than 320 electors.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s campaign coordinator, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohan </PERSON>, said, `` I am absolutely sure we will win in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafiero </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, predicted that <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> `` absolutely'' will carry the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. Campaigns that began in earnest four months ago officially ended at 8 a.m. Friday, 48 hours before polls are scheduled to open. Hundreds of thousands attended rallies held by all three main parties on Thursday night. In central <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, where he is governor, <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> pledged before an estimated 300,000 supporters to `` unleash a battle with no quarter'' against inflation, to promote women's rights and to uphold civil liberties `` Never again will a Montonero or a green Falcon take away anyone's son because he thinks differently,'' he said. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s repressive security forces drove green <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> cars during the 1976-83 military regime's crackdown on leftist subversion. The Montonero urban guerrillas were linked with the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, 57, his own campaign hurt by <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, repeatedly sought to damage <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> by bringing up the violence and chaos of the 1973-76 Peronist government, which was overthrown by a coup. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has bitterly denounced the tactic. `` <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> says if <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> wins, democracy will lose,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 58, told about 100,000 supporters in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. `` They -LRB- the Radicals -RRB- demonstrated themselves to be democrats when in power and coupmongers'' when not. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, three times governor of rural <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, arrived at the plaza rally site outside <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> atop a bus that led a noisy motorcade through the capital's streets. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> coalition addressed a much smaller, less emotional crowd of about 30,000 in the capital, where his party has its most support. `` The country ca n't last through a new Radical or Peronist government,'' said <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON>, a 75-year-old engineer and former economy minister. He says his priorities would be to balance the budget, sell off state companies and encourage foreign investment. <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> was projected to get about 10 percent of the vote _ enough to play a pivotal role in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. If neither <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> wins outright, <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> could negotiate to give his electors to one of them. The main issue in 1983 elections was a return to democracy following a brutal military dictatorship. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who was elected president, can not seek re-election under the constitution. His term ends on Dec. 10. The main issue this year is the economy. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is suffering triple-digit inflation, a devalued currency, high unemployment, and a 59 billion foreign debt.

 Teachers in the nation's second-largest school district, seeking more money and more control of the curriculum, are threatening a strike Monday that could create chaos for 594,000 students weeks before school's end. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, said its members would keep at home with them the attendance and grade records that School Superintendent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> demanded be handed in by Monday.

<HEAD>From Alar to Aflatoxin, Environmental Problems Affecting Business
Behavior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From Alar apple ripener to animal feed-corn toxin to the molasses-like oil sludge polluting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s shore, environmental hazards have been catalysts forcing industries to reappraise the way they do business. The cost of these risks was clear this past week, when apple processors changed policy and urged a ban on Alar; the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> petroleum company capitulated to demands for more effective oil spill prevention; and hog farmers expressed alarm about a mysterious piglet die-off that some studies have linked to drought-parched corn tainted with aflatoxin, a fungus-produced poison. These developments were coincidental. But they all reflected the increased sensitivity that businesses have been forced to acquire in order to thrive in an economy where consumers are focusing more on their health and surroundings. The pressure on companies to quickly respond when questions are raised about their products or behavior is particularly acute among vendors of food and other consumer items, as events earlier this year demonstrated. When federal investigators found traces of cyanide in two imported Chilean grapes in March and temporarily ordered all Chilean fruit off the shelves, grocers nationwide took extraordinary steps to assure shoppers their produce was safe. Wholesalers and retailers absorbed $ 41 million in losses from dumped Chilean fruit. When a woman in <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. reported that her mouth was burned after gargling with Listerine antiseptic last month, manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rushed the suspect bottle through laboratory analysis and found nothing wrong. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> the nation's No. 3 retailer where the bottle was purchased, temporarily ordered all Listerine off the shelves in its 26-state chain. `` We stand by our decision and feel it was the thing to do,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON> said at the time. `` Our customers would more than agree with that.'' It was pressure from customers that provoked apple processors into an about-face on Alar, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing name for an organic acid that keeps apples on the tree until ripe and prolongs their crispness in storage. The processors urged the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to dissuade growers from using the substance, basing their position on what they called public hysteria about Alar and its effect on their business. Reports by some consumer groups that Alar poses a health risk to children have sent sales tumbling this year and devastated the earnings of apple orchards. Industry figures reported Friday suggested losses in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, which produces most of the nation's apples, will exceed $ 90 million. An even more dramatic policy change was announced by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the oil giant responsible for the oil spill March 24 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s once-pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The company has faced blistering criticism not only from environmentalists, but customers, federal regulators and large shareholders. A week before the company's annual meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives said this past Thursday they would support the appointment of an environmentalist to the board of directors and consider spending more money on pollution prevention. In other business and economic developments this past week: _ Government reports that suggested a slowing economy rallied the stock and bond markets, on the theory that inflation is no longer a big threat Wholesale prices and retail sales both rose only 0.4 percent in April, significantly lower than many economists anticipated. _ Two significant personalities in the financial world announced their resignations <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement director who led an unprecedented crackdown on Wall Street corruption, said he would step down in August. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who presided over the market's expansion into innovative securities to compete with bigger rivals, said he would leave when a successor is named. _ The targets of potentially hostile takeovers grew to include the <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> lady and the <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts man Direct selling marketer <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 2 billion takeover attempt of its much larger competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A Canadian investment concern, <ORGANIZATION> Kingsbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said it wanted to buy <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for at least $ 300 million Another target, <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has begun talks with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which has offered to buy the American advertising company for about $ 800 million but indicated it may increase its bid.

<HEAD>Negative Numbers, Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The outlook for business conditions and business expansion `` took a dive'' in the latest small-business survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. While the results indicate a definite slowing of the 77-month expansion, economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who designed the survey, said it did not portend a recession. He expects growth to continue at a 2 percent annual rate. `` The word is ` cooling,''' he said. The April survey is one of a quarterly series that obtains responses from nearly 2,000 smaller businesses _ a series that over the past decade has had a high degree of accuracy in forecasting the general economy six months ahead. In an overview of the survey results, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said the outlook for business conditions and business expansion resulted in the most negative set of figures since the second quarter of 1980. He said the findings indicate a slowdown in growth of the gross national product, employment, inventories and capital spending, and an upturn in unemployment and inflation. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who is dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of business and management, said inflation reports from the responding companies also added up to `` the most unfavorable set of inflation figures in the expansion.'' Only 9 percent of respondents reported lower selling prices in the first quarter, while a `` stunning'' 36 percent said they raised prices. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said they plan to raise prices in the next six months. In spite of this, he emphasized that inflation is n't rampant. He forecast a 5.6 percent annual rate for the second quarter, up from 5.3 percent in the first quarter and 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 1988. While such percentages might seem modest when matched against the double-digit rates of the 1970s, they are sharply higher than the rates reported in 1986, when the quarterly percentages never exceeded 2.6 percent. Summarizing the outlook in an interview, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said there will be a slowdown in growth, but there will be growth. In fact, he even saw a bright side to the slowdown, saying it will relieve a lot of pent-up pressure. He likened it to an earth tremor that forestalls a destructive earthquake, saying a slowdown relieves upward pressure on interest rates, reduces the price stress of consumer demand and allows needed slack to develop in plant capacity. At the same time, he said, the next few months represent a ticklish time for economic policy. With the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> apparently using interest rates to deal with existing as well as feared inflation, a downturn could occur. He views a slow-moving economy as being vulnerable to shocks and surprises, pointing out that among other things a considerable amount of credit has been extended to consumers in the expectation of continued steady employment. `` In the event that this economy falters, fiscal policy is on the ropes,'' he said, explaining that easy money, in contrast to today's relatively tight money, may be the only solution.

<HEAD>Record $4 Billion In Junk Bonds Offered in RJR Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The largest deal in history has spawned the largest corporate bond offering: $ 4 billion in junk bonds to help finance the $ 24.53 billion debt-financed takeover of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The huge high-yield bond issue has been the talk of Wall Street for weeks, with market strategists and investors giving it great importance because of a recent lapse in the junk bond business and fears of an economic slowdown. It also throws the spotlight on lead underwriter <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as it tackles the record deal without <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the junk bond industry's chief architect who is under indictment and out of commission indefinitely. `` It's huge,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` Four billion dollars is a lot of money to raise in this market.'' The offer by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which became effective Friday, dwarfs other corporate debt issues. <ORGANIZATION> BCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 offered $ 2.5 billion in non-investment grade bonds and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the same year offered $ 2.48 billion in investment-grade bonds. No other offering has exceeded $ 2 billion. The RJR bonds are part of an $ 8 billion securities package to raise money for the takeover of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm that specializes in buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts. The bonds have high yields, partly because of fears that the sheer size of the offer would deter investment managers who do n't think the market can absorb the load In fact, some major institutions are tiptoeing around the non-investment grade bonds despite universal acclaim for their quality. `` When you have such quantities of merchandise thrown on the market, regardless of how the deep the market is, there is question about the appetite of any investor,'' said an executive at a major capital management group that is limiting its takings. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> priced some of the securities to yield 15 percent, more than 1 percentage point above what was initially planned. The complexity of the deal also could scare off some investors. Underwriters have structured the bond sales in several tiers, with the same securities having different prices depending on the amount purchased. Also, interest rates on some securities will be reset at certain dates. `` It's a complicated transaction,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vila </PERSON>, a senior analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a credit rating agency. `` That's caused some difficulty with buyers.'' There also is some skepticism about <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to manage the deal without <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who took a leave of absence after pleading innocent to 98 counts of racketeering and securities fraud in March. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was working during <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of $ 5 billion in short-term <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> notes earlier this year, which was smoother than the company's attempt to drum up support of institutional investors for the current offer. `` The absence of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is apparent in the delays and the difficulties as have been perceived in the marketplace,'' the capital management executive said. But he added: `` They still have managed to do it. That's a credit to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s firepower.'' The issue lifts <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> back to the top of the junk bond market, with 50.2 percent of the $ 10.96 billion in bonds issued this year, its highest share since 1985 when it cornered 54.9 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had stumbled to a 15.9 percent first-quarter share, which analysts had attributed to the loss of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and the bad publicity over the firm's securities fraud woes The total financing for the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> transaction will approach $ 20 billion, including $ 4 billion in other securities such as preferred stock issued when the RJR-KKR takeover was completed in April. The RJR junk bonds are designed to replace the $ 5 billion in short-term bridge notes sold earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Some variations in the sale are designed to induce investors to exchange the short-term investment for long-term bonds. Despite its size and complexity, many traders believe the market can absorb the RJR issue because of the stability of the companies under the food and tobacco giant's umbrella. `` The credit strength is there,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is buying $ 7 million of the bonds for its $ 130 million portfolio. `` In a downturn, that credit is going to hold up better than a company that makes widgets to compete with the Japanese. These are pretty high visibility brand-name products.'' `` You have to step back from all the trees and look at the forest and say, ` Does RJR have value?' I think the answer is yes,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alelio </PERSON>, co-chief investment officer for high-yield bonds with the <ORGANIZATION> Putnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial services firm in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Analysts believe the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> sale will be a benchmark for the $ 180 billion a year junk bond market, which has been in a tailspin because of recession talk and a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> report that junk bonds may have a higher default rate than previously believed. `` I always think the more liquidity we have in the market the better we are,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a junk bond trader with <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think it's much easier when you have a visible name like this rather than a company nobody's ever heard of.''

 There's a three-syllable word Wall Street analysts are bandying around to describe the stock market's fickle mood: `` conviction.'' It's something they say the market _ or, rather, investors _ do n't have a whole lot of lately. Take, for example, the April report on producer prices. The market waited all week for Friday's data while traders talked of higher inflation and gloomy predictions of a recession. In the first 30 minutes after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average zoomed over 40 points, and remained near that level during most of the day. Traders had been expecting a number higher than the 0.4 percent rise the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Dow average closed 56.82 points higher Friday at 2,439.70, the highest level since the October 1987 stock market collapse and the biggest daily gain since a 74.68-point rise on May 31, 1988. The previous post-crash high was 2,418.99 at the close on April 27. The 57.74-point gain for the week was the third-best this year. Among other barometers, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 2.99 for the week to 175.13,; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 4.12 to 434.83; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index edged up 1.46 to 348.30. It seems, as one analyst put it, that investors are living and dying on each piece of economic data shoveled out by the government _ old data at that. `` The biggest problem the market faces is confusion and lack of conviction because of confusion,'' says <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It shows this market has little long-term conviction. Otherwise people would n't be so concerned with old news.'' Traders and the investing public hoped the numbers would unravel the previous week's confusion over the April employment report. The report showed more people were out of work _ an indication the economy might be slowing, while hourly earnings rose a substantial 7 cents _ hinting inflation's tentacles might be stretching. The jitters early in the week were reflected in the measly volume. Despite 221.49 million shares traded on Friday, the week's volume averaged just 160.87 million shares a day, down from 163.25 million the week before No sooner had some of the excitement died down than traders were talking about the upcoming consumer price data, another measure of inflation that some said might not produce the same favorable results. `` People want to keep the economy from overheating. But we keep getting mixed signals,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, head of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a critical period in a very fickle market _ a market with little conviction.'' The critical period amounts to a turning point in the economy, according to some economists. With no clear-cut, long-term direction, the market is relying on short-term measurements to give it a jolt even though, as one expert put it, gambling on the PPI does n't determine the value of a company. `` Even though there is no conviction with the market trend, it's difficult -LRB- for traders -RRB- to explain to clients why they have n't participated in the last 200 to 300 points,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, technical analyst with <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> `` It's a self-fulfilling thing. The market begins to gain steam and it pressures those underweighted in equities to come in and commit funds.'' Early in the week, the focus was on the Dow Jones industrial average and an eight-day losing streak, even though the average lost less over the eight sessions than it often has in one day. The explanation for the consecutive losses: `` It's no calamity, just a lack of conviction,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the overall uncertainty, some Wall Street analysts believe ingredients are accumulating for a strong upward move in the next 12 months. Money managers and large institutional investors are moving into the market in an orderly fashion, they say. `` The economy is at a turning point,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, director of economic research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` That's why investors and traders are keying on each statistic. They want to catch the turning point.''

 You rarely see white-gloved Avon ladies toting makeup samples door to door these days. And Tupperware parties have moved from the home to the office. The business of direct sales _ long personified by the salesperson grinning through the screen door and trying to get his or her foot in it _ has changed dramatically. Sales pitches have been adjusted to suit the busy, two-career times, and markets now stretch around the globe, not just around the block. When <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 2.1 billion takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last week, the deal focused attention on a business that has quietly shifted from blind calls to target marketing. `` It's just not productive to knock on doors at 10 o'clock in the morning anymore because no one's home,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hescock </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The random calling _ knocking on doors arbitrarily up one side of the street and down the other _ is clearly less prevalent,'' <PERSON> Hescock </PERSON> says. Increasingly, representatives of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> or other direct-selling outfits rely on previous contact with potential customers before seeking entry to their homes. `` The clear pattern is fewer and fewer calls that are made unannounced at the doorstep,'' according to <PERSON> Hescock </PERSON>. `` There is some degree of previous acquaintance, a vehicle creating an entree.'' Relationships with co-workers are being exploited. For instance, <ORGANIZATION> Tupperware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parties </ORGANIZATION>, known over the years for presenting its food storage containers to homemakers, now reaches out to customers with tight schedules with demonstrations during coffee breaks at work sites and rush hour parties at places convenient for people to drop in on their way home from work. About a quarter of the company's worldwide annual sales now come from such party alternatives. Direct sellers have had to alter their approaches because more of their customers _ still predominantly female _ are working outside the home. This shift also means a higher proportion of the women who typically fill most of the positions in the direct-selling sales force are employed in offices and other workplaces where they can deliver their sales pitches to colleagues. About 3.6 million people are involved in direct selling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and about 88 percent of them work at it part time. Eighty percent of the person-to-person sales force is female, according to industry figures. Besides empty houses, direct sellers have been motivated to modernize their methods by the personal safety concerns of their customers. Perhaps now more than ever before, people in high-crime pockets of the country might think opening their doors to strangers a foolish thing to do. A key reason why direct sellers felt they needed to make some changes was to preserve their profitability. After booming sales in the 1960s, they started to see their revenue growth stall in the early 1970s, partly due to an economic recession in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Much of the 1970s was a trying time for many direct sellers and the early 1980s did n't bring much relief. Traditional retailers were drawing away more customers who formerly favored direct sellers' wares, while fewer women were at home to recruit as sales agents and fewer were at home to buy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales in the direct-selling business were essentially flat from 1982 through 1986 but rebounded to a record $ 8.8 billion in 1987. The indications are that sales rose about 8 percent in 1988, setting a new high, the Direct Selling Association says. Some of the sales rebound can be attributed to the changes the direct sellers implemented. They clearly benefited from encouraging representatives to make more workplace solicitations, from enhancing the training of their sales reps and revamping their sales literature. The evolution of new non-store retailing techniques also helped by making consumers aware that there are ways to buy things without having to venture out to the suburban shopping malls. Those techniques include mail-order catalogs, home-shopping television networks, videotex units and direct, person-to-person, contacts. A recent report by the New York-based market research firm FIND-SVP says the development of non-store retailing is generating billions of dollars of sales that might never have existed if consumers only shopped at conventional retail establishments. The greatest growth opportunities for direct sellers lie outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is by far the biggest direct selling market in the world, about twice the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, by conservative estimates. Cultural factors largely account for the Japanese preference for buying things through direct-sales respresentatives. Even things like automobiles are sold in this manner in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Other <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> countries in which traditional retail distribution channels are not well developed also are considered high-growth areas by direct sellers. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, to name just three, have been identified as key countries for direct-selling expansion. Developing countries in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also appeal to direct sellers. In fact, the presence <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> apparently was one of the things that convinced competitor <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> to propose its takeover. The acquisition would fill a hole for <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, which already is peddling goods in more than 40 countries.

<HEAD>Stocks, Bonds Rally on News of Slower Inflation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A report that wholesale prices rose moderately in April triggered furious rallies in the stock and bond markets and sent interest rates reeling lower. The stock market posted its biggest one-day gain in nearly a year on Friday and bond prices recorded their largest advance since last September. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that despite a steep 7.2 percent climb in energy costs, wholesale prices rose only 0.4 percent in April or about half as much as many market watchers had expected. The rise in energy prices largely was offset by a broad fall in food prices and by a substantial decline in auto costs. The financial markets have been restrained in recent weeks by concerns that inflation was accelerating even as economic growth slowed. Those worries have deepened as oil prices have climbed, threatening to boost the costs of producing a wide range of items, including gasoline. But the price report appeared to reduce chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would be forced to push interest rates higher in a bid to restrain inflation. Rising interest rates put stock yields at a competitive disadvantage to those available on new issues of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills and notes, drive up the costs of business borrowing and erode the corporate earnings outlook. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 56.82 points to settle at a new post-crash high of 2,439.70. The Dow's previous high since its Oct. 19, 1987 crash was 2,418.99 set on April 27. Friday's gain was the biggest one-day rise since a 74.68-point jump on May 31, 1988. Broader market indicators also rose in active trading, with more than three issues gaining for every one that fell among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The indication of slowing inflation also helped the bond market, whose investors dread inflation because it erodes the value of fixed-income holdings such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes and bonds. Prices of some 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds posted gains of more than $ 23 for every $ 1,000 in face value, the biggest gain since a $ 26.62 advance last Sept. 2. Yields tumbled to 8.83 percent from 9.06 percent late Thursday. Yields on short-term Treasury issues also dropped as much as a quarter of a percentage point. The April advance in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index for finished goods, one stop short of retail, followed an identical 0.4 percent gain in March and 1 percent jumps in January and February. In a separate report Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories in March rose 0.3 percent while sales were flat, confirming earlier government statistics showing economic growth slowing. In another economic report, fixed-rate home mortgages slipped to an average of 10.93 percent this week compared with 10.97 percent last week, according to a national survey released by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.
