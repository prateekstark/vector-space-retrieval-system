 Three French hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1985 were freed Wednesday and headed home, and one of them said his liberation was `` a rebirth.'' The plane carring journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> stopped briefly in <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> on its way to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, it was met by Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> and a medical team. `` It's the most beautiful day of my life. There are no other words,'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> RTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, whose reporter <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> _ himself a former hostage _ was permitted to board the plane in <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION>. `` It's a rebirth, because for three years I wo n't say we lived, we survived,'' he said. `` It's the end of a nightmare, a nightmare that lasted three years and then some,'' Carton told <ORGANIZATION> RTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` At first we were together, then we were separated,'' he said. `` We saw other hostages, but we did not know exactly who they were.'' Wednesday's release leaves 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing and believed held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Moslem extremists. <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Veyret </PERSON>, the second secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Carton, 62, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, and <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, 44, were set free at 7:20 p.m. -LRB- 1:20 p.m. EDT -RRB- Wednesday near the Summerland Hotel in the seaside <LOCATION> Jnah </LOCATION> neighborhood of the Lebanese capital. There were reports in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> this week that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had agreed to pay <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> $ 670 million still owed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on a billion-dollar loan made by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. The French government froze payments after the 1979 Islamic revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were believed to have loyalties to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> both spoke of being blindfolded and chained. `` No longer to have a blindfold ... chains,'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said. `` I would n't say we were in a tomb but, after all, it is a little like that.'' <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said the hostages had heard little news. He did not know who was running in Sunday's second round of French presidential elections. `` I knew my wife fought for me, not only for me, but for us,'' he said. <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> made several trips to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and made frequent public appeals for the hostages' release. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said, `` To have had a blindfold over your eyes, and chains on your hands and feet, that makes a change. It is the difference between night and day.'' In <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who faces incumbent Socialist <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> the presidential election this Sunday, announced the men's release Wednesday at a campaign rally. `` I have been informed just now that the three French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were freed and have been turned over to a representative of the interior minister,'' he said. `` I am thinking of the horrible time they've been through, which they did n't deserve. ... I am thinking of the one who, alas, was the victim of these kidnappers and has not returned,'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said. He was referring to <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, 39, who was kidnapped May 22, 1985. Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group, claimed it killed him March 5, 1986. His body was not found, but his wife says <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials confirmed his death. A total of 10 French hostages now have been released since <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> took office in 1986. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, appearing later on national TV, expressed happiness about the release but sorrow for `` the one who did not return, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, and for his family, as well as for the foreign hostages still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was awaiting details of the release. `` We would be concerned by any sign that concessions were made,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We believe concessions encourage future kidnappings and could prolong the captivity of other hostages.'' The release followed weeks of reports that <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government was working feverishly, through contacts with the Iranian government and elsewhere, to win the men's freedom. Hostage negotiations, shrouded in official secrecy, were the subject of continuing press speculation. Last December, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> expelled 17 Iranian exile opponents of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, but denied this had any connection with hostage talks. French negotiator <PERSON> Jean-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiani </PERSON>, personal representative of French Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, met the freed captives at the headquarters of the Syrian army in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, embassy secretary <PERSON> Veyret </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marchiani </PERSON>, a former intelligence officer, made several trips to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in recent weeks. He had negotiated the freedom of two other French captives, <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON>, last November. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> said in a statement: `` As in the past, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> exerted efforts to ensure the release of hostages.'' <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> said the former hostages would be taken to a military hospital in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation quoted a reporter at the Summerland hotel as saying the three Frenchmen were brought there in a black Mercedes that had no license plates. Carton, the embassy vice consul in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, an embassy protocol officer, had been missing since March 22, 1985. Islamic Jihad said its members kidnapped them. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, a journalist working for the weekly magazine L'Envenement <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeudi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, an academic researcher, were kidnapped May 22, 1985. The longest-held foreign hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The November release of <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON> reportedly involved <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> agreeing to let <PERSON> Wahid </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordji </PERSON>, an employee at the Iranian Embassy, leave <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gordji </PERSON> was wanted for questioning in connection with terrorist bombings.

<HEAD>Lebanon Action Shows Willingness To Use Military Might</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The army's thrust into south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> may signal a new phase in a simmering guerrilla war, one in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> again is ready to use its military might even if it means raising tensions with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The fact that helicopter-borne troops landed Tuesday in a village only four miles from Syrian lines in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was likely to be viewed as a challenge by <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s initial reaction was to put its troops on alert. But there was no corresponding war of words, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials stressed they sought to avoid a confrontation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` Our intentions are limited. We are not out there to go to war with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> but simply to control the security of our northern border settlements,'' said Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman. `` We made it very clear to the Syrians as well as the population in the area that we intend to complete this search mission and return our forces back,'' he said in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The disclaimers were reinforced by the makeup of the mechanized brigade that entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Only a few tanks were involved, and the use of artillery was extremely limited. `` It was not a combat force,'' said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers reported seeing six Israeli F-4 Phantom jets fire 30 missiles in the direction of Syrian lines in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers said a SAM-6 surface-to-air missile was launched, but there was no confirmation from either side. The last war of nerves with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> came in November 1985 after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes patroling over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> chased two <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> jets into Syrian airspace and shot them down. Some observers said tensions with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would divert attention from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where the army has been fighting daily battles with rioters since Dec. 8. But Israeli officials rejected such suggestions and insisted the primary motive was to keep <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas from building up new bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> like the ones they had before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion. `` This operation is aimed at searching for the terrorists, at trying to locate groups and weaponry, and to deliver a message to residents of the villages ... that we would not agree to an increase of hostile activity,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, the head of the northern command. The new strike into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was an unusually well-publicized campaign accompanied by a stream of public statements. It seemed designed more to send a warning about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s readiness to use the military option than it was to fulfill the declared mission of capturing guerrillas. The warning was directed at the Palestinian factions who carry out the raids, at the Syrians who provide the protective umbrella and at villagers who provide guides and shelter. There was also a hint of more to come if the infiltrations continued. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new thrust into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was the army's first major ground offensive since February 1986, overcoming a reluctance to get involved in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that lingered from an unpopular three-year occupation ending in 1985. `` We will not wait to engage in defensive activity only ... and we want to initiate activity in the field which would make it harder for terrorist groups to operate,'' said <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>. The new campaign in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, like last month's assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, appeared designed to show off <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military potency. Many believe such actions will help restore the army's image as a force to be reckoned with, an image that has suffered as a result of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> riots and guerrilla infiltrations. `` The message is we will get the terrorists whereever they are,'' said an army official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But to a nation suspicious of any longterm involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio `` I think there is totally no danger of entanglement.'' The army was prodded to go into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by a rebirth of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla activity in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had amassed a large military presence before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion. A dozen infiltration attempts since last November have claimed 11 Israeli lives and alarmed residents living along <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border They have in turn put pressure on the government to take action. There has also been a marked increase in attacks on a 2,000-man Israeli-allied Lebanese militia and the few hundred <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops permanently stationed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In March, there were 105 anti-Israeli operations mounted by Palestinians, Lebanese Communists and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems, said a security official in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> who monitors the warfare. Two pro-Israeli militiamen were killed in the March fighting along with eight guerrillas. Three Israelis and 16 fighters in the Israeli-backed militia were wounded. The official said it was the highest monthly casualty count since October 1985, when there were 130 operations in which six pro-Israeli militiamen were killed and 8 others wounded.

<TEXT>
 In its confrontation with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seems to have been maneuvered into an awkward position by the military strongman. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had pledged to remove the commander of the Defense Forces, the de facto ruler of this country, from office and from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Now the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appears to be offering <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a deal he had hinted at more than a month ago: that he leave power, but not the country. He also wants his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments on drug trafficking charges invalidated. The apparent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy shift has managed to alienate opposition leaders. They now privately use the word `` incompetence'' when referring to the way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has handled the general. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied on Saturday that he had reached any agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on Sunday that talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continued during the weekend and that `` progress is being made.'' Initially, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> encouraged the opposition as it demanded both <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster and exile. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions and froze Panamanian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, causing a severe economic crisis in this country, where the dollar is the legal currency. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognized as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, a man <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> himself had picked as president and whose only merit, opposition leaders say, was that he later tried to fire the general. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a military leader with the populist tactics of a Latin American politician, vowed he would not leave under pressure. He clung to power in spite of the crisis, whipping up Panamanian nationalism and the sympathy that <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations feel for anyone who confronts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The gringos overestimated the opposition and underestimated <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the general. As late as April 16, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were telling opposition members the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position had not changed, and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had to leave soon. `` If they -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- are now offering a deal that would enable <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to stay in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, then it is a serious mistake,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` All Panamanians know that allowing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to stay in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not a solution,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party. Concerned about a possible U.S.-Noriega deal that might bypass them, the opposition parties met on Monday for the first time `` to discuss the serious crisis we are suffering.'' The opposition includes the National Civic Crusade, an umbrella organization of private, professional and labor groups that since June has mounted demonstrations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule. Opposition leaders feel the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government created <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by sustaining his 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and allowing him to impose and depose presidents during the past five years. `` The change in attitude on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to support democratization in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> now is not the result of solidarity with our people,'' said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. `` It merely recognizes that its interests in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are more compatible with the struggle for democracy than with the support of a dictatorial regime.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has insisted that the American decision to topple him was political because he refused to cooperate with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to involve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in incidents to embarrass the leftist Sandinista regime in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supports the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said on Saturday that he would not leave unless the `` popular forces,'' meaning the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and his political base, `` negotiate their security.'' `` He will leave on his terms now,'' said an opposition party leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Aides said the general also wants the economic sanctions lifted. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is more concerned about lifting the economic sanctions than any discussion about his departure,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` He is not going to resign under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure and he is not going into exile,'' he said. `` We have learned to be wary of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a country that historically had been our friend.''

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top two confectioners, <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and Kit Kat-maker <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, have become tempting targets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Swiss bidders in what the British have dubbed the candy bar wars. The bidding and stake-building reflect a trend among consumer companies to go global by acquiring existing, strong brands, which are almost prohibitively expensive to create from scratch, analysts say. The moves also reflect Swiss companies' concerns about the approach of 1992, when the Common Market is to become one barrier-free market of 320 million consumers. Because <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> is not a member, Swiss companies are eager to buy operations within the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Felicity </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The candy bar wars also underscore the key roles <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> play in the industry and the importance of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a confectionery market. The two companies rank among the world's largest chocolate-makers, as do the Swiss suitors for <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A </ORGANIZATION>. The American company <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which said it wants to increase its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, has interests in movie theaters and soft drink bottling. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ the third-largest chocolate consuming country in the world after <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> has the largest share of the $ 3.9 billion chocolate market, or 30 percent, according to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Henderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crosthwaite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> comes in a second with 26 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is third with 24 percent, the firm said <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s brands also include <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Dry soft drinks. Many Britons are not happy that two of their venerable institutions are being raided by foreigners. `` The fate of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Yorkie bar has stirred the nation into a fit of patriotism,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. `` The Little English lobby has been in a lather ...'' Rowntree has n't made a direct approach to the government about possible intervention, but it is discussing the matter with `` one or two people,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on Tuesday. In accordance with British practice, the spokesman was n't identified In <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s case, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION>, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said last week that it would increase its 17.7 percent stake in the British company, possibly through a tender offer. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, whose brands include <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Mounds and Almond Joy candy bars, said any involvement or interference from General Cinema would be `` unwelcome, and strongly resisted.'' It was more than a year ago that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> first became a major shareholder in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, whose shares fell 15 cents to finish at $ 6.51 on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>, which is based in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, last week became the reluctant target of a hostile, $ 3.9 billion bid from <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest food company with interests in chocolate and coffee. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, which has acquired almost 7 percent of <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, offered $ 16.64 a share for the company, which rejected the bid. The offer from <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> _ whose brands include <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s Crunch _ is said to be the largest by a non-British bidder for a British company. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, also recently reached an agreement to acquire the Buitoni SpA foods group, including its <ORGANIZATION> Perugina </ORGANIZATION> chocolates business, from <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. Separately, competing suitor <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>, another Swiss company with chocolate and coffee interests, has amassed a 21 percent stake in <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, which did n't welcome that move, either. Zurich-based <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>, which makes the triangular Toblerone chocolate bars, initially paid $ 11.78 a share for its Rowntree shares. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s shares finished at $ 17.30, up nine cents, on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> currently has a 3 percent share and <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>, 2 percent, of the British chocolate market. `` What it is all about is globalization of consumer products markets,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, a food analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Henderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crosthwaite </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have the multinational companies at the moment trying to accumulate tremendous brand strength in a narrow product line, but internationally.'' <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> added: `` The scramble for shelf space is some of it and the big brands are the only ones that can get it.'' `` Satellite advertising and international travel are creating a greater homogenization,'' <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said. `` The supermarket shelves of the world are starting to look like one another.'' Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a Quaker grocer's shop in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in the 18th century, had pre-tax profit of $ 210 million on sales of $ 2.67 billion in 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, which began as a seller of tea and coffee in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in 1824, had pre-tax profit of $ 329 million on revenue of $ 3.8 billion last year.

<HEAD>$12,000 for Prep School? Is It Worth It???

 Convincing parents that top prep schools are `` worth'' tuitions exceeding $ 10,000 is n't always easy. But even harder are the challenges of ensuring classrooms are filled in future years with ethnically diverse students and faculty.

 Perhaps the least of the challenges facing the private school that proclaims itself `` the pearl of the Midwest'' is explaining to parents why it's worth $ 12,000 annual tuition. The 300-acre campus of <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingswood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> has the requisite prep-school luxuries: a hockey arena, bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players' strokes are videotaped, and an old-time swimming hole called <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonah </PERSON>, so named because it's shaped like a whale For its 800 students, each day is an aesthetic feast _ from the tapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobs and lunchroom chairs. These, and practically everything else, were designed or influenced by famed Finnish architect <PERSON> Eliel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saarinen </PERSON>, who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950. But just as the virtues of top private schools like this are n't just skin-deep, neither are the problems With the school-age population declining and prep school tuitions sometimes rivaling <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> colleges, officials worry about future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets from coast to coast. The nation's approximately 1,700 independent private schools, those not receiving tax or church funds, enroll some 600,000 students, up 9.7 percent over the last decade. But the number of students taking private school admissions tests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>. A few years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingswood </ORGANIZATION> could almost fill its classes with students just from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and surrounding <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states. Now the school recruits from as far away as southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` If we did n't do that kind of thing we would n't be in good shape in five years because of the demographics. The best schools are out there all the time,'' said admissions director <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kridler </PERSON>, whose travel budget has risen from $ 500 to $ 15,000 in recent years, and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17 states. Like other prep schools, <PERSON> Cranbrook </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingswood </PERSON> has constantly fought a perception of elitism. The formerly all-white, predominantly <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON> school is now 25 percent Jewish and 25 percent `` persons of color'' including Indians, Asian-Americans and blacks, a change due largely to aggressive minority student recruiting and a $ 15.8 million endowment that helps make sizable scholarships possible. <PERSON> Cranbrook </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingswood </PERSON> is the most expensive boarding school in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and among the most expensive in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But it is a bargain compared with the priciest Eastern schools. <ORGANIZATION> Leland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is the nation's most expensive private college preparatory school, charging $ 18,500 for a year's tuition, fees, room and board. <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingswood </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 12,000, ranks 44th in the nation. Another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers. Of 90 upper-school faculty members, four are black, one is Hispanic, one is Asian-American. But such challenges seem remote at 8 a.m. as English teacher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayroian </PERSON> poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for a dozen students, about half the size of most public school classes. He kicked off a discussion on the religious and moral implications of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON>'s classic `` Siddhartha'': `` Should we prepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle?'' he asked. `` What should be the relationship between technology and the holy?'' In <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s biology lab, nine juniors toil on a typically complex question: At what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plants absorb the most light? `` They use a college text,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. `` And I do n't give them a whole lot of answers.'' `` Academically I've never seen anything like it,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> from nearby <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, whose daughter <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> is an 11th-grade day student. `` Public school kids might come home at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, but my daughter typically is n't home until 6 or 7 at night, and then she buries herself in the books.'' It's a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be in their rooms studying every evening Sunday through Thursday. Upon graduation, each student's name is hand-carved into the oak walls of Alumni Court. Those names include such luminaries as <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Senator <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON>, who leaked the Pentagon Papers; poet <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leithauser </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> editor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>. Nonetheless, schools that tout themselves as training grounds for future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply ca n't ignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer, said school president and acting director <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> Yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NAIS </ORGANIZATION>'s own statistics. In 1986-87, independent school enrollments were 4.7 percent black, 1.8 percent Hispanic, 4.7 percent Asian-American and 0.1 percent Native American. `` I recruit in <LOCATION> Cabrini </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kridler </PERSON>, referring to an all-black <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> housing project, `` and I go to Mexican-American neighborhoods. `` Inner city kids think we're not affordable. I talk a lot about financial aid opportunities,'' <PERSON> Kridler </PERSON> said. About 24 percent of students in the upper school, grades 9-12, get financial aid, covering two-thirds of need on average. Still, 22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons. Low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration, especially for younger faculty, even though median salaries have risen $ 7,000 in five years. Nationally, beginning private school teachers make $ 12,000-19 ,000 and average salaries for all such teachers was $ 23,000, about $ 5,000 less than public school teachers Fayroian, a 25-year-old first-year teacher, earns $ 16,300. He says he is up at 4 a.m. and in bed at midnight, spending his day and evening grading papers, teaching classes and meeting with students. The salary `` can be disheartening for the amount of work we do,'' he said. Top scale at <LOCATION> Cranbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingswood </LOCATION> is $ 34,000, and the median is $ 25,600. There's no teacher union and no tenure. On the other hand, private school teachers generally have more freedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free of bureaucratic interference. At <LOCATION> Cranbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingswood </LOCATION>, the resulting curriculum is so rigorous many students find college easy by comparison. The school recently studied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades often improved compared with their grades at <LOCATION> Cranbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingswood </LOCATION>. Students who averaged 2.0 to 2.5 at the prep school averaged 2.86 as college freshmen, for example. What makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily high probability of admission to one of the better <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges. Of 190 graduates in 1987, 187 went to college, 14 as national merit finalists. Their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores averaged 1100 of a possible 1600, compared with a national average of 906. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Botvinick </PERSON>, a 17-year-old senior from <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, whose public schools lead the state, nonetheless chose to come here and was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brainard </PERSON>, a 12th grader from <LOCATION> Crosslands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, says there's no comparison between what she gets here and what she would have gotten at her hometown school `` Private schools are very stereotyped,'' she said. `` People think they're very snobby. But we're not; we come here for the education. I do n't know what my chances would have been at <ORGANIZATION> Nitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crosslands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has guided hundreds of illegal aliens to new jobs and new lives, escorting them through the hills and canyons dividing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But fear has kept the 29-year-old alien smuggler from seeking a new way of life for himself as time runs out on the yearlong amnesty program. `` I do n't want to lose my money, my family, my house,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent who accompanied two journalists Sunday. `` I want to know if I can make it -LRB- pass legalization requirements -RRB- or not.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said he has documentation from three employers and has spent 15 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But, he said, he feared his dozens of arrests for alien smuggling would make him ineligible for amnesty and lead to his deportation. His wife and three children live in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said. At sunset Sunday, hundreds of illegal aliens, mainly Mexicans, gathered on the so-called Soccer Field on <LOCATION> Otay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> just north of the international border in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The site is about 12 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Most were waiting for darkness before venturing north. Vendors hawked used clothing, coffee, beer, tostadas. Many people knew little about the immigration law. Several who believed they qualified for amnesty had n't realized the time to apply runs out midnight Wednesday. Many aliens were uncertain whether they would find work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but they were convinced the odds were more favorable there than in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or South or <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Some people took advantage of bilingual Agent <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>'s unusual presence among them to press for information about the immigration law <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>, a 12-year veteran of the border force, was amused by the attention. `` One asked me what time was the best to cross. I said, ` No hour, because I'm going to be there looking for you.' They all got a good laugh.'' `` If there is only three more days then you should give us a chance to cross tonight,'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 23, a native of the Mexican state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, suggested to <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>. `` If we no find work, we'll come back -LRB- to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB- and leave you without work.'' To qualify for amnesty under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, illegal aliens must prove they have been living continuously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982. Under the law, employers face sanctions if they hire illegals without documentation. So far, the new law does n't appear to have lessened the Border Patrol's workload. Arrest figures, accepted as a measure of border traffic, dropped 30 percent last year but have steadily increased this year. In April, agents in the agency's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sector arrested 41,815 illegal aliens, 20 percent more than were apprehended the same month last year. In April 1986, 71,910 undocumented migrants were arrested.

 Long before `` What's your sign?'' replaced `` Come here often?'' as a lounge lizard's opening line, people sought their fortune in the stars, planets and signs of the zodiac. Astrology assumes that the planets and stars, in some way, predict or rule the lives of humans. Soothsayers searched the skies for omens in Babylon of the 18th century B.C., but what is now known as astrology developed during the Hellenistic period from the 3rd century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D., according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The World Book Encyclopedia says that astrological forecasts, or horoscopes, are based on four elements: the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the planets, the zodiac _ the 12 signs that divide up the heavens and comprise an astrological year _ and 12 `` houses,'' or elements of personality associated with 12 imaginary divisions of the Earth's surface. Astrology assumes the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is the center of the solar system. `` Newtonian physics eradicated a belief in astrology among the educated. The practice of the now pseudoscience continued among nonintellectuals in the West, gradually losing contact with its rich tradition and becoming more and more fraudulent,'' the encyclopedia says. But popular interest in astrology grew after newspapers began printing horoscopes in the 1930s. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is known to have consulted astrologers, as did his deputy, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, who was captured on a bizarre peace mission to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1941. Sir <PERSON> Ivone </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1941, said that <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> was `` a simple, stupid'' person whose astrologer had told him he would bring peace.

With about 70 percent of the vote counted, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 41,694 or 80.2 percent, while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 9,215 or 17 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> captured 13 of the district's 16 Democratic convention delegates with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> winning 3.

 A ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> says the Democratic leadership has tried to quash a non-partisan report indicating that an increase in the minimum wage to $ 5.05 could cost up to 500,000 jobs. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that handled the minimum wage legislation, said Tuesday that the Democratic leadership is not interested in objective analysis `` They're just interested in ramming their bill through with brute force _ no matter who gets hurt,'' <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> said in a floor statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> studied the Democratic-sponsored legislation, which would raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 5.05 an hour over the next four years. <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> said that although the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> found the legislation could wipe out 500,000 jobs and boost inflation, `` the folks who run the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> did n't want that kind of information, and ordered it removed from the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> report before the minority could see it.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greigg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said it followed its normal procedure of sending a copy of the report to both Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., labor committee chairman, and Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>., ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` We followed the same procedure we always do,'' said <PERSON> Greigg </PERSON>. `` A copy went to both of them simultaneously. We were baffled by the suggestion -LRB- of <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> -RRB- that he made three requests for a copy of the report.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the minimum wage bill sometime this month. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>, the research arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has disputed news reports that the agency has become politicized in issuing a report on the cost estimates of the legislation. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> acting chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said the budget office was `` fully responsive to the requests made of us by the committee staff and that nothing has transpired to change the non-partisan, professional conduct of our office.'' At the specific request of the staff, <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> provided the committee with an assessment of the possible impact of the measure on the economy. `` Our cost estimates normally provide information only on the possible budget impacts for federal, state and local governments,'' <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, committee staff director, sent a letter last Thursday to all panel members in which she said the staff requested <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> to provide a second submission `` because the first <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> cost estimate included an analysis not required by the Budget Act or House Rules for inclusion in the committee's report.'' `` This analysis has been available to any member requesting it, and the staff's action in requesting CBO to conform ... in no way constituted suppression of the analysis or improper pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.''

 African guerrilla leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> is asking presidential hopefuls <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into relinquishing control over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the territory known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said he had met with campaign managers who promised him a meeting with the two Democratic candidates within the coming week. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not responded to a similar request for a meeting, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, 58, said that despite claims to the contrary, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is trying to strengthen its hold over the mineral-rich territory which it rules in defiance of a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for Namibian independence. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who lives in exile in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, accused South African troops of arson and bombing attacks against <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents, including the burning of 14 church-run schools last month. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has denied the charges, accusing <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> of the attacks. South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> paid a rare visit to the territory on April 8, and proposed increased powers for his chief representative there. The proposal would weaken the `` transitional'' government established by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1985 with a view to eventual independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has no intention whatsoever to leave <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>. The South Africans will have to be `` forced out by the combined resistance of the Namibian people and international pressure.'' He called on the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to pursue steps similar to the trade sanctions legislated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said he had requested a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> but had not received any response. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> had asked for a meeting, and said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had yet to reply. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been criticized by conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, such as Rep. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., for allowing <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> into the country in view of his organization's guerrilla activities and support from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> In a letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> called <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> a `` terrorist and Soviet puppet.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports a South African pullout and an independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but its contacts with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> have been limited. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives are taking part in two days of talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with representatives from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on a plan for the pullout of South African forces from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has an estimated 37,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Estimates for the South African military presence in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> range from 40,000 to 100,000. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said he was sure <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would protect his group's interests at the talks and press its demands for Namibian independence `` It will be a package, I am assured of this by the Angolan government,'' he said. If an agreement is worked out, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> will stop its attacks against South African troops, he said. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> says it killed more than 90 South Africans this year, but its claims can not be verified. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> conceded that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> gets most of its arms and training from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and several other members of the Organization of African Unity. But he added that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to supply <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> with weapons, `` we will certainly accept it with great pleasure.'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> is on a three-week visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to attend several U.N.-sponsored seminars on <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and to highlight his organization's demands.

 The 1988 campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> slows dramatically in coming weeks, with only a handful of primaries through the rest of May as the candidates gather strength for a final push into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is coasting a bit after winning <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Tuesday, making his record 7-1 in recent primaries. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won Tuesday's primary in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The front-runner will campaign in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> _ the site of next week's contests _ for a day later this week before taking some time off in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Not only has <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> surged nearly 600 delegates ahead <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, his only remaining rival, but the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is also favored to win the lion's share of the remaining eight primaries, including the biggest prize of all _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with 314 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> delegates at stake. That single state, with more delegates than the other remaining states combined, will host most of the campaigning for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the next five weeks. Each candidate plans at least 10 days there. Republican nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be campaigning across the country in the coming weeks, even though he already has enough delegates to win the nomination at the GOP National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. He will spend considerable time in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and not to campaign against <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who technically remains in the race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, is looking to the general election campaign when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will once again be the biggest electoral prize of all on Nov. 8. The next stops on the 1988 presidential trail for both parties come next Tuesday in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The campaigns have spent little time in the states, since only 62 Democratic delegates are at stake and 37 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ones on May 10. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads the polls in both. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> edge over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was 43-14 in a recent poll of likely Democratic voters. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, a poll taken last week put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 54 percent and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 15 percent among registered voters. Then on May 17, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> weighs in with the first <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> primary. Once again <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is ahead in the polls, taking a 36-24 margin over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in one recent survey. Forty-five Democratic delegates will be awarded that day, as will 32 Republican slots. The next week brings <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which holds a Democratic beauty contest primary with no delegates at stake. The delegates were allocated in a caucus system that began March 8. On the Republican side, 18 delegates are available. After a two-week pause comes the primary season finale for the Democrats. With <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leading the way, 466 Democratic and 265 Republican delegates will be awarded that day in balloting that also includes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Next to Super Tuesday on March 8 _ when most of the Southern and border states held primaries _ June 7 is the biggest delegate day of the 1988 primary season. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the leader again in the polls. The latest <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Poll gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 44-33 edge over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 14 percent undecided. The final <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary day of 1988 is June 14, when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> votes. There was to be a beauty contest on the Democratic side, but no one filed to win a place on the ballot. Sixteen delegates are at stake on the Republican side, but no major candidate filed to oppose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. In addition to the primaries, at least eight other states and territories will be allocating <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> delegates in the next five weeks. On Friday, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> will hold its state convention to choose 20 delegates and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> will do the same on Saturday for six delegates. On May 14, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> hold either state conventions or congressional district meetings to pick Republican delegates. On May 21, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> make their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> choices. And <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s June 4 state convention will pick 36 Republican delegates.

 Veterinarians urged cat owners in <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to keep their pets indoors after 25 cats became sickened, apparently by a deadly illness that may be linked to a wild bird disease.

<HEAD>Environmentalists in House Fight To Stop Refuge Drilling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Environmentalists are looking to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in their efforts to reverse a congressional tide that is running toward oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The focus of the biggest energy-vs. - environment battle of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> shifted to that panel Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill to open the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> preserve to <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> drilling </ORGANIZATION> foes said he is optimistic about stopping the bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., who opposes developing the nation's largest refuge `` It's been a friendlier committee to us traditionally,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` The committee is always split 50-50 on tough developmental issues. ... Our strategy is pretty simple. We believe in the just-say-no strategy.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> and other anti-drilling lobbyists are trying to slow down the bill, which is similar to a measure approved narrowly earlier this year by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said he thinks the chance of a drilling bill getting through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year are `` very low. There are a lot of people who prefer not to vote on controversial issues in an election year.'' Drilling opponents hope to stall final action until 1989 on the theory that a new administration will be less eager than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to develop the 1.5 million acre coastal plain of the 19-million-acre refuge. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has pledged to make the coastal plain a no-development wilderness area. Drilling advocates, including <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, say the refuge's potentially rich oil deposits must be tapped as soon as possible in order to reduce the nation's growing dependence on imported petroleum. The <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved its drilling bill 28-13 after rejecting bipartisan pleas by some members that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> postpone a decision on the issue until a new president can study the matter and formulate a new national energy policy. `` This is the first positive energy step we've made since 1973,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, a principal proponent of tapping what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the oil industry say may be a major supply of petroleum. Young was referring to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' approval of the pipeline that carries Alaskan oil from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the huge field about 70 miles west of the refuge boundary and the source of about 20 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production. An opponent, Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the drilling legislation backed by <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and crafted by chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, was `` ill-conceived and ill-timed. `` The resources of the Arctic will wait, and we can await the arrival of a new president and a new energy secretary,'' said <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, predicting a bitter battle if drilling legislation reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` We will have a donneybrook of such dimensions that it will be recalled for some time,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> predicted. The <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> bill would allow drilling to begin within 21 months of enactment. It would bar rigs from a caribou calving area and earmark federal revenue from refuge oil for national wildlife and conservation programs. The closest drilling opponents got to victory was a 23-18 vote against a plan to allow pre-leasing activities, which would take two or more years, to be carried out while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> studied the nation's future energy needs and how they could be filled by conservation and renewable sources of energy. The foes also tried to add language to force the administration to reverse its decision to lower the auto fleet economy standard from 27.5 mpg to 26 mpg. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., said that over the long term oil saved this way could equal what the refuge may contain

 An inspection has found no mechanical problems with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that landed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on one engine after three of its engines lost power during a flight over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the airline says. United spokesmen refused to speculate on what caused the incident, although they say the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 has been found to be airworthy and was being flown today without passengers from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. That appeared to lend credence to a theory that the engine problems may have stemmed from a pilot error in shifting fuel among the jet's four fuel tanks. Industry and government sources, asking not to be identified by name, said Tuesday that the plane landed with three of its fuel tanks empty and not feeding three of the huge jet's engines, causing them to stop operating. During a flight, fuel routinely is transferred among the four tanks to maintain the aircraft's balance. According to these sources, more than 20,000 pounds of fuel was left in a fourth tank feeding the engine that continued to operate. The jetliner with 258 passengers and crewmembers aboard landed safely at the <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with only the one engine providing power. The pilot had reported losing the first engine at 39,000 feet about 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport, a second engine 30 minutes later and a third engine just before landing. `` The airplane has been thoroughly inspected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We have not found a mechanical problem. ... The airplane is airworthy enough to ferry it back to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franicsco </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> refused to speculate what caused the engine problem, but said the plane had 23,500 pounds of fuel left when it landed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Monday, 7,500 pounds more than the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requires and 4,500 pounds more than the airline requires. But he said he did not know the distribution of the fuel among the jumbo jet's four tanks. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds. Other aviation and government sources said Tuesday that the fuel was in the tank that powered the engine that continued to operate, although it has yet to be determined whether the improper distribution of the fuel was caused by mechanical problem or flight crew error. `` Each of the four engines is independent and has its own fuel lines drawing from the tanks in the wing. ... You can interchange fuel from tank to tank,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Such fuel transfers in the older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-100 series aircraft are often performed manually, according to another <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, although she said she did not know the procedure used on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> aircraft involved in Monday's incident. Industry and government sources, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said that a mechanical problem such as a fuel line or filter clog or malfunctioning valve might have kept the crew from transferring the fuel. Another possibility is that the flight crew shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank and was unable to transfer it back to the other tanks, said one aviation source. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials, the aircraft has a variety of gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been burned, how much fuel remains and the fuel flow rates for each tank. The incident is being investigated by Japanese authorities, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air safety investigators also are interested in the case. <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said staffers plan to talk to pilots of the plane when they return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Higher speed limits on rural interstate highways are having no discernible effect on traffic fatalities, probably due to stricter enforcement, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> says. `` A 55 mph limit that is not enforced can be more of a problem than a 65 mph limit that is enforced,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday after a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. A law enacted last year over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto allows states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph on rural stretches of interstate highways, 10 mph faster than the national 55 mph speed limit enacted in 1974 as an energy conservation measure. Forty states have adopted the higher speed limit. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> declined to provide specific figures to support his conclusion, saying they will be provided to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a report being prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're just not finding any distinction'' between fatalities on the 65 mph rural interstate highways and those where the speed limit remained at 55 mph, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. The fatality statistics `` are all over the board,'' with deaths rising in some states and falling in others on 65 mph stretches of highway, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFore </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The only official statistic on the issue has been provided by <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in congressional testimony. She said that in the months after the federal law took effect, the agency found increases between 18 percent and 23 percent on rural interstates in states that raised the limit. <PERSON> DeFore </PERSON>, however, said it is difficult to assess the effect of the higher speed limit because of possible variations in other safety factors, such as enforcement. In his speech, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said Americans `` are becoming more safety conscious,'' citing a 14 percent decline in the number of drunken drivers involved in fatal auto accidents between 1982 and 1986. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it believes the higher speed limit is causing more deaths. `` We have a very strong and clear indication from across the nation that average speeds have increased and more people are dying and sustaining more severe injuries on these roads,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, the council's federal affairs director, in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> surface transportation subcommittee. She said she expects statistics to show 500 additional highway deaths annually as a result of the higher speed limit.

<TEXT>
 Wild raccoons on a remote <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal island will become subjects in a test of a genetically-engineered rabies vaccine if the federal government approves a plan proposed by a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> biomedical institute. The <ORGANIZATION> Wistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> announced a proposal Tuesday to test the vaccine this fall on an island that will be selected off the coast of either <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The experiment, said <LOCATION> Wistar </LOCATION> officials, is part of an international plan to eradicate rabies, a disease that has plagued humans and animals since ancient times. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupprecht </PERSON>, an assistant professor at <LOCATION> Wistar </LOCATION>, said the vaccine, in a liquid form, would be placed into baits designed to attract wild raccoons. The baits then would be distributed on the selected island. Later, he said, captured raccoons would be examined to determine if they have eaten the bait and become immune to rabies. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wunner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wistar </ORGANIZATION> professor, said the baits would consist of a sponge filled with the vaccine and then sealed with a wax. The baits would be coated with a scent as an attractant. He said laboratory tests have shown that when raccoons bite into the baits they absorb the vaccine through the lining of their mouths. <PERSON> Rupprecht </PERSON> said the process has been shown to be effective in tests on thousands of animals of 15 different species in the laboratory. The test would be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use in the wild of a virus made with recombinant DNA technology. But the same vaccine now is being used in field tests on foxes in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and will start soon in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Other types of rabies vaccines have been used in field tests in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheston </PERSON>, associated director of <LOCATION> Wistar </LOCATION>, said the engineered vaccine was made by removing one of five genes from the rabies virus and splicing it into the genetic pattern of the vaccinia virus, which is the virus used to make smallpox vaccines for human innoculations. <PERSON> Cheston </PERSON> said that because the technology uses a harmless gene from the rabies virus, the resulting vaccine can not cause rabies. But, when put into an animal's immune system, the vaccine will cause the animal to develop antibodies to the rabies virus, thus making the animal immune to the disease. <PERSON> Wistar </PERSON> has applied to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> for approval to conduct the tests. <ORGANIZATION> Wistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, is an independent, non-profit biomedical research laboratory. <PERSON> Repprecht </PERSON> said the islands under consideration for the test are <LOCATION> Parramore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Murphy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on the coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. These islands are uninhabited by humans, but do have a population of raccoons. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> islands are part of a wildlife refuge. He said he hopes that the test can get under way this fall. Rabies is a viral infection that can infect any warm-blooded animal. It attacks the central nervous system and always is fatal unless a vaccine is administered shortly after exposure. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> shows that more than 20,000 humans die annually from rabies and that more than a half million receive post-exposure injections. About 30,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> receive the rabies vaccine annually. The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported rabies in more than 4,000 animals in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> last year, but no human cases developed. Current rabies vaccines must be administered by injection, but <PERSON> Cheston </PERSON> said it is hoped that eventually a genetically-engineered vaccine that can be taken orally will be made, tested and cleared for human use. The oral rabies vaccine now being tested can be used only on animals, he said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says the threat of Soviet germ weapons and not <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public fears about exotic diseases should tip the decision on whether to build a new test laboratory for biological weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has formally renounced possession of any biological weapons or their use but the administration says it still needs a `` defensive research'' program to develop and test protection for American troops. `` We certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protect him and her against those who would use biological weapons,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviets have `` an active research program'' in sciences that could be used for building germ weapons. The Soviets have `` continued to maintain an offensive biological warfare program,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> warned. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> wants to build a $ 5.4 million biological test laboratory at <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Dugway Proving Ground. The plan has been temporarily shelved because of strong local opposition, but <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said the request will be made again next year. Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, who represents the area, said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> plans have been `` setting off alarm bells throughout the scientific community, both internationally and in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, as to the public safety and wisdom of building the Dugway facility.'' The Army wants the lab to be to `` bio-safety level four -LRB- B-4 -RRB-,'' the highest standard of protection. However, all the planned experiments could be done in a B-3 lab, said <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, who explained the higher safety level would be an additional public protection. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> noted the lab would have the capability `` to convert these lethal pathogens into aerosol form'' and that potential was the chief cause of public fears. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> officially closed down its biological weapons program, which was headquartered at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in 1969 and announced that future research would be limited to `` defensive'' purposes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also a party to a 1972 treaty banning biological weapons, but the pact lacks enforcement or verification provisions. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and other officials said repeatedly Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s research program was only defensive and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not use germ weapons and would n't violate the 1972 pact. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said: `` It would be impossible for us to use biological weapons because we do n't have them. ... We would never use biological weapons against anybody.'' But <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said, `` the line between defensive and offensive research would be so hopelessly blurred by the construction of a level-four aerosol facility that the Dugway lab could easily perceived by other nations as a provocative violation'' of the treaty. Other legislators also appeared skeptical. Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said `` the line between offensive and defensive biological agents seems fuzzy at best. Under questioning, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, who oversees the testing program, said there are `` no plans to use genetically engineered material'' at Dugway. Some of the biological agents tested at Dugway are shipped through regular mails, officials said. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, a chief critic of the new lab, said an environmental impact statement on the lab released by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in February dismisses a number of potential problems, including fire, terrorism, sabotage or explosion. He criticized the statement as `` shoddily prepared, grossly inadequate.'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> is president of the private <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION>, which has sued to block construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lab. The witnesses testified at a joint hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs arms control subcommittee, the Interior subcommittee on energy and the environment, and the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on military installations and facilities.

 A new policy of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> is making it easier for investors to find out if their stockbrokers have ever been in trouble. State securities regulators are applauding the move, but say brokers ought to be required to disclose any black marks on their record even if the customer does n't ask. <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will provide information to anyone who requests it in writing from the organization's records on its 6,600 member firms and on 460,000 brokers _ virtually every retail broker in the country. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the over-the-counter stock market, has revealed only the current employer of a broker and any major disciplinary actions brought by the association itself, said <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Enno </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbing </PERSON>. Now, the association, at no charge, will supply information on all infractions, including brokers' criminal convictions and disciplinary actions taken by federal and state agencies and by other stock exchanges, he said. <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> will also list a broker's previous employers so `` you can determine if this guy has been a job hopper,'' Hobbing said. He said expanded records will be supplied only in response to written requests, while the limited information previously provided will continue to be given over the telephone. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents state securities regulators, has been pushing to shift the onus of triggering disclosure from customers to brokers. It is suggesting that brokers be required to give new customers a brochure outlining their disciplinary history as well as the commissions they charge and other information. The new <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> policy `` certainly represents a vast improvment over what was previously available,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION> president and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s top securities regulator. However, he said it was only `` an important first step,'' adding, `` it's really a little unrealistic'' to expect most customers to take the initiative in investigating their broker's record <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said that many investors who called a hotline set up after the October stock market crash complained that their brokers had placed them in unsuitable investments or had engaged in unauthorized trading. A requirement that brokers disclose past violations of that nature may have prevented additional transgressions. Wall Street executives have labeled <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal `` red letter disclosure,'' after <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> <PERSON> Prynne </PERSON>, the adulteress in `` The Scarlet Letter'' who was required in <LOCATION> Puritan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to wear a red letter `` A.'' They argue that if brokers had to reveal their disciplinary history, customers would shun brokers guilty of any offense.

 In the meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> said investors can get a form for requesting information about a broker or securities firm by contacting <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> regional offices or by writing the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Membership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, P.O.

<TEXT>
 A man who hoped to float from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> drifted more than 600 miles during his 20 days in a raft, buoyed by his thoughts of hot cereal and strawberry ice cream while waiting for rescuers. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>, who was rescued Monday, said he survived on rain for drinking water and tiny shrimp, crab and fish from seaweed he plucked from the sea. `` I have a great desire to learn about cultures on the islands, and I like to travel in unusual ways,'' said <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>, who was rescued by a supertanker off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, suffering from second-degree burns and having lost more than 30 pounds. `` I'll be staying on land for a while,'' <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said Tuesday from his hospital bed. `` I wo n't be heading for any islands.'' <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, climbed into a tiny inflatable raft at sunset on April 12 and set out from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. The closest island was <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isaac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 60 miles away. `` I thought I could zig-zag back and forth to get there,'' he said. `` I felt very strongly that it could be done.'' <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said he studied maps and wind and current patterns at a library before leaving. His equipment included oars and oarlocks and another tiny <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> surplus raft that carried food, water and clothes. But <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>, an odd-job laborer, had taken only a few informal sailing lessons in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the tiny raft was too small for his 6-foot-3, 180-pound frame. He had no motor, no radio communications, no signal flares, no water desalination unit and no compass. But he did have a strong personal will. `` Whenever I thought that this could be it, I would say, ` Stop, you ca n't think that way,''' <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said. `` I felt I would make it,'' he said, licking his blistered lips so he could continue talking. <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said he caught high winds, heavy rains and swells that dwarfed and repeatedly overturned his craft. His supply raft deflated on the second day of his voyage and many of his supplies sank. He was burned by the sun and saltwater and suffered abrasions from the raft. The rains provided him with drinking water. `` I held out my raincoat to catch the water, and I'd scoop it up,'' he said. For food, he caught tiny shrimp and crab and fish from seaweed. Once he had a hole in the raft, which he quickly patched. <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said he lost track of time and overcame his fears with two all-consuming visions. `` Strawberry ice cream with Fig Newtons, and Cream of Wheat with cream,'' he said. On Sunday, 650 miles from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and 20 days out, he saw one of the many tankers that had passed him by, and waved the T-shirt he kept handy. Just like the other tankers, this one kept going. `` About 20 minutes later, I looked back, and they had turned,'' he said. `` I said to myself, ` There are no traffic signals out here, tankers do n't just turn. They're coming back.''' Korean crew members aboard the 800-foot Bahamian oil tanker <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchess </PERSON> climbed down a ladder to fetch <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>, who was too weak to stand. <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Burdette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tomlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Monday used a helicopter to bring him ashore. `` If we had known about this ahead of time, it would have been classified as an unsafe voyage and would have been stopped,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said Tuesday from the Cape May Station. `` Sometimes, going through life, you take risks,'' <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON> said. `` You've got to take chances, otherwise you ca n't reach your dreams.''

 Legislation to end all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and impose a near-total embargo on exports and imports is heading for a partisan battle on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave its approval to the disinvestment bill on Tuesday, voting 27-14. Action by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be scheduled soon. The Democratic-controlled committee acted after voting down repeated attempts by Republicans to dilute the measure's impact. The panel also approved by voice vote separate legislation urging and authorizing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to impose economic sanctions against the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> for alleged widespread and serious human rights violations, including the diversion of international starvation relief to the Ethiopian armed forces. Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the panel's African affairs subcommittee, said ending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and imposing a two-way embargo on most trade will not cause <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white minority government to end its apartheid policies of racial separation `` Sanctions will not of themselves bring down apartheid,'' <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said. But he said they will raise the cost to the white minority regime of maintaining <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as `` one vast slave plantation'' in which whites profit from the exploitation of blacks. `` This bill is the only non-violent means at our disposal, the least costly means of averting a terrible tragedy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said. Opponents of the legislation said it will hurt the black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> it is designed to help. They predicted the loss of thousands of jobs not only for blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but also for Americans whose companies are hurt by the impact of the sanctions. `` This is not a policy, this is scorched earth,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., contending the bill will cost 2 million jobs for South African blacks by the year 2000 Supporters of sanctions acknowleged that some American jobs might well be lost but said that is of secondary importance in the battle against apartheid. `` It may well be necessary in the pursuit of vital <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests for us to be prepared to pay a certain price ourselves here at home,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, adding that the bill has been endorsed by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor organizations including the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking against an amendment to enable the president to waive the sanctions law if it is hurting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said such a loophole would tell black South Africans, `` We are only prepared to help you to the extent that it does n't hurt us.'' The bill would replace a sanctions law enacted over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto in 1986. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> contended that the 1986 law has failed to put a dent in apartheid. `` I sympathize with the desperation,'' he said of the new legislation. `` But acts of desperation generally hurt innocent bystanders, and this one does it in spades.'' The 1986 law barred new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and established several specific trade sanctions. But it has permitted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to stay in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if they so choose. The new bill would forbid any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen from holding any investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a requirement that would force the closing or sale of all U.S.-owned companies in the country. It would would bar all imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> except for certain strategic minerals. It would prohibit all exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> except for publications, articles intended to relieve human suffering, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic assistance, and private assistance intended to promote human rights, health, welfare, religious and educational activities. An amendment adopted during the committee debate also provided an exemption for food, a step supporters said would make the legislation more attractive to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members representing farm regions. Prospects for the legislation are considered good in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where majority Democrats see the sanctions issue as a political plus for them in this election year. However, its prospects in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are less clear, in part because the legislation lacks support of moderate Republicans who were the key to passing the more limited sanctions bill two years ago. The sanctions would go into effect six months after the bill was enacted into law. The legislation also: _ Prohibits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the South African petroleum industry _ Bars all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear assistance to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ Directs the president to pursue international agreements aimed at dismantling apartheid _ Requires the president to impose penalties on foreign nationals seeking to take significant commercial advantage of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions _ Adds to the existing conditions for lifting sanctions a requirement that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> implement <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions for the independence of the territory of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> _ Authorizes $ 40 million for economic assistance for disadvantaged South Africans

<HEAD>Another Round Of Talks Ends In Failure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A weeklong round of negotiations over increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and orange sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ended in failure Tuesday night with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> saying it would seek to have <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s import quotas declared illegal under international trading rules. Japanese Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> broke off their talks after meetings that began last Wednesday. It was the second collapse in the negotiations since late March, when a four-year agreement on Japanese beef and citrus import quotas expired. `` Regrettably the final Japanese proposal offered only a modest increase in access'' to the Japanese market, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said later in a press statement. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would again ask <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, at its Wednesday meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to set up a panel to hear <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints `` about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s obstructive beef and citrus import practices. The Japanese government blocked a similar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s April meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and the two countries then went back to the negotiations that ended in failure Tuesday night <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, a member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mamoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet, rejoined the five-day talks Tuesday night as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator in <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s headquarters near the White House. <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a week, missed most of the negotiations earlier Tuesday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been demanding removal of the Japanese import quotas on beef, oranges and orange juice that it accepted in a 1984 accord that expired last month. Japanese beef and citrus producers, who are influential in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal-Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have argued that their livelihood would be threatened by increased imports. In his statement <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> branded the Japanese quotas as `` incompatible with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules.'' He called on the Japanese government to `` live up to its international obligations and agree'' to a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> review of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaint instead of again blocking it. `` It is essential that the Japanese government join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other major trading partners in pursuing and promoting open global trade -- in agriculture as well as industrial goods,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. That responsibility is not met, he said, by the use of `` GATT-inconsistent quotas'' or other barriers. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> offered some concessions on beef but none of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern about citrus fruit `` was addressed to our satisfaction'' said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> target in the prolonged negotiations was `` elimination of the Japanese beef and citrus quotas by a date certain, along with a transparent and comprehensive package which would assure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and citrus producers full access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s market,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> continued, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted an immediate end to what he called `` the GATT-illegal'' requirement that imported orange juice be blended with Japanese domestic juice, and substantial cuts in citrus tariffs. `` The Japanese were willing to make concessions in some areas,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, but in exchange for lifting beef import quotas `` they wanted to substitute other measures that would sustain a high level of import protection.'' This was understood to mean a proposal for surcharges on imports. `` In addition, none of our citrus concerns was addressed to our satisfaction. Under the Japanese proposal, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters and Japanese consumers would continue to bear the cost and burden of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s insistence on constraining agricultural imports,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> will return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Wednesday, aides said. The minister told reporters he regretted very much the failure to reach an agreement. The Japanese side `` was always pursuing realistic and practical solutions to this problem, and we hope the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will in the future be more practical,'' he said. No plans for further talks were announced and <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said this depends on the content and outcome of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> council. He would not say, however, if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will again seek to block formation of a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel on the beef and orange dispute. `` We have to examine <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s attitude on the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not reject outright the Japanese proposal for important surcharges instead of quotas, <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said, and this was not the main obstacle to an agreement.

<HEAD>First Lady Won't Give up Interest in Astrology Despite Uproar</HEAD>

 Disclosures that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife consult astrologers have opened them to taunts from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and criticism from scientists, but the first lady is n't about to drop her longtime interest in stargazing, an aide says. `` She does n't think that there's anything wrong with it. It does n't control policy and it does n't control their lives,'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said Tuesday. White House officials were clearly discomfited by the revelation _ at one moment offering smiles and shrugs for reactions, at others stern denials that serious policy matters have been left to soothsayers. For the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, it was the latest bit of gossip about their private lives to emerge from a recent spate of kiss-and-tell books. Former chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, forced from his job last year after clashing repeatedly with the first lady over the president's schedule, has reportedly written that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted astrologers to help arrange the president's activities The president's reaction to the uproar was quick. `` No policy or decision in my mind has ever been influenced by astrology,'' the president said Tuesday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not deny consulting astrologers, who make forecasts based on the belief that the heavenly bodies form patterns that can reveal a person's character or future. Asked if astrology played a part in shaping his schedule, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quipped, `` You know I'm still looking for the fellas that tell me every day what I'm going to be doing.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, after acknowledging the first couple's interest in astrology, said he believes his own horoscope `` when it says I am destined to meet a beautiful woman and fall madly in love and get rich.'' `` It's all so silly,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said of the barrage of queries that inundated her desk. `` Do n't you read your horoscope?'' In response to reporters' queries, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had an interest in astrology `` for some time,'' and that it was heightened by the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt against her husband. `` She was very concerned for her husband's welfare, and astrology has been a part of her concern in terms of his activities,'' he said. Both he and Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said the first lady had dealt with a friend involved in astrology who `` was helpful to her'' after the attempt on the president's life, but neither would reveal the friend's name. The spokesman said that as far as he knew, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology is limited to reading his horoscope. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted the president has mentioned `` lucky numbers'' in speeches and jokingly has referred to the ghost of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> residing in the White House family quarters. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said the first lady explained that her interest in astrology was due to the shock of the assassination attempt. `` I do n't think anyone realized how frightened I was _ I came close to losing him,'' she quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. Mrs. <PERSON> Cripsen </PERSON> said the first lady `` has talked to this person about his -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s -RRB- safety and travel, but I do n't know of any particular incident or example of schedule change made because of this.'' She contended astrology was `` only an interest'' for the first lady and not a major factor in the Reagans' lives. `` They both feel it's unfortunate and a distraction and hardly relevant to the business of government,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has `` not lost her humor'' now that her secret had been revealed. `` She's laughed about it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. `` She's not upset, because she's not got anything to hide, because there's nothing wrong with it. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> added that she believed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will continue `` to talk to persons who have given her relief for the past few years. ... She's the worrier ... and it's one thing she could use to help her squelch that worry.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he expected the nation's astrologers to make extraordinary claims about their influence on the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, and one _ <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ immediately spoke up. She claimed she had spent a lot of time at the White House and had played a role earlier in the selection of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president. The White House said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> did not know her. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office said, `` We're not aware of anyone hiring this woman. One group of scientists said it was dismayed that the president and his wife have an interest in what they termed `` medieval superstition.'' The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal said dozens of tests in recent years have found `` little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting future events. `` The consultation by political leaders of astrologers has all but disappeared from the modern scene,'' the group added. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was asked what he thought about the Reagans using astrologists. He replied with a grin: `` It's all right with me. I'm glad he consults somebody. `` It's a full moon out there. Now that's what brings the crazies out,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> added. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, poked fun at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from the floor of the House. `` What can we expect from a president who schedules his press conferences and speeches based on the signs of the Zodiac?'' he asked.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Reagans Relying on `Superstition'</HEAD>

 A group of world-famous scientists intent on debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> use `` superstition'' and `` mystical fortune telling'' to make decisions. The practice, said the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, harks back to ancient times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune tellers for advice. `` We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval superstitition,'' the statement said. `` Dozens of tests in recent years by scientists can find little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting future events.'' The statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the book says, also regularly reads his horoscope. The White House later confirmed the Reagans' interest in astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to continue its leadership in scientific research, it is vital that the public have a clear understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience, and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of prognostication,'' the scientists' group said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, chairman of the committee, said he released the statement to counter publicity about astrology following disclosure of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' interest. `` We ask the White House to confirm to what extent astrologers have been advisers of presidents,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said in the statement. `` The public has the right to know who these astrologers are and what recommendations they have made. We ask that their claims and alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny.'' The scientists' committee critically analyzes assertions by astrologers and by persons claiming unusual powers or perceptions. Members include Nobel laureate F.H.C. <PERSON> Crick </PERSON>, two-time Nobel laureate <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gell-Mann </PERSON>, noted psychologist <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, and authors <PERSON> Issac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, an astronomy professor at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the committee, said astrology has been put through vigorous scientific analysis dozens of times and has never been found to have validity. <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said that in one test two scientists examined more than 3,000 predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct less than 10 percent of the time. `` If the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time, that's not the type of guidance we need from the federal government,'' he said Astrologers, said <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, regularly use the positions of the Uranus and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in making predictions, even though those two planets were not even discovered when the concept of astrology was established in ancient times. <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said astrologers claim they make predictions based on the position of planets against a background of star constellations, using methods developed by ancient observers. Yet, he said, the Earth's position has shifted so that constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing positions. `` In effect, all of the constellations have moved,'' said <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>. `` This puts the signs of the Zodiac off by one whole sign.'' The astrology concept that a person's future is shaped through some unexplained mechanism by the position of the stars and planets at the moment of birth also has been attacked scientifically, he said. He said a researcher checked groups of men who re-enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Based on astrology, he said, such a group would be motivated by the same or similar Zodiacal signs. Yet, said <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, `` there was no trend whatsoever.'' The signs were randomly distributed. Another astrology concept is that people are more likely to find happiness with partners who have `` compatible signs.'' The signs, according to astrology, are based on the time and month of birth. <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said a researcher checked 3,500 marriage certificates and found that people are no more likely to pair up with those of `` compatible signs'' than they were with those of any other sign. Some astrologers, said <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, have suggested that the gravitational and tidal effects of distant planets, such as Mars, at the moment of birth can affect a person's future. Calculations by scientists, said <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, show that the obstetrican who delivers a baby has a six times greater gravitational influence on a child than the planet <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The tidal effect of the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion, he said. `` Is this really something on which we want to base our national destiny?'' <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, in his statement, said the committee of scientists was concerned about damage that belief in astrology may cause. `` Scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the public,'' he said. `` Recent opinion polls have shown that up to 52 percent of teenagers accept the validity of astrology. The intrusion of astrology into the highest levels of national security thinking now is a cause for further concern.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he sees `` encouraging signs'' that religious oppression has abated somewhat in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a speech Tuesday devoid of the harsh criticism of recent weeks, the president said <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has admitted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> made mistakes dealing with religious believers in decades past and they would be `` rectified.'' `` What we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continued change, in the spirit of glasnost, when it comes to matters of religion,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a meeting on religious rights at the White House. Glasnost is the Russian term for the Soviet leader's policy of bringing openess to Soviet society. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was scheduled to address the issue of human rights again today in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during a speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to the National Strategy Forum, a non-partisan organization that sponsors educational programs on national security and foreign policy issues. The address is another in a series of scene-setters for the upcoming May 29-June 2 summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In Tuesday's speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said some dissidents have been allowed to emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, some churches have been allowed to open and organize and the printing of 100,000 Bibles will be permitted. `` These are encouraging signs and we welcome them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added, many churches have been denied recognition, religious instruction outside the home is still illegal and the new Bibles will scarcely serve a nation of 280 million. `` So while every positive step taken by the Soviets is welcomed _ we realize that this is just a beginning,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I promise you that the witness of faith you brought here today will not be confined to these four walls or forgotten when this meeting is ended. `` I will carry it in my heart when I travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the end of this month and I will say that the most fitting way to mark the millenium of Christianity in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> ... would be granting the rights of all the peoples and all the creeds of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to worship their god in their own way.'' While noting the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said: `` The rights of Soviet Jews have taken up much of our official time and this is very close to my heart Our hope is for doors to open completely to emigration and to full freedom for all faiths.'' After the conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader he would visit an Orthodox monastery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> despite the church leader's request <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cancel the trip in protest of religious persecution. `` He said he already made plans and he has to go,'' Myroslav Cardinal <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> told reporters. The monastery on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the central building of which is more than 700 years old, is being restored with government financial help. The cardinal said he made the request because Ukrainian Catholics continue to suffer persecution. `` Today, we hear so much about glasnost and perestroika,'' he said. `` But, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have yet to touch the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Our priests are punished or fined for celebrating the liturgy in private homes, and the faithful live in constant fear of imprisonment. Such violations of basic human rights simply must not exist.''

 The mother of ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Wednesday after appealing to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow her son to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> as her dying wish. Dr. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said 95-year-old <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> suffered cardiac arrest at noon -LRB- midnight Tuesday -RRB- and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> had been hospitalized since Sunday suffering from pneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure. She lapsed into a coma late Tuesday, <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON> said. She died as Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> convened her Cabinet's crisis committee to consider a request by Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> to allow her son to return to see her one last time. The request was made in a letter delivered Tuesday to the presidential palace. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> stayed behind in February 1986 when a military-civilian uprising drove her son into exile after 20 years in power and lifted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come back. The former president's supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple the Aquino government. On Tuesday, the military announced that troops had seized 30 rifles and 300 sticks of dynamite during a raid Monday on a suburban machine shop owned by a Marcos supporter. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> had said it was up to civilian authorities to decide whether to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. But he indicated the military command was wary of such a request. `` We will have to assess ... whether conditions in the past are still the same,'' he told reporters on Tuesday. `` We still have certainly a serious threat situation in the country coming from -LRB- communist rebels -RRB-, and we do n't want additional problems.'' Before Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' death, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> told reporters today the decision on allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return would have to be political and not based solely on legal considerations. <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> underwent dialysis Tuesday for her failing kidneys and was running a high fever. He said she was comatose, but she showed stable blood pressure and was `` breathing easier.'' In her letter, Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> said she was near the end of her life. `` My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon my lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my bedside as I say goodbye to all of you,'' said the letter, a copy of which was released by the presidential staff. `` Pray grant me this wish and this privilege as one mother to another.'' The letter, apparently drafted by family members, included the thumb print of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother. In a separate letter, the former president's brother and sister, Dr. <PERSON> Pacifico </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos-Barba </PERSON>, asked Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to `` grant our mother's final wish.'' They were at her bedside when she died. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters held a candlelight vigil and prayed for Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' recovery. Dozens of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters jammed an adjacent hospital room to watch her through a small window. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> came from a wealthy northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> family of Filipino and Chinese extraction. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON>, was a politician and lawyer who died in 1944 during the Japanese occupation. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos-Keon </PERSON>, who died in December 1986.

<HEAD>Chevrolet G-20 Van Shows Great Head-Injury Potential, NHTSA Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A driver is in greater danger of brain injury in the crash of a Chevrolet G-20 van than in any other vehicle tested by the government this year. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday a 35 mph crash test of the G-20 resulted in a head-injury criterion of 3665. The criterion is an index measuring the potential for brain injury. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> van was crashed head-on into a fixed barrier, and the criterion was calculated from recordings made by an instrument-equipped dummy wearing a safety belt. The Chevrolet Astro Van test produced a driver's head-injury criterion of 1603; the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> F-150 pickup, 1074; the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> XE </ORGANIZATION>, 949; and the Chevrolet C-1500 pickup, 892. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year said the <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanagon </ORGANIZATION> produced a head-injury criteron of 1320 on the driver side. The agency also released results showing the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulsar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NX </ORGANIZATION> produced a head-injury criterion of 1134, higher than that of any other 1988 subcompact car tested so far. The agency earlier tested three other 1988 subcompacts. The <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> produced a head-injury criterion of 1114; the <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tercel </ORGANIZATION>, 1005; and the <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corolla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FX </ORGANIZATION>, 593. The tests were conducted at 5 mph faster than the 30 mph required by law. The higher speed produces a crash that is one-third more severe than at the lower speed, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. At 30 mph, 1000 is the highest head-injury criterion permitted. Only one vehicle of a given type is tested, and further testing could produce different results, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Compact cars tested earlier this year showed the Peugeot 505 GLS with a head-injury criterion of 1701; the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> Maxima SE, 907; and the <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Le Mans Aerocoupe, 819. In the large and midsize range, the Mercury Sable produced a head-injury criterion of 712, and the Ford Taurus, 707.

 As thousands take to the woods of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in their annual hunt for morel mushrooms, a company is on its way to stocking grocery store shelves year-round with the elusive delicacy. Morel hunting has become a tradition in the Midwest from April to June, with many communities sponsoring morel festivals _ complete with mushroom queens _ in honor of the fleeting fungus. The fascination with the morel lies not only in its unique flavor, which devotees say is as different from the common button mushroom as its appearance, but in the hunt as well. `` Someone I spoke to once called it morel fishing rather than morel hunting,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boyne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which this weekend is host of the community's 28th-annual morel hunt, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s oldest. One of the most common spots to find the morel is under a dying elm tree, but it also can be found in apple orchards, `` and almost everyone says not to walk past a mound of leaves because there's probably a morel or two underneath,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said The novice simply must keep an eye out for the unique features of the morel, especially its pitted cap resembling a sponge. Morel hunting can be hazardous because of the false morel, which is often more plentiful and conspicuous than true morels. When cooked, the false morel, with a wrinkled cap that looks more like a brain than a sponge, can release a potentially deadly `` Most of the trouble comes in when people start experimenting,'' says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> mycologist. Guidebooks or searching an experienced morel hunter could make the job safer and easier, she advises. A Lansing-based company also hopes to make it easier for morel lovers by enabling them to satisfy their cravings at gourmet shops rather than in the hinterland. <ORGANIZATION> Neogen </ORGANIZATION>, an agricultural biotech company, has found the secret to cultivating the morel indoors. It claimed a patent in 1986 for morel cultivation, and can grow the mushroom indoors 365 days a year by providing the environment that triggers its sex cycle, company Vice President <PERSON> Brinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Plans for commercialization of the domesticated morel are under way, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> predicts morels will be on shelves _ probably only in gourmet shops _ in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> next year. He said licensing agreements for morel production are being negotiated with companies in the Far East and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` There will be production capabilities to make morels available to anyone who wants them,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We'd love to make the morel a favorite at Christmas. Nobody even thinks about having morels now at Christmas.'' Because of the mushroom's short season and the laborious search involed, morels now sell for as much as $ 15 to $ 30 per pound here, and an ounce can cost nearly that much in some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> gourmet shops. Even with indoor cultivation, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> predicts wholesale prices with remain between $ 12 and $ 20 per pound. Despite the increased availability, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he believes morel hunts will continue. `` There are zillions of people who go out and fish for trout, when you can get them year-round at trout farms,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` This is the same thing.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is n't exactly asking <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to quit the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in the wake of repetitive landslides in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. But he's obviously had enough taunts to last for the rest of the nominating season It's pretty tame stuff, especially compared with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign rhetoric, but Democratic leaders already are urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sole remaining rival to tone down his rhetoric in the five weeks left in the primary season _ in hopes of maximizing the chance of defeating Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November. But whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or anyone else can cause <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to back off is an open question. All they really can do without risking offense to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s following is to ask politely, and that does n't exactly make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sound like the strong, effective leader he wants the country to think he is. `` I do n't mind disagreements on issues,'' he said Tuesday night as he celebrated his Midwestern victories while losing the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` I just hope we can both continue to campaign with the respect we've had for each other in the past year.'' For a man who has elevated caution to an art form, that amounts to a blunt statement that he's had enough of observations like this <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> critique of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' style: `` The kitchen is clean and cool. Ai n't nothing cooking.'' That is mild compared with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign, when he complained about party rules and waged a mini-platform fight at the party convention that gave <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> his nomination, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides must realize that. Nonetheless, it's obviously beginning to nettle <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And it probably delights Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the men who are planning his general election campaign as the designated Republican successor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken a few shots of his own at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days. Although aides say his candidacy will be based on the traditional virtues of peace and prosperity, the vice president has already shown he's prepared to meet <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' likely lines of attack head on. Asked about Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his legal difficulties, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could `` go into a guilt-by-association mode'' that involves <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign staff. Asked about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticisms of the administration's handing of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I ca n't wait for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> matter ... One of the beautiful things about being a new candidate without a heck of a lot of experience in foreign affairs is you can make dramatic statements without necessarily having the proof.'' All this is coming at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the same time that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has sharpened his rhetoric in the days following last week's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary defeat Party leaders are already hinting to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that with Tuesday night's landslides, it may be time to give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> some breathing room. `` I would hope he would n't say anything that could be used against <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> in the general election,'' Arkansas Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said after Tuesday's primaries. `` He has at every turn in the road said it's imperative for a Democrat to be elected,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had asked governors to withhold their endorsements until he could prove himself in the primaries. Most Democratic officials are n't interested in any additional debate as they seek to recapture the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and end eight years of Republican rule. After <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s two entrances and exits from the campaign, not to mention <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s political immolation and a long winter of turbulent primary campaigning, they've had all the excitement they want. `` It may be boring but I love it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chair <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> as she surveyed a race that now seems all but tucked away for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnahan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chair, said, `` Where I am personally disappointed is that for so long <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did so well as a coalition builder and bringing people together and then within the last week or so seems to have a reverse type of position and has started attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I find that very disappointing. What he's managing to do is diminish his own stature.'' Under the ordinary rules of politics, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be long gone from the campaign, joining <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and the rest of the also-rans on the sidelines after going six weeks without a primary victory. But the normal rules of politics do n't apply to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and for good reason. He alone of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' past and present rivals has a demonstrable following that numbers in the millions and can make or break a Democratic nominee in the race to succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Democrats Move to Junk Trade Bill's Oil Export Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats seeking to head off a presidential veto of the trade bill or gain enough votes for an override are wooing <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s two senators with a promise to consider more lenient export rules for that state's oil. The move came Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> introduction of a resolution authorizing `` technical corrections'' in the trade bill, which cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 63-36 last week. The margin was three votes shy of what would be needed to override a veto. The `` corrections'' would be made in two provisions opposed by Alaskan oil interests. One of the provisions would approve export of 50,000 barrels a day of Alaskan crude oil to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, but would require the oil to be transported first to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> port in American vessels. The feature is a favorite of politically influential maritime unions and lawmakers from states whose ports could benefit. The other provision would limit exports from new refineries in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to 70,000 barrels and day and half of total production. The House is expected later this week to take up the resolution authorizing changes, with senators likely to act next week when they return from a recess. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, described the resolution as a last-ditch effort to dissuade President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from his threatened veto. `` We're trying to meet him halfway if we can,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. But Republicans immediately scoffed that the real reason was to pick up the two votes from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s senators for an override attempt. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opposition to the trade bill stems in large part to a provision to require all but the smallest companies to provide their employees with 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Democrats have been threatening to make that an issue in fall campaigns. More recently the president has reportedly objected to the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil provisions. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that was one reason the Democrats are attempting to remove them and replace them with funding for a study that would not have any direct impact on exports. `` We're trying in every way to appeal to his better nature,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. But just before <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plan went through the Rules Committee, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., described it as `` a ploy to change some votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in order to override a possible presidential veto. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., took the floor and accused <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of trying to `` win at all costs. `` I am told there is a proposed new rule in the works that will allow the majority to delete the Alaskan oil provisions in a last-ditch attempt to manipulate a veto override in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` Is there nothing left of the integrity of our rules and procedures?'' Despite the maneuvering, one of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> senators, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, has said he will not necessarily back the trade bill even if the export curbs are dropped.

 This innovative <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> town, which once considered building a dome over itself to keep out the harsh <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> winter, is trying to tax neighboring <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> for its noisy use of Winooski's airspace. The western <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> town of about 6,300 people sits at the end of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s runway, and its downtown is just off the airport's main approach. Residents say the noise from helicopters, <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> fighters and jets flying in and out of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s largest city can be unbearable. `` They go right over our building,'' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Levesque </PERSON> said recently. `` It's really an awful thing. They would n't do that to a herd of cows.'' Winooski officials, saying the planes were invading their airspace, decided to tax <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> balked. <PERSON> Winooski </PERSON>, contending that <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> had n't paid the taxes, then filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to collect on a bill of $ 90,000, plus interest. `` By flying that low, they have essentially confiscated the land that is below that air,'' said <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Casavant </PERSON>, a physics professor and former <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> selectman. The airport noise depresses land values, <PERSON> Casavant </PERSON> said. `` Yes, it is unusual ... -LRB- but -RRB- this is not the first time <PERSON> Winooski </PERSON> has set precedent,'' <PERSON> Casavant </PERSON> said. In 1979, a dome to cover the town was proposed to save energy and ward off winter. The proposal was the subject of an international symposium and federal money was requested to study it, but the project never got out of the planning stages. Officials argue that they are n't taxing the planes, but the space they use when they land and take off. `` Property taxes are not novel,'' said <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keleher </PERSON>. `` Property taxes are our business.'' <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> has dismissed the airspace tax, although <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, the city's outspoken Socialist mayor, applauded <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> for its imagination. `` As somebody who is interested in alternatives to the property tax, I have to congratulate our friends in the city of <LOCATION> Winooksi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` It's an interesting concept, but not terribly practical. If <PERSON> Winooski </PERSON> could do it, so could <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. We would be evolved to a toll booth in the sky.'' Landowners have sued over airspace rights in the past, but experts said they can not recall a case where one city sued another to collect taxes for airspace. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellerstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> law professor and tax expert, said he had not seen the suit but called the idea behind it `` bizarre.'' `` It seems to me, it would be as if the state of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were trying to tax the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hellerstein </PERSON> said, explaining that a plane might fly over the <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> state on its way to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` I've never heard of anything like this.'' But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teachout </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royalton </LOCATION>, said the lawsuit is not so far-fetched, even if it presents some practical problems. <PERSON> Teachout </PERSON> said the city faces the difficulty of placing a monetary value on the airspace. Tax values are normally established by properties' market values. `` How do you figure out what that airspace is worth?'' he asked. `` Nobody is going to pay for it.'' The lawsuit also has to draw a boundary on the airspace in question and has to show that <PERSON> Winooski </PERSON>'s situation is different from that of most other communities, where planes overhead fly at greater altitudes, <PERSON> Teachout </PERSON> said. `` That would be the toughest problem _ convincing a court it is n't going to be opening up the floodgates -LRB- to future suits -RRB-.''

 Two teen-agers were in custody Tuesday for allegedly shooting and killing a tax assessor as he walked home from work, while police searched for the killers of two other people shot in unrelated incidents. A 15-year-old suspected gang member and a 17-year-old boy were arrested Monday, minutes after they allegedly fired on the man from a speeding car, police said. Two more teens were arrested Tuesday in another shooting, in which two 15-year-olds were wounded. In <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, a motorist escaped gunfire by driving his car down railroad tracks until it got stuck, then fleeing with a passenger as a freight train smashed into the vehicle. No one was hurt in the Monday morning chase, which police said began as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 20, were driving near <LOCATION> Cherrieville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a frequent site of street gang violence. Their path was blocked by two autos that stopped in front of them, said Officer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Buettner </PERSON>. A third car stopped behind them. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> heard a gunshot, apparently fired from the park, and drove onto the tracks, <PERSON> Buettner </PERSON> said. Several other shots were fired at them by the other cars' occupants, who chased them down the tracks on foot before returning to their cars. The two men continued driving until their car stuck where the tracks merged with another set. They were trying to free the vehicle when the train approached, forcing them to abandon the car, the officer reported. Police said gang members also were believed involved in the fatal drive-by shooting Monday night of <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON>, 18. Officer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruelas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON> was confronted by several suspected gang members as he stood on the sidewalk. In a third shooting, a city waste inspector was killed Monday near Dodger Stadium. <PERSON> Awni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayyis </PERSON>, 58, was killed as he was standing in front of the city's General Services Standards Laboratory. <PERSON> Rayyis </PERSON> provided a description of the killer's vehicle before he died at County-USC Medical Center. In yet another shooting, in suburban <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, police arrested two teen-agers following a drive-by shooting Tuesday afternoon that wounded two ninth-grade boys near a junior high school. The victims were both 15 years old, said Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, a police spokesman, and the two youths who were being held for investigation of attempted murder were 16 and 13 years old. It appears the gunmen were seeking out their victims, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said, adding, `` We have witness accounts that gang slogans were yelled.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a 35-year-old <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assessor clerk was shot as he walked home about 5 p.m. Monday and died a short time later at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Medical Center, authorities said. A police helicopter happened to be in the area and pinpointed the direction of the speeding getaway vehicle, allowing officers in patrol cars to stop the car and arrest the youths, Detective <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. The suspects were not identified because of their ages. The 15-year-old acknowledged gang membership, but the 17-year-old had not claimed or denied any gang affiliation, the detective said. `` Everyday at the same time -LRB- Hunter -RRB- walked down the street, on his way home with his briefcase and a newspaper,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` This could have been anybody in metropolitan <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` This fellow was just walking down the street minding his own business and these young fellows just drive by and shoot him. ... It was just a random thing. The poor guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' Community leaders also asked street gang members to observe a weeklong truce in honor of Mother's Day and <PERSON> Cinco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, the May 5 Mexican holiday. `` I have a message for gang members: Your mothers do n't want to lose you,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivia </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>36 Million New Housing Units to be Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country will need to build or renovate 36 million new housing units over the next 15 years to address the problems faced by Americans living in substandard and overcrowded conditions, a study reported today. The study, prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said that over 6 percent of housing units in urban areas and 17 percent of units in rural areas do n't meet minimum standards set by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The study was financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. The report said 7.7 million households are living in substandard units and another 3.2 million are in overcrowded conditions. Under the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> definition, a home is classified as substandard if it does not have electricity, lacks adequate plumbing or lacks sewage disposal. `` We are reminded daily of the homeless on our streets and shelters. Less visible, but no better off, are those who live in inadequate housing or who pay the majority of their incomes just to stay off these streets,'' <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON>, president of the Realtors association, said in presenting the study. The study estimated that it would cost $ 41 billion over the next 15 years to build or upgrade the 36 million units it estimated would be needed to eliminate substandard housing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The study also estimated it would take an additional $ 56 billion in subsidy payments to insure that households were not paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing. The study said this would break down to an increase of $ 6.5 billion annually over and above current government subsidy efforts. The study did not address the likelihood of getting such additional funds through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at a time of budget constraints imposed by the high federal deficits. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has generally opposed any new housing initiatives and scaled back many of the programs in existence when it came into office in 1981. The Realtors association study is the latest of several recent reports which have looked into the country's housing needs. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issued a report recommending a 12-year program with a goal of providing livable housing for all Americans. The private task force recommended the program begin with an initial appropriation of $ 3 billion to be used as seed money to stimulate state and local efforts to develop and renovate low-income housing.

 The House says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ought to keep at least 20 missile-firing submarines and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s non-nuclear forces should be improved. Both proposals were approved Tuesday on voice votes as non-binding amendments to the Pentagon budget bill now on the floor of the Democratic-controlled chamber. The amendments affect a pair of U.S.-Soviet arms control efforts _ the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talks </ORGANIZATION> aimed at cutting each side's long-range arsenals by 50 percent, and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles Both superpowers have long-range arsenals of submarine-launched missiles, bombers, and land-based missiles, with the submarines considered to the least vulnerable to attack. The START treaty would require major changes and restructuring of those stockpiles. More than half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic nuclear firepower is now contained on 36 missile-firing submarines, which include 28 older Poseidon-class subs and eight Ohio-class subs. Seven more Tridents are under constructions and a 16th is part of the bill on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. While the future composition of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal is undetermined, it should include at least 20 subs, said the amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said the proposal is designed to `` insure that our strategic nuclear submarine force is not jeopardized by the START talks ... we must insure that we have the maximum number of these submarines possible within the overall framework of the triad.'' Also approved on a voice vote was an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., urging President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to upgrade conventional forces in the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is already urging <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to improve its non-nuclear forces, which will assume greater importance in deterring a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact attack when the American-built medium-range nuclear missiles are removed. As it plowed through the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also approved, by close margins, a pair of measures that give federal contractors more leeway in setting pay scales. The first decision, by a 213-195 vote, approved an overhaul of the Davis-Bacon Act. That is a 1931 law which directs that employees covered by contracts on federal jobs worth more than $ 2,000 be paid prevailing local wage rates, a figure set by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The rates are usually those paid union employees. The proposal passed Tuesday raises the threshold figure from $ 2,000 to $ 50,000. Moments later, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 210-204 to reject an amendment that would have raised the Davis-Bacon threshold even higher, to $ 250,000. The law was passed during the Great Depression to assuage fears that construction companies would hire cheap labor. Critics say the measure has been overtaken by events and should be changed, but defenders, including organized labor, call it a linchpin of workers' protection. The votes generally split along party lines, with <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> backing the $ 50,000 threshold and Republicans supporting the $ 250,000 threshold. In other votes Tuesday, the House:

<HEAD>Study Says Some Genetic Engineering Can Occur Without High Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Small field tests of genetically engineered organisms do n't pose much risk to the environment, according to a congressional study released today. `` Although there are enough uncertainties that introductions should be approached with caution, a large body of reassuring data, derived chiefly from agriculture, supports the conclusion that with appropriate regulatory oversight, the field tests planned or probable in the near future are not likely to result in serious ecological problems,'' concluded the review by the Office of Technology Assessment. The study said its conclusions applied to developments likely in the next five years, mostly in agriculture and mostly to organisms produced using the so-called `` recombinant'' techniques for inserting genes of one species into the DNA _ the genetic material _ of another. So far, there have been about two dozen field tests of one kind or another in 12 states and four foreign countries, the study said. These include plants engineered to resist pests, pesticides or diseases; bacteria to confer on plants resistance to frost; and new animal vaccines. Researchers are planning engineered microbes that can concentrate metallic ores and digest toxic wastes. `` It is important to note that modifying organisms for specific human ends is not new,'' the study said. `` Selective breeders of plants and animals have been transferring genes for millennia, often creating forms through centuries of selection that differ from their original stocks more than the forms produced by recombinant DNA methods.'' In agriculture, a new crop strain or rotation probably could ease or control damage, if any, from experiments gone awry, the report said. `` In those rare circumstances of a negative impact on a natural community, the consequence seems most likely to be a transitory disturbance of plant or animal community structure,'' the study said. The worst possibilities appear to be `` to disrupt a fundamental ecosystem process,'' it said. The existence in ecosystems of many species performing the same functions, and the resilience of ecosystems, `` are persuasive arguments against the likelihood of such consequences,'' it said. Regulatory agencies soon should have enough experience to `` sort planned introductions into broad categories for which low, medium or high levels of review are appropriate,'' <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Counter examples can be provided from existing experience to negate almost any proposed category from review,'' but experience is piling up so fast that the agencies might be able to ease requirements in some cases even to the point of exemptions from review, the report said.

<HEAD>US Has Record Trade Deficit With Communist Governments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had a record trade deficit last year with countries ruled by communist governments, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports. Overall trade was also a record, with total exchanges in both directions increasing to $ 13.8 billion from $ 11.7 billion in 1986. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought $ 2.5 billion worth of goods more than it sold, compared with 1.6 billion the previous year. The report, made available this week, details only the second time since 1965 that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had a deficit in trade with these countries. The deficit would have been greater except for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government subsidies on the sale of wheat, a major export to communist nations. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> _ along with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural interests _ all benefited from these subsidies. The Soviets agreed to buy 4 million metric tons, or about 144 million bushels, for delivery before Sept. 30, their first purchases since October 1985. By the end of the year, they had agreed to buy another 4.8 million tons, or about 174 million bushels, for the following crop year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports of wheat to the Soviets were worth $ 389 million in 1987. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidies on these sales varied from $ 19 to $ 40 a ton. They were given to meet competition from other countries, largely in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which also subsidized their exports. The commission, an independent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agency, said that although the Soviets had a good overall grain crop last year, wheat output declined by nearly 15 percent and much of what they produced was not quality wheat. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought 4 million tons. Sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were worth $ 139 million in 1987. The growth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports from communist governments was almost entirely the result of increased buying from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Over a third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> puchases from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were clothes and other textiles for a total value of $ 2.5 billion, up from $ 2.1 billion the year before.

<HEAD>Moving To Limit Establishment Of More Napa Wineries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time, there are high-level moves in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> toward limiting establishment of new wineries in the nation's top wine-producing region. The <ORGANIZATION> Napa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Napa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vintners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> believe the time may have come to put the brakes on winery development in the valley north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Twenty years ago, the valley had 33 wineries; by 1978 the number more than doubled, to 74. Today there are about 200 in the valley, which is only 30 miles long by four miles wide. During those years, a <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> wine beat out the best wines of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> blind tasting, establishing <ORGANIZATION> Napa </ORGANIZATION> wines as world class. Since then, buyers from a dozen countries have been purchasing Napa wineries, and uncounted vineyards up and down the state. Prime Napa producing vineyard land sells for up to $ 42,000 an acre. `` We must preserve this place,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, executive director of the vintners association, representing the most successful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine producers. `` What's at stake is the quality of life here.'' With the growing success of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> wines, land prices rose, but that did n't stop buyers. <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> brewers of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> recently paid more than $ 35,000 an acre to Abbott Vineyards for producing land in the prized <LOCATION> Carneros </LOCATION> area. Another section of producing vineyards went to <ORGANIZATION> Domaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mumm </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for $ 42,000 an acre. Bare land _ it takes four years for a new vine to produce mature grapes _ goes for $ 20,000 - $ 22,000 an acre Still, it's a seller's market. The mark of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is magic. Cabernet sauvignon grapes from the valley can get a 25 percent higher tonnage price than grapes grown elsewhere and which might even be of higher quality. In mid-March, the vintners' association voted to submit a proposal to the county <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> barring further winery construction in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s designated agricultural watershed districts _ 85 percent of the county. The association also wants a winery production zone to `` grandfather'' all the existing wineries in the county. The issue is to go before the commission in mid-June. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, who spoke of a valley whose traditions go back to 1838, said the theory is `` to give legitimacy to the wineries that are here. Anybody who wanted to rezone agricultural preserve land ... would have to jump through some pretty restrictive hoops.'' The action came on a note of alarm. The vintners, some of whose vineyards were planted 125 years ago, had noticed that the <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> over 18 months had received applications for use permits for 40 prospective wineries. Within two weeks a record 27 applications were received for new wineries. `` We usually get only two, maybe three, applications a month,'' planning director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said. `` I think we're reaching the limit, and they -LRB- supervisors -RRB- want to examine the density issue,'' he said. `` That has never come up before. The board wants the department to look into the question, how many wineries -LRB- should be -RRB- in a given geographical area. What would be the criteria?''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was heading West today after celebrating his lock on the Republican presidential nomination as a `` first step, a tremendously important step.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers threw an `` Over The Top'' party for him Tuesday night at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel a few blocks from the White House. The vice president actually secured the 1,139 delegates needed for the nomination a week earlier, in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was making a three-day campaign trip through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Aides said the trip was important to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s effort to position himself for the fall campaign, and to keep his workers energized At Tuesday night's celebration, which came as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled up a trio of primary wins in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, the vice president rejoiced in his success, but told campaign aides and volunteers: `` Now we've got a long way to go.'' A son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had more direct advice: `` Sometimes a son can say things a father ca n't. We want you to go out there and kick some <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and kick him hard.'' The reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner by the younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s off-color remarks to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> longshoremen in 1984 following his debate with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the rally: `` Our dad needs a real job.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said his mathematical lock on the nomination last week `` wrapped this thing up sooner than I think any of us thought might take place.'' `` It all boiled down to working together,'' he said. `` And yet I do n't feel any finality to what has happened now at all.'' The vice president said his lock on the nomination was `` a first step, a tremendously important step'' but he cautioned against complacency. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared to rousing cheers, `` the party is united.'' `` Let <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> go around here talking about pink slips, despair, pessimism in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stats </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` I'll be the guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge.'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> told the gathering: `` Tonight we officially celebrate the fact that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be our nominee following the convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned campaign stops in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> today. On Thursday, he was to visit a high school in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and attend a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> barbecue near <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. On Friday, he campaigns in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. `` I think that the importance of the West is evident,'' said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ... is extraordinarily important to the November outcome. As a result, we have to get out there and begin to build a base of support.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned three separate trips to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other Western states between now and the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. `` We ca n't ignore the West,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` We've got organizations in place and people on the ground that have been working for us.

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KIBBUTZ KFAR SZOLD, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish settlers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s embattled northern border cheered the army's incursion into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but said the operation would provide only temporary relief from <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrilla attacks `` If the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war did n't do the job, this operation certainly wo n't,'' said <PERSON> Moni </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, 34, secretary of this communal farm about two miles south of the border. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> was referring to the 1982 Israeli invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that led to a three-year occupation. Israeli troops on Monday night launched their largest operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in two years, moving north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone'' to search for Arab guerrillas. The incursion followed a week in which Palestinian guerrillas twice penetrated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border, illing two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Five guerrillas also were killed. Since then, residents say, life in northern border settlements has become more tense. `` Fewer people leave their homes at night. They jump at every little sound,'' said <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Or </PERSON>, secretary of <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafna </PERSON>, another communal farm about one mile from the border. Or said his children had taken to playing `` soldiers and guerrillas'' after last week's raids. `` They put rags on their heads and pretended they were guerrillas on a hostage-taking mission,'' he said. When the alert was sounded last week indicating a possible guerrilla infiltration, residents of the communal farms went into a practiced routine they have come to know all too well over the years. Women locked themselves into their small, one-story homes with the children for a nerve-wracking vigil until the guerrillas were caught. The men grabbed weapons they keep in their homes and headed for fences or watchtowers to guard their settlement. Kibbutzniks, as residents are called, have learned important lessons from past guerrilla attacks. They remember vividly the night of Nov. 25, 1987 when a lone Palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider inside the border, made his way to an army post and killed six soldiers before being shot to death. `` During that night, we learned how hard it was for the women in the houses to stay alone without knowing what was going on,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. Since then, he said, the kibbutz has set up a hot line staffed by volunteers and a social worker who people can call when a real alert is on. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> described elaborate exercises held jointly with the army every few months, in which a hostage-taking operation is staged at <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Szold </LOCATION>. `` Every few months the army takes a house, shoots a little bit in the air, then takes a few hostages here,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. He said each kibbutz in the region had prepared for the worst by training a team of Arabic-speaking residents to negotiate with guerrillas, in case a hostage situation developed before the army arrived. In other exercises, kibbutzniks practice storming a guerrilla outpost in an area outside the settlement, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. Similar training exercises have become a part of life in <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION>, a border town of 1,500 overlooking the hills of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Everybody under 65 years of age has a job,'' said <PERSON> Bialik </PERSON> <PERSON> Belski </PERSON>, owner of the town's <LOCATION> Arazim </LOCATION> hotel. He said tasks range from transporting the elderly into shelters to standing guard at the edge of town. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION>'s city council, commended the army's defense of the northern settlements. But he complained the government had not fulfilled its obligations to the town, where `` 50 percent of our problems are security-related.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION> badly needs a medical clinic, because the nearest hospital is an hour's drive away, in the northern town of <LOCATION> Zefat </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION> had been promised more psychologists to help residents deal with fears of attack, but none had been provided. `` The government has made a lot of promises it has n't kept,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` We expect the government to take care of its citizens.'' When the army launched its search operation Monday night, residents in <LOCATION> Kibbutz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Szold </LOCATION> were relieved. `` It can only help if they clean up the place once in a while,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` I hope it will do something.'' Along with sighs of relief came skepticism that the operation would have any long-term impact. `` There will be a deterrent effect for some time, but then ... the guerrilla activity will just increase again,'' Or said. `` There is no alternative to going in after the guerrillas,'' <PERSON> Belski </PERSON> said. `` But they will come back. Every minister in the government knows that.''

<HEAD>Chinese to Get More Beer, Less Pork</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More beer and fewer pork chops are what the future holds for the average Chinese, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> predicts. `` During the 1980s, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s beer production increased more than sevenfold and is expected to have reached 5 billion liters in 1987,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoonover </PERSON>, the agricultural counselor at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` The goal for the current five-year plan likely will be fulfilled in 1988, two years early.'' That figure still allows only a modest gallon or so a year for the average Chinese, because the country's population is now well over 1 billion. A liter is slightly larger than a quart. That gallon average compares with more than 38 gallons a year for the average West German and 24 gallons for each man, woman and child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the latest figures available from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. When it comes to pork _ the main source of meat for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> _ the prospect is for a shortage, <PERSON> Schoonover </PERSON> finds. His brief report is quoted in the May edition of the department's `` Foreign Agriculture.'' It says supplies of pork in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are already short, but gives no figures on consumption. Over 90 percent of Chinese pigs live with only one to three other pigs on small family farms, he calculates. He says it is now being proposed that production be turned over more to larger units that can take advantage of economies of scale. In economies run by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> governments, the small plots permitted to private farmers are generally much more productive than larger state farms. From the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers' viewpoint, what pigs and beer have in common is that both are products of grain, a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export. `` The new policy of concentrating pig production on large state farms, cooperatives and in ` specialized households' is likely to encourage greater imports of feed grains,'' <PERSON> Schoonover </PERSON> wrote. `` Currently, the diets of 90 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hogs are comprised mostly of slop,'' he wrote. He reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s home-grown barley is not up to the standard required by brewers. He says in 1986, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imported 200,000 to 300,000 metric tons of malting barley, with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> the main source of supply. He also implies that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may need to import hops, the other main ingredient of beer. He says the country grows enough hops fr its own needs in most years and even exports some, depending on the weather, but adds it does not have the equipment to prepare and store the crop in surplus years.

<TEXT>
 Republican gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>'s wife says she's tired of seeing her millionaire husband portrayed as a hot-headed `` party animal'' and calls him a `` man's man. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> says her husband is sometimes an impulsive figure who can be aloof but he gets hot under the collar when he's called immature. `` Sure, <PERSON> John </PERSON> loves fast cars and fast boats. When he gets stressed out, that's his release,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said in an interview published in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, we have our best love affairs in the middle of the ocean. There is solitude out there. You're alone. `` The press makes an issue about his cigarette boat and portrays him as a party animal,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said. `` We've always had boats. The cigarette boat is used as much for fishing as racing. We're like a lot of people _ we like to fish. Raese is challenging Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial nomination in next Tuesday's primary. Two years ago, he bucked <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and won the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairmanship, which he resigned earlier this year in a party dispute, and their relationship remains bitter. `` They give <PERSON> John </PERSON> two minutes to speak at most of those Lincoln Day events, then Governor <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> talks for 20 minutes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said. `` He calls <PERSON> John </PERSON> immature and I sit there and watch <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s face get flushed His temper builds and I keep whispering, ` Relax, honey, do n't let him get to you.''' The 38-year-old <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> millionaire owns steel, coal, limestone and media companies. But his wife said he is awkward, shy and searching for a secure family life that eluded him while growing up. `` I have seen him grow tremendously in the 10 years we have been married,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON>, 31. `` I like to mother him. I'll come up behind him and put my arms around him and squeeze tightly. He says he does n't want to be mothered and then his face gets flushed. `` He's a man's man. There is no women's lib in our house. I lean on him. He's the man of our house,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Raese </PERSON> said her husband is running for governor because he wants to `` give something back'' to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I say to him, ` Why do you want this job? Our life was so good before, so easy.' And he says, ` <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>, how many suits can we buy? How many planes can we fly? How many parties can we attend? There must be something more to life than this.'''

<TEXT>
 Democratic voters in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> gave Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> good news on two fronts: broad support as their presidential nominee and a relatively free rein to pick a vice presidential running mate. Overall, `` The signs do n't look bad for November'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he wins the presidential nomination, said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` He does well in the horse race against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` He brings the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats back home. And while he's not winning the black vote, he shows the ability to get it in the general election.'' If there was a downside to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' landslides in Tuesday's primaries, it was that a plurality of his <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> voters had reservations about the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, and sizable shares of voters were unfamiliar with his ideology <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had limited success drawing black voters from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has enjoyed massive black support. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 12 percent of the black vote in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, but only 4 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polls said. Nonetheless, about 60 percent of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he were the nominee against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s exit poll said. A third said they would not vote, but the turnout of black Democrats in past elections indicates otherwise, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. One issue for the Democrats is whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s voters would accept a ticket that did not include him at least as the vice presidential nominee, and the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated many would, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. While 80 percent of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s voters said they wanted him to be the vice presidential nominee if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins, majorities _ 57 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 63 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ said the ultimate choice should be up to the winner. Even greater shares of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> voters, more than 80 percent, said the nomination winner should pick his own running mate rather than being bound to choose the second-place finisher. The finding jibed with high unfavorable ratings of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters. When <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> asked voters if they favored <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> or someone else to run for vice president with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, only about 15 percent of the Democrats in both states chose <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Just over 30 percent took <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and pluralities, about 40 percent, said someone else. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, about 60 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should not be offered the vice presidential nomination, and only as many said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ran with him. Without a running mate specified, 77 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November, with 10 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 9 percent saying they would n't vote, the CBS-Times polls said. Among the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers Tuesday were sizable numbers of Democrats who voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls said. Seventeen percent of the Democrats in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and 16 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> said they backed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984; two-thirds of them in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 81 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> said they would support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November. `` It indicates they're coming home, in one sense,'' said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` Not only does <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win landslide wins in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, but in the numbers he can see some not bad news for November.'' One less positive sign for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in the strength of his support in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where a plurality of his voters, 45 percent, said in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll that they backed him with reservations, to 41 percent who supported him strongly. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, however, 51 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support was strong. Also, while 45 percent of Democrats in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 53 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` just about right'' ideologically as opposed to too liberal or too conservative, considerable numbers _ 34 percent in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and 28 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ said they did n't know `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically,'' said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` A lot of people still do n't have a handle on him, this late in the primary season.'' The polls had margins of sampling error of 3 points.

<HEAD>Dukakis Won't Claim Nomination, But Says He's Now Tough To Beat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> edged a bit closer to laying claim to the Democratic presidential nomination with a pair of landslide primary victories in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Asked Tuesday night whether he thought Democratic rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could take the lead away from him now, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` It's going to be difficult. Even so, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor vowed to campaign aggressively in the remaining primary states. He said he hoped to lock up enough delegates to win the nomination, and to broaden his exposure for a likely fall campaign against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I want people to get to know me more and more and the way to do that is to go out and campaign hard,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending a day at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> today and attending a fund-raiser in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> tonight. Asked if his primary wins on Tuesday night and in recent weeks were a trend that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should take note of, he said: `` I hope so.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored a victory in Tuesday's District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> primary, however. `` I feel great about today and the results today,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has come under increasing criticism from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lately, refused to say whether he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should tone town the rhetoric. `` He's going to have to make that judgment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to try to keep this as positive as I can.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning Thursday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Both states hold primaries next Tuesday. The governor was in a jovial mood following his two primary victories, joking about the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> admission that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sometimes seeks the advice of an astrologist before setting the president's schedule. `` I hope that the nation's decisions beginning in January 1989 will be based on something other than horoscopes,'' he said. Later, he referred to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pending endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the `` astrological endorsement.''

 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnum </PERSON> rescued a girlfriend, got his personal life in order, rejoined the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, confronted <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> over the identity of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>, attended a wedding and gave CBS a much-needed ratings boost. All in two hours. The episode of `` Magnum P.I.'' broadcast Sunday brought the 8-year-old, Hawaiian-based detective show starring <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> to an end. The show was first in last week's <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. It gave <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> its first weekly uncontested claim on first place for the season, after a tie with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for the week ended April 10. Its 32.0 rating was the 14th highest-rated made-for-TV movie ever. By comparison, the first chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Richest Man in the World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis'' came in 37th for the week that ended Sunday and the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome'' finished 57th. It was an especially sweet victory for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which ended the season in last place for its first time in its history. The network was in last place the previous week. Last week's second-highest rated show, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' was more than eight points behind, with 23.6. A rating point measures the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million TV homes. An original episode of `` Murder, She Wrote'' came in fifth and helped <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> win the week. `` It goes to show what a couple of hit shows can do for you,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` They can put you back on top.'' The movie special allowed Magnum to get his personal life in order, find the daughter he thought had been killed and quit his job as head of security for millionaire author <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as a commander. Magnum also confronted <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillerman </PERSON>, over his suspicion that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was really <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> at first admitted that he was Masters. But as the show ended he smirked at fooling Magnum and confessed he had been lying. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was first for the week with a rating of 13.9; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had 13.4 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.1. In the May sweeps, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> took an early lead. The Arbitrons, from April 27 to May 1, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 14.9, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 13.7, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 10.1. The Nielsens, from April 28-May 1, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 15.8, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 13.8, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 9.0. The sweeps are periods in which the audiences of local television stations are measured to set their advertising rates. According to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, last week's top 10 shows were: <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Sunday Movie `` Magnum, P.I.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' CBS' `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Just the 10 of Us,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Little Girl Lost,'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> `` Growing Pains'' special The `` Growing Pains'' special was the opening for the new spring series `` Just the 10 of Us.'' `` Little Girl Lost'' was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-rated movie of the year Three shows on the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> network got better ratings than some of the network shows. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' came in ahead of `` Houston Knights.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` Married With Children'' and `` 21 Jump Street'' came in ahead of `` Max Headroom.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was first among the evening news shows, moving ahead of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> stayed in third place.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored his first primary victory in six weeks in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, telling cheering supporters: `` We're making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better every day.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brushed aside primary losses Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, telling backers he would keep his campaign going until the end of the primary season. `` All the way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>!'' he said at a victory party at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel. `` We keep on winning.'' In final, unofficial returns in the district, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 67,812 votes, or 80.2 percent, compared with 14,969, or 17.7 percent, for Massachussetts Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has suspended his campaign, collected 750 votes, or 0.9 percent. Early returns showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> winning in all but one of the city's eight wards, the predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> 3, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a sizable lead. The city is 67 percent black. As a result of Tuesday's voting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> netted 13 delegates, to three for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Among the Republicans, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who already has a numerical lock on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, got 5,620 votes or 88.8 percent, followed by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with 445 votes, 7 percent; and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with 262 votes, 4.1 percent. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has dropped out of the race, and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> technically remains a candidate although he has only 31 delegate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had n't won a primary since March 20 in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. He had been expected to win by a landslide in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but the voter turnout was disappointingly low. Elections officials said 91,949 voters went to the polls, about 40 percent of those eligible to participate in the primary. In the 1984 primary, 112,412 people voted. Four years ago, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won all but three of the delegates on the primary ballot. The only other primary he won was <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. This year <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has won primary elections in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. He won caucuses in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In other balloting in the district, Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, running unopposed in his party's primary for a 10th term to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, now faces Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> in November's general election. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> also ran unopposed.

<TEXT>
 Illegal aliens who left the country briefly without permission from immigration officials may be eligible for an extension of today's amnesty deadline, a federal judge has ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> on Tuesday declared invalid a rule that made aliens ineligible for legalization if they left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since November 1986. <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> scheduled a Thursday hearing on a motion to force the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to extend the amnesty deadline through the end of November 1988 for those affected. Aliens who were discouraged from applying because of the rule would then have an opportunity to gain citizenship, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abascal </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Rural Legal Assistance. <PERSON> Abascal </PERSON> said late Tuesday that 50,000 to 100,000 illegal aliens could be affected by <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON>'s order, which found the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had failed to carry out the intended meaning of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, said he had not seen the ruling. `` I'm not sure how it will affect us or who will be eligible,'' he said. The Immigration Reform Act granted amnesty to illegal aliens who have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continuously since Jan. 1, 1982. The deadline to apply is midnight tonight. A Nov. 30 deadline has been set for undocumented farm workers who have picked perishable crops for at least 90 days in recent years. <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON>'s ruling was prompted by a lawsuit by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the rural legal assistance organization and other immigrant-rights groups. The suit challenged the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> interpretation of what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meant by the phrase `` brief, casual and innocent'' departures. That phrase was used to describe those brief trips out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by illegal aliens that would not break the continuous residency requirement spelled out in the law. INS regulations interpreted `` brief, casual and innocent'' trips as a departure of not more than 30 days for legitimate emergency or humanitarian purposes. No trips could be made without <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> permission, it said. <PERSON> Abascal </PERSON> said many illegal aliens had gotten terse messages such as, `` ` Your father is dying,' and they run across the border.'' Upon returning, they are afraid they have lost their eligibility for amnesty and fail to apply, he said. Still others were told flatly that they did n't qualify for amnesty. In a separate order issued earlier in the class action lawsuit, <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> said it `` is this court's view that the statute requires a case-by-case determination of whether an absence is ` brief, casual and innocent.''' <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> said Tuesday his order applies to all obviously eligible people who departed and re-entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Nov. 6, 1986 _ the date the immigration reform legislation took effect. In his 24-page ruling, <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend the `` brief, casual and innocent'' absence exceptions to apply only to absences authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, the agency's interpretation Other sections of the reform act, <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> said, `` reflect congressional recognition that the legalization program might fail because of the illegal alien's natural fear'' of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Carson Says `Tonight Show' Will End Reruns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Comedian <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he will write his own material for `` The Tonight Show'' and end its reruns next week because he saw no chance for a quick end to the 2-month-old scriptwriters strike. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he will write his opening monologue and introductions when the show resumes on videotape next Wednesday. No striking writers will be used, he said. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> is not a union member and writing his own material would not be a strike violation. `` The Tonight Show'' went into reruns when the guild struck the motion picture and television industry on March 7. `` We have been negotiating in good faith with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> for the past 10 weeks and it appears we have exhausted every possibility of reeaching an agreement even though countless attempts were made,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` There are numerous ` Tonight Show' staff members, many have been with us for over 20 years, who are in danger of losing their jobs if this strike goes on much longer,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't let that happen I also ca n't turn my back on the ` Tonight Show' audience, who've remained loyal these past 25 years It's time to go back to work.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s company had met with the guild six times since March 23, with the last formal session on April 28. <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s production company, has been rebuffed in efforts to either get a waiver from the guild or reach an independent agreement that would permit his writers to resume work. `` <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was informed one week ago by <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> negotiators that no independent contracts would be ratified until at least 10 percent of the 9,000-plus membership had been offered employment by independent production companies,'' said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hookstratten </PERSON> The attorney said that information came after <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> `` had agreed to almost 100 percent of the union's contract conditions.'' The guild has approved only two independent contracts so far, with the `` New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> Productions, makers of the movie `` Ghostbusters.'' The main issues in the strike are payment for foreign broadcasts and reruns and the writers' degree of creative control they have over their work. There have been no formal negotiations since mediated talks broke off March 10.

<HEAD>Banks To Reopen Next Week For Limited Withdrawals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Banks that closed two months ago following the imposition of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions will open on Monday, but there will be limits on the amount of money customers can withdraw. The announcement was made Tuesday by the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>. The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, most of them foreign. Political instability brought on by the attempts of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and local opposition leaders to oust <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, has crippled the nation's once-bustling economy. `` We are trying to reactivate the economy,'' <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON> said in a television interview. But, to prevent a run on accounts, withdrawal amounts will be restricted as specified by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said it was withdrawing as mediator in the conflict over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> until the civilian government stops criticizing it publicly. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is the power behind the civilian government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25 percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day the government closed the banks. A maximum of $ 10,000 may be withdrawn. Withdrawals of up to $ 50 may be made from savings accounts one month after banks reopen, while payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash availability in each bank. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks. On April 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. But because of limits on withdrawals, about 75 percent of the checks deposited bounced, analysts and business people said. A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed, including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans; transferring funds within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and making foreign exchange transfers. But business people said the operations were largely on paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity and credit. Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67 banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international banking business. Others also closed their doors because of the impact of the crisis. Some banks had closed even earlier, after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> Feb. 26 following the president's attempt to fire the general A statement from the Catholic church on Tuesday accused the government of attacking it and Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>. `` Since the attacks have proliferated in government news media, we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church,'' it said.

 An injured passenger and his wife filed the first lawsuit in connection with last week's accident in which an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliner ripped open at 24,000 feet, killing one person and injuring 61. Tuesday's state <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toyooka </PERSON> alleges that negligence by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> caused Thursday's accident involving a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737. Toyooka of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> was struck by aircraft parts and debris as a result of the rapid depressurization of the airplane and the high speeds of the air flow when a 20-foot section of fuselage popped off, said the lawsuit, which does not specify the amount of damages sought. `` He also experienced prolonged oxygen deprivation, extreme cold and high winds thereby causing him severe and painful injuries to his face, head and other portions of his body as well as shock, great pain of body and mind and permanent injury,'' the lawsuit says. His wife, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toyooka </PERSON>, although not a passenger on Flight 243, suffered mental anguish and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit. <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> issued a statement saying it regreted the legal action, but held no animosity against <PERSON> Toyooka </PERSON>.

Also Tuesday, three surviving flight attendants issued a statement thanking the passengers as `` the unsung heros of our flight.'' `` A lot of attention has been focused on our efforts, and the valiant efforts of the pilots, but we would also like to thank the passengers who helped keep us on the aircraft,'' said the statement by <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato-Tomita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones-Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Honda </PERSON>.

 People who have unsafe sex with AIDS-infected lovers may be more likely to get the deadly disease after drinking a few beers or moderate amounts of other alcoholic beverages, a study suggests. `` Alcohol does affect the immune system. Alcohol makes you more vulnerable to AIDS infection,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON>, who presented the study Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. `` I'm not saying not to drink or not to have sex, only to have safe sex if you're going to have sex. Make sure to use condoms,'' said <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON>, a microbiologist-immunologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and Dentistry of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON> said the study also suggests moderate drinking may speed the development of full-fledged AIDS in people who have been infected but show no symptoms of the disease. Previous research suggests that because alcohol reduces inhibitions, drinking makes people more likely to engage in unsafe sexual activity that can spread the AIDS virus, such as anal intercourse without condoms, <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON> said. He said his study indicates moderate alcohol consumption also may reduce the body's biological resistance to infection by the virus once it gets in the bloodstream. <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> researchers Dr. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Kajdacsy-Balla </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hahnemann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lischner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> based their findings on an experiment using blood from six healthy heterosexual volunteers. The disease-fighting white blood cells were grown with the AIDS virus in laboratory glassware. The blood cells were tested after the volunteers spent one month without drinking alcohol, then 13 to 17 hours after each drank an average of four beers or the equivalent in other drinks. The virus grew 25 to 250 times faster in the white blood cells after the volunteers drank, and each cell contained more viruses. Three to seven hours after the volunteers had no alcohol left in their bodies, their cells still produced smaller amounts of interleukin-2 and soluble immune response suppressor factor, two substances necessary for proper functioning of the disease-fighting immune system. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune system by destroying certain white blood cells and other cells. `` It's a very interesting study and deserves being followed up with -LRB- larger -RRB- clinical and epidemiological studies,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leedom </PERSON>, head of infectious diseases at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and AIDS service director at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-USC Medical Center. <PERSON> Leedom </PERSON> cautioned that the drinkers' blood cells were exposed to higher doses of the AIDS virus in laboratory glassware than they would be inside the body. But he said alcoholics are more prone to infections such as pneumonia and meningitis than other people. And several studies have linked certain cancers to moderate drinking. Other scientists have suggested that drugs and alcohol may be `` co-factors'' required for AIDS infection to occur, and it will be interesting to see if <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON>'s study can be repeated in other laboratories, said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, chief of clinical immunology at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bagasra </PERSON> said he plans to repeat the study in July with up to 200 volunteers. `` People are infected by this virus for years before they get sick. Something tips the balance,'' <PERSON> Leedom </PERSON> said. `` People who drink even moderate amounts of alcohol might make their -LRB- blood cells -RRB- more susceptible not only to virus particles that come in from outside during sexual episodes, but they might be rendering them more susceptible to infection from a neighboring cell that's already infected.

<TEXT>
 A revised United Methodist hymnal includes portrayals of God as a feminine figure and casts mankind out in favor of people, but leaves a few old favorites unchanged. The nation's second-largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination on Tuesday also adopted a new, conservative summary of doctrine that underscores the primacy of Scripture. Delegates to the 9.6 million member denomination's governing conference overwhelmingly adopted the new hymnal that generally shifts to inclusive language for humans, such as using `` All'' for `` men'' and `` people'' for `` mankind.'' But members decided to retain masculine pronouns for God in the book's psalms, denying the request of several delegates to use gender-neutral nouns such as `` God's'' rather than `` His.'' The new hymnbook was extensively updated with nearly half its 625 songs fresh for Methodists _ new compositions, ethnic folk hymns, spirituals and gospel songs, or imports from other denominations. But old favorites and classics of their 18th century, hymn-writing founder, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>, still occupy a prominent place, with `` O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing'' by his brother, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, leading off the hymn section. Work on the book, replacing the old hymnal of 1966, had continued for four years. Delegates approved the new hymnal by 893 to 69. `` An exciting and historical moment,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevins </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, after applause by the 3,000 people. The legislative body, whose 11-day meeeting ends Friday, meets every four years to set the church's course for the next quadrennium. Delegates overwhelmingly supported the new doctrinal summary, which replaces a 1972 version. It was described as reflecting a general swing to conservatism, attempting to stabilize beliefs against counter influences. `` Pluralism,'' or divergency, a hallmark of the previous, more flexible statement of doctrine, has been stricken from the new document. `` It gives us a clearer definition of who we are,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> theologian. `` It puts into sharper relief the marrow of our convictions.'' The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidinger </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wilmore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, executive secretary of an evangelical caucus, Good News, praised the document as providing a firmer doctrinal foundation, replacing a past `` smorgasbord of belief.'' `` The church has suffered 16 years of doctrinal confusion and uncertainty due to theological pluralism, suggesting we might believe just about anything,'' he said. `` That kind of expression does n't attract members.'' However, he said the document leaves `` room for diversity'' around the `` central core of faith.'' Some theologians initially had been sharply critical of the new document, saying it overly elevates Scripture above reason, experience and tradition and tends to curb theological exploration. However, several additions were made to `` clarify our thinking,'' examine `` the nature and purposes of God'' and `` human freedom and responsibility.'' `` The heart of our task,'' the document asserts, `` is to reclaim and renew the distinctive <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> doctrinal heritage, which rightly belongs to our common heritage as Christians.'' Methodists generally are not fundamentalists who consider the Bible literally factual in all matters. However, the new document makes Scripture the primary authority. Tied to it in a subordinate role are the three other strands of the Methodist quadrilateral _ reason, tradition and experience. Theology also is portrayed as subordinate to doctrine, but contributing to it.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s official biographer says the prime minister used an astrologer in a political ploy to get the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to enter World War II by predicting <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would lose the war. <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said the plan in mid-1941, when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was desperate to end American neutrality, did n't work. `` Churchill never used an astrologer personally but he once used one politically,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said Tuesday. The historian has just finished the eighth and final volume of <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s biography. In the summer of 1941, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said, `` a convention of astrologers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dominated by pro-German groups had predicted the victory of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in the war, which was clearly a good reason for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> staying out of it.'' `` Learning of this, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> at once dispatched to the States the astrologer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohl </PERSON> who proved from the same constellation of stars and moons and whatever else astrologers use that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> would, in fact, lose,'' he said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said this brought `` much discomfort to those who claimed otherwise'' but did n't bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into the war. That happened after the Japanese bombed <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, 1941. The White House acknowledged Tuesday that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consults astrological forecasts to help plan President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s activities. The disclosure came after former chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> reportedly wrote in his forthcoming book that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted astrologers to determine the timing of presidential speeches and announcements.

 The government said strikes plaguing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> threaten to derail reforms it initiated to breathe life into a weak economy, claiming that it it grants the demanded pay raises, all Poles stand to lose. `` We have waited very long for this chance and it is important that it not be wasted,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday, echoing a theme repeated constantly in the Communist regime's official media. Since April 25, there have been at least four major strikes and several minor work stoppages. Workers in virtually every sector want pay increases of up to 60 percent to counter price increases of 42 percent in the first quarter of this year that came about from cuts in government subsidies. The more radical strikers want the Solidarity independent trade union movement's legality restored. Since World War II, workers have demanded higher pay in response to higher prices and the government has usually given in _ but sometimes only after violent strikes. This time authorities have met increasing labor unrest with declarations that the old way of labor unrest never really worked and that in any case there is no more money. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s poverty is clearly visible. Horses instead of tractors pull plows, office buildings stand half-finished for years, ordinary items such as toilet paper are in chronic short supply and the average annual income is about $ 1,080. Most hard currency <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> earns goes to service a foreign debt of $ 39 billion, the largest in the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> borrowed heavily from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> during a 1970s boom, providing relative prosperity, but much of the money went for consumption and ill-conceived investments. Good times ended with sharp price increases in 1980, the subsequent labor upheaval in which Solidarity was born, and the martial law crackdown of December 1981 that brought four years of Western economic sanctions. All contributed to a general economic decline. Hoping to spur public involvement, the government held a referendum last year seeking support for its reform plan. It won most of the votes, but not the binding majority Polish law requires to pass such a plan. The reforms, begun Jan. 1, were intended to improve the economy by introducing competition and encouraging more private enterprise. Subsidies on staples were slashed and prices rose to reflect true cost. Officials say strikes threaten to kill the plan. Urban said Tuesday `` the government is determined to protect its program of reforms,'' but the labor trouble `` may put it off or derail it.'' He said the reforms end the government's role as the final source of cash. The government will not make up the difference between what enterprises can afford to pay and what they must pay for labor peace, Urban added. Industry Minister <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilip </PERSON> said on television Monday: `` In terms of the whole country, for surely the whole country would not remain impartial, some 600 billion zlotys -LRB- $ 1.5 billion -RRB- would be demanded in pay raises.'' Despite tough official words, however, managers have found ways to grant raises. Workers at the strikebound <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill were told to expect $ 50 a month more. Strikes by bus drivers in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> and factory workers in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> also were settled with promises of pay raises of at least 50 percent. Solidarity has endorsed the general direction of reforms, but complains about how the changes have been put into effect. It also said true reform requires independent trade unions that can negotiate with authorities. Solidarity was outlawed under martial law and attempts by union activists to have it legally registered in plants across the country have failed in court challenges.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> met with a group of Polish pilgrims that included two Solidarity leaders and said the laws of God dictate that Poles be allowed to govern themselves and decide their own fate. The meeting Tuesday was the pontiff's second in three days with pilgrims from his homeland in which he addressed the strife there. About 500 Poles attended a Mass the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in a chapel of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica on Tuesday. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said that among those at the Mass were Solidarity leaders <PERSON> Kornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>, who were released from a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> prison last week for medical treatment in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Thousands of Poles have gone on strike in the past week in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since the 1981 martial law crackdown on Solidarity, the first independent labor federation in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity has been outlawed since. In a homily carried by <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> radio, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said he prayed that `` the problem of sovereignty, that is, independence, of our country, be rooted most profoundly in another problem, the problem of the sovereignty of society and of the people of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today. `` One can speak of sovereignty, of independence of a nation only when, in the context of this nation, there is a people sovereign and independent who can, by rule and fact, decide their common life,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` Times, historic conditions, situations can change, but these principles always keep their identity: they are simply the laws of God, laws written in the human heart, in the nature of man. <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> radio on Monday carried other remarks by the pope about his homeland.

 Ousted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says he wo n't relinquish the $ 92,000 governor's protocol fund despite a lawsuit the state threatened to file if he did n't do so by late this afternoon State Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> demanded the money, in a strongly worded letter released Tuesday. Asked in an interview if the money would be turned over, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said: `` Nope. Why should it be? It is n't his -LRB- <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s -RRB-. It is n't the state's. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said the money was still `` safely in the bank'' and that he planned to handle it properly, although he would not give details. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> -RRB- would have tried to confiscate it long ago if he thought he could,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, in a letter to former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aides <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, asked them to surrender the money by 5 p.m. today. If they do n't, he said, `` I will direct the commencement of all appropriate actions against each and both of you.'' Gubernatorial spokesman <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON> said Gov. Rose Mofford planned to ask <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> to file a lawsuit if the money is not returned. `` State funds rightfully ought to revert to the state,'' Manager said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial April 4 of misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. During the trial, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aides testified that the protocol fund _ created with receipts from the January 1987 inaugural ball _ totaled $ 92,000 and was being kept in a <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> account. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. The former governor faces a May 19 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. During the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense contended the protocol fund was not state money and that it was loaned to <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> in an effort to get a higher rate of interest for the protocol fund. However, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conviction showed that the senators believed the protocol fund was state money belonging to the governor's office. Mrs. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colter </PERSON> are the official signatories to the protocol bank account. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s letter to them said, `` At the request of Governor Rose Mofford and inasmuch as the monies in the account belong to the Office of the Governor of the State of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, I am writing this letter to demand that you and each of you forthwith surrender and turn over said monies to the Office of the Governor of the State of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would not say if he considered the money to be his personal fund. `` We'll just handle it properly,'' he said. `` That's all I want to say.''

<TEXT>
 Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the government and the rebels began peace talks because both sides had suffered heavy losses. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will resume fighting if the peace talks fail. `` We'll mobilize the entire nation,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said during a wide-ranging interview Tuesday night that also touched upon long-standing rumors of differences between him and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, one of nine commandants in the directorate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, is regarded as one of the most hawkish members of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Since the March 23 signing of a vaguely worded temporary truce, talks aimed at achieving a lasting peace have foundered. The latest round of direct negotiations between the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, took place in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was drawn to the negotiating table because it `` has paid a high cost in blood'' in the war, which has crippled its economy since it began in November 1981. `` But if the Contras were not badly beaten militarily, or held land, they would never negotiate with us,'' he said. The Sandinistas once refused to hold direct talks with the Contras or allow them to come to <LOCATION> Nicargua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> acknowledged the back-pedaling, but emphasized: `` We will never discuss political power'' with the Contras. `` We understand the negotiations with the Contras are indirect -LRB- talks -RRB- with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he added. The Sandinistas maintained for years that any talks to end the war should be with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because it financed the Contras. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> dismissed rumors that the directorate was split between his followers and those of President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` The worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries ... who fight among themselves,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said. `` We all discuss and discuss until we're in agreement. There are certain contradictions. That's natural and helps contribute and move things forward.'' The handling of an ongoing strike has been regarded as an example of differences between <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> and the president. While <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s brother, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, met with Contra leaders in the capital last week, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops detained dozens of people outside a union hall where more than 30 people were on a hunger strike. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> defended the action Tuesday night as a way to restore public order. Two union leaders and three women strike sympathizers were shoved into police vehicles on Tuesday after speaking with reporters a block from the hall. About 40 people have been taken into custody since last week. `` Our police are absolutely anti-repression. They never are abusive, or use torture or murder,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said. Construction workers and car mechanics went on a hunger strike April 25 in support of a wildcat walkout that began Feb. 25 to demand higher wages. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the Sandinistas would give up power if they lost in elections, but said that would be the end of the Nicaraguan revolution. `` And this is impossible, nothing can kill the revolution,'' he added. The Marxist-led Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 uprising that ended the dictatorship of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> promised a better life, social programs and equality to the more than 3 million Nicaraguans. The government now says many of its projects were lost in the war. `` We've paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty and dignity,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said, noting that projects to improve education and health fell short of projections and that there were food shortages. He blamed the problems in part on the war and `` the errors we committed.'' Asked if the government was Marxist-Leninist, <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the teachings of those two thinkers was `` a universal science and anyone who does n't study it is either mentally retarded or ignorant.'' He said Marxist-Leninist theory `` was an important guide in our decisions.'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> praised the Sandinista relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which provides most of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s aid. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` helps us and respects us and we appreciate it.''

<TEXT>
 A jury deliberating the nation's first death-by-product-tampering case is trying to decide if a woman killed her husband and a stranger with poisoned painkillers to escape an unhappy marriage and collect insurance. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury today was to begin its second day of deliberations in the trial of <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> is charged with two counts of causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce and three counts of tampering. If convicted, she could face life in prison. She was accused in the June 1986 death of her 52-year-old husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, and of Sue <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, also of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, who died two weeks later. Both victims swallowed cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules. The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its capsuled non-prescription medicines. Prosecutors portrayed Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> as an unhappy wife beset by financial problems who poisoned her husband to collect $ 176,000 from his life insurance policies. They contended Ms. Snow as an innocent stranger. The prosecution said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> put tampered painkillers on shelves of local stores to make her husband's death appear random and to lead doctors, who had concluded <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> died of emphysema, to the true cause of his death. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s attorney has defended her as the victim of a daughter who lied when she said her mother had asked how much cocaine would cause an overdose and where to hire a hit man to end the marriage. Only Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had the motive, opportunity and ability to commit the crimes, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> told the jury in closing arguments Monday. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> countered that the government's case was built on the testimony of one unreliable witness, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> `` Without <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s testimony, the government case collapses like a house of cards,'' <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said. `` Where's one person other than <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> willing to stand up and say: ` It's <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>! `` <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> is not telling the truth,'' he told jurors during his closing argument. Court documents indicate the major break in the tampering case came when Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> came forward with her account in December 1986, a year before her mother was arrested. Jurors were told last week of a $ 300 $ 060 award offered by pharmaceutical companies to anyone who provided information leading to the arrest of the tamperer or tamperers. Ms. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> said in closing arguments that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s plan failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules, greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted bottles of painkillers found. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> stood to receive $ 71,000 if her husband, a state employee, died of emphysema, as pathologists first concluded, but she could have gotten $ 176,000 if the death was ruled accidental, the prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Chastises Mayor But Recommends No Charges in MOVE Siege</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special grand jury blasted Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> and his top aides for `` morally reprehensible behavior'' in the 1985 MOVE bombing that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 homes, but did n't recommend indictments. The panel, which released its findings Tuesday, called the failed eviction effort May 13, 1985, `` this city's greatest tragedy.'' It ended in a fiery siege with the police bombing of a barricaded west <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> row house occupied by members of the radical group MOVE. Criticism of the 279-page grand jury report was swift. A special commission <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> formed after the confrontation found the mayor `` grossly negligent.'' Members of that commission, which released its findings in March 1986, were outraged at the findings of the county grand jury. `` I'm totally speechless,'' said commission member <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>. `` We know 11 people died on May 13. How can they say no one should be penalized for it? ... To me, I do n't see this as justice.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said the panel spent nearly two years and $ 250,000 in its investigation and voted 16-4 against filing charges. The father of a then-13-year-old boy, one of the two survivors from the MOVE compound, said he was confused and dismayed by the report. `` What the grand jury came up with made no sense,'' said <PERSON> Andino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, father of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who was known as <PERSON> Birdie </PERSON> <PERSON> Africa </PERSON>. `` There has to be some responsibility. ... Justice is blind, but in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> it appears to be very ignorant.'' The grand jury rejected the boy's contention that police gunfire had kept some people from fleeing the MOVE house while it burned. Those killed were inside the house. The jury said it considered but discarded charges of conspiracy, murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, arson, causing or risking a catastrophe, failure to prevent a castastrope, criminal mischief and perjury. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said after the grand jury released its report that he had learned much from the tragedy. `` We are a stronger government, a stronger city,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said, noting the event was the most fully investigated in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> history. `` I am committed to make sure that such tragic events never occur again.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> declined to discuss details of the report or the events of the siege. `` It has been my belief all along that I had not done anything that is criminal and I am satisfied that the district attorney concluded the same thing,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. The grand jury contested <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>'s statements that he ordered officials at the scene to put out the fire shortly before 6 p.m., saying evidence showed that his call came no earlier than 6:25 p.m. `` While the conduct of city officials in handling MOVE is entirely unacceptable, it is not the proper subject of criminal prosecutions,'' the report concluded. `` This city's greatest tragedy ... is an epic of governmental incompetence. It details an operation marked by political cowardice in its inception, inexperience in its planning, and ineptitude in its execution. `` We do not exonerate the men responsible for this disaster. Rather than a vindication of those officials, this report should stand as a permanent record of their morally reprehensible behavior -LRB- and -RRB- the terrible cost of their misjudgments.'' A federal grand jury is investigating whether the civil rights of the 11 victims, five of them children, were violated by the bombing and fire that followed. Its report is expected by the summer.

 This time, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived at the strikebound Lenin shipyard in a chauffeured car and was greeted as an elder statesman with cheers and chants of `` Solidarity'' and `` Lech, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>.'' Eight years ago, as a little known labor agitator, he had to vault the shipyard fence to take charge of a workers' revolt that eventually led to the founding of the Solidarity labor federation and brought down a government. `` I am not your leader. I'm tired,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, 44, told the striking shipyard workers on Tuesday. `` You need a new <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, many more new Walesas.'' Much has changed since Solidarity was recognized by the government in accords signed in this <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port that ended the 1980 strike wave. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has put on some weight, he won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize and Solidarity was banned after a December 1981 martial law crackdown. But his trademark moustache remains and he still works as an electrician at the shipyard. Since 1980, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has taken on bodyguards and a driver as part of his entourage. Fame has complicated his life, making it busier and making him the subject of an occasional death threat. When he attends a union meeting or travels to see visiting foreign dignitaries, he more likely will be driven than drive himself. Old people, women and children pressed to shake <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s hand as he stepped out of the car and walked up to the shipyard gate, which was decorated with Solidarity banners, pictures of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, yellow flowers and a sign proclaiming `` Occupation Strike.'' The strikers shouted his name and patted him on the back as he approached a makeshift podium to deliver a speech. Policemen patrolled nearby, but did not intervene. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the strikers that he was n't their leader. `` I've done what I had to do,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told them. `` But I do n't want a past I only want bread, calm and peace for us all. I want to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> enter a road of reforms.'' The strikers wore Solidarity badges and armbands on their blue overalls. Many also wore yellow hardhats as they sipped tea and smoked in the balmy sunshine. Dozens of strikers crowded the rooftops of nearby buildings to listen to the speech. Outside the plant, people pressed together to catch a glimpse while others climbed on the iron shipyard gate. They joined in occasional `` Solidarity'' chants and chatted with the strikers, some of whom guarded the entrances to the shipyard and checked the plastic identity cards of yard workers going in or out. Over a loudspeaker, an announcer read names of workers whose relatives had come to the gate to bring them food and cigarettes. Cheers arose when workers and sympathizers delivered loaves of bread, cans of sardines and jars of honey and jam in large canvas bags and wheeelbarrows. Just outside the gate, a red-and-white Polish flag with the Solidarity logo was placed near the three tall, concrete crosses joined by three anchors. The monument honors scores of <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> workers, including at least 27 in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, killed during the harsh goverment response to riots against price increases introduced just before Christmas 1970. The monument was dedicated Dec. 16, 1980, fulfilling a pledge made by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> during the early days of the 1980 Solidarity strike.

<HEAD>Doctors Perform Follow-Up Operation On Separated Siamese Twin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Doctors today performed follow-up surgery on a 17-month-old girl who had just been separated from her Siamese twin sister in an intricate 7 -LCB- - hour procedure, hospital officials said <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, who had been joined at the head, were separated Tuesday by a 40-person medical team at <LOCATION> Baragwanath </LOCATION>, the main hospital in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Mphonyana, the smaller and weaker of the two, began bleeding from the incision in her head early today and required additional surgery, the hospital said. Following the operation, she was returned to the intensive care unit. Both girls were in critical but stable condition, the hospital said. `` I always knew they would be all right,'' said <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, mother of the girls. `` I feel so happy.'' In September, doctors at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> separated West German Siamese twins joined at the head. The two boys, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, survived and were released in March, but they reportedly are suffering some physical and mental problems. The <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> doctors advised the <LOCATION> Baragwanath </LOCATION> doctors before Tuesday's operation and called to offer congratulations following the successful surgery. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipschitz </PERSON>, head of the operating team, said before the operation that the chances for success were not good. He performed two operations on the girls last October in preparation for Tuesday's procedure. The girls shared a major blood vessel in their heads, which doctors partially clamped in the earlier operations in the hope that lesser blood vessels would take over the functions of the shared vein. Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, an unmarried, 33-year-old domestic worker who earns about $ 60 a month, gave birth to the twins Dec. 7, 1986. She said initially that she was so horrified that she refused to see the girls for three days. `` Once persuaded to see them, I immediately accepted and loved my little gifts from God,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> said. The girls had a combined weight of 33 pounds before the operation. <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> appears to be developing normally and recently began to speak, while <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced, hospital officials said. Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> was asked to make a five-dollar contribution to the costs of the operations, estimated at $ 700,000. The costs are being covered by the hospital and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> medical school. The Sowetan, a daily newspaper that covers the black township, has set up a trust fund for the twins that has raised $ 26,000.

 Plans to require random drug testing of government employees are meeting strong opposition from a group of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, who plan a legal challenge to the new program. The drug testing would be required for government employees ranging from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> down to secretaries and butlers under plans unveiled Tuesday by 42 federal agencies. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> forwarded employee drug-testing plans from the agencies to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, technically clearing the way for the agencies to begin testing the workers they have designated. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, said he has met with a number of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers who feel the program is `` much more expansive'' than had been anticipated. `` Our contention is that they can not do mandatory, random drug-testing without some probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion,'' he said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said in the past there is no drug problem at the department. As a practical matter, many of the various testing plans already have been blocked by court suits. Other federal employee organizations have said they also will sue once their agencies' attempts to implement testing At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the plan would affect 370 employees, including <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, secretaries, butlers, ushers, chefs, maids, receptionists and tradesmen in the presidential residence. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogut </PERSON>, director of personnel for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said about 1,200 of the 1,600 people working in 13 separate agencies under the executive office of the president will be affected. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not be required to submit to random testing. However, they have voluntarily given specimens in the past, <PERSON> Kogut </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kogut </PERSON> said the 100 percent coverage figure also applies to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff, the office of the vice president, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> and its staff, the Office of Policy Development, office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> and Technology Policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> had certified drug-testing plans that could ultimately cover about 20 percent of its civilian work force _ or more than 200,000 federal workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> already has begun testing some of its civilian employees. The mandatory, random drug testing at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> covers some 4,700 employees in the attorney general's office, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices nationwide and in the six divisions of the department: criminal, civil, antitrust, tax, lands and civil rights. About 7 percent of the 4,700 would be tested annually under the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan, which will go into effect in several months. In addition, there are 9,300 other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who could be tested if there was reasonable suspicion to suspect they were using drugs. Applicants for those posts also would face drug tests. Separate drug testing programs already are under way or are about to begin for certain employees at four <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agencies: the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> guidelines _ regarding clinical urine collection procedures and testing laboratory accuracy _ were first issued more than a year ago and formally published in final form in the Federal Register last month. The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>'s own internal plan calls for testing for marijuana and cocaine. It says 8,661 of the agency's approximately 130,000 employees are liable for testing and that it envisions testing 10 percent of the 8,661 in any given year.

<HEAD>Tiny Device Could Help Heart Attack Victims Survive, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A pencil-shaped pump implanted for the first time to save a heart transplant recipient's life will become a common emergency treatment for heart attack victims, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> surgeon predicts. The temporary device, smaller than a penny, is known as the Nimbus HEMOPUMP. It will be tested for 18 months and requires the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, officials say. `` I must say it's the most remarkable thing I've seen or experienced,'' Dr. O.H. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, director of the institute's <ORGANIZATION> Cullen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiovascular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` A device this small to take over the function of the human heart is really incredible.'' In its first human application, the device was inserted April 26 into the heart of a 62-year-old <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> man. The patient, whose name was undisclosed, underwent a heart transplant earlier but was suffering from rejection and faced certain death, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` He's in the game,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` He was out of the game Monday a week ago, totally out, and the only reason he's in it is because of the device. I say that with absolute certainty.'' The pump is inserted through the femoral artery in the leg and is passed with a tube until it gets to the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber. The tube stays in and is hooked to the outside power source. There, spinning at 25,000 revolutions per minute, it can provide 100 percent of the blood flow to the body and enable the heart muscle to rest and heal. `` The main thing is all other devices require the chest to be open ... major surgery,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` This is placed in a simple incision.'' Unlike an intra-aortic balloon pump now used to treat heart patients, the HEMOPUMP does not require a beating heart to function effectively, doctors said. The device has been in testing for two years and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is allowing testing at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for four patients. A second patient given the pump last week died, although <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said that patient suffered from complications unrelated to the pump. `` We think this is a major important adjunct to treatment of patients otherwise dying of heart failure,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said, adding that he was skeptical of its success when he first saw it two years ago. But he predicted that once testing is completed and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> authorizes its use, it will be a common operation for emergency rooms receiving heart attack victims. `` For heart failure, this is going to be the treatment of choice,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` It's easily introduced and can be used in any hospital that performs open-heart surgery. I think it has far-reaching implications in the treatment of these patients with acute heart failure.'' Besides the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, officials said <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, have <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> permission to test the pump in humans.

<HEAD>Green Line Mortar Duel, Christian Militia On Alert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christian and Moslem militiamen today exchanged mortar fire across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line. No casualties were reported. The two-hour battle in downtown <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> came amid reports of growing tension between a Christian militia and the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army. There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between civil war antagonists in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in two weeks. The clashes have strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975. The fighting coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian heartland north of the capital. Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over the Christian sector of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and along the main coastal highway running north from the city, witnesses reported. Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between the militia and the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army, which is controlled by Christian officers. The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army. The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, has been quoted by several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers recently as saying the military could finish off the militia any time it wanted. Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> commander to become the next president of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expires in September. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has not denied the statements, has not offically proclaimed his candidacy.

<HEAD>Soviet Media Paint Somber Picture Of Polish Strikes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet media painted a somber picture of the industrial strikes now under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, saying the labor unrest is a menace to economic reforms being pursued by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda today accused `` anti-Polish centers'' in the West and an `` internal opposition'' in the Moscow-aligned country of trying to exploit the discontent for their own ends. Pravda said the airwaves were filled with broadcasts from Western radio stations urging the Poles `` to enlarge the scale of the protest'' and to increase their demands. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the strikes in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, Wroclaw and other areas of the country are harmful to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy. But it also quote a Polish government spokesman as saying the strikes did not threaten the government and it gave a veiled reminder that the regime in place enjoys Soviet backing. `` The strikes that are held now and that are sought to be organized do not threaten the socialist state as it has durable internal and external foundations, `` spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> was quoted as saying in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` But strikes threaten the economic reform,'' Urban continued. `` They can put off or undermine it. And the reform is our national opportunity to overcome the difficulties of life and economic stagnation.'' An estimated 7,000 workers were on strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and work stoppages also had spread to at least two other industrial facilities. Workers are demanding higher wages to offset government-imposed price increases on food and consumer goods. Government officials say the price increases were needed to balance goods with the money supply. `` The heightening of tension, endless demands and the staging of strikes can only hamper the processes of democratization and reforms,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Urban as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Urban claimed the latest round of strikes is dissimilar to the labor crisis which began in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the early 80s. Bad leadership was partially responsible for that crisis, he said. `` Now the strikes have broken out at the very start of the process of transition to radical reforms, in a situation when there is no need to stop work in order to speak out loud and be heard,'' Urban said. `` The strikes are groundless and harmful both from the political and economic viewpoints.'' Pravda, apparently referring to martial law, said Solidarity had `` played on feelings of Poles'' and `` what came of this is known to everyone.'' Solidarity was the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, but was outlawed after martial law was declared in December 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Minister of Industry <PERSON> Erzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilip </PERSON> has rejected demands for wage increases, saying the pay increases would `` contradict the second stage of reform.''

 The mother of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died today but President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the exiled president will not be allowed to return for the funeral because he remains a threat to national security. In <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> issued a statement saying he was shocked at the death of his 95-year-old mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said he will keep trying to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` but wo n't violate any laws to go back.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in his statement that he would `` exhaust all possibilities that may be available to us to return to our motherland, to help save her from the threatened communist takeover or a possible civil war.'' Before Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> died, Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to come home. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> cited Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s previous claims that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> followers no longer posed a threat to her government. Dr. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> suffered cardiac arrest at noon -LRB- midnight Tuesday EDT -RRB- and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. In a nationally televised address, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> expressed condolences to the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family, but added: `` After careful assessment in consultation with the leadership of both chambers of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> committee, I regret that considerations of national welfare, which are above the individual interest, forbid us from allowing the former president to return.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said respect for parents was an important value in Filipino society. But she added: `` There are other values involving national stability and the common good of our people, whose primacy I am duty-bound to uphold.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos-Keon </PERSON>, who died in December 1986. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Recto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyer in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, said the decision went against <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> ethics. `` We have a government of neo-barbarians,'' <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> said. `` They act like they've never had mothers.'' Hundreds of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters gathered outside the hospital where Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> died. Many of them wept, while others shouted anti-Aquino slogans and called for a revolution. In <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>, home province of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family, flags were lowered to half staff and masses were said. Before Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> died today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members to consider a request Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> made Tuesday to allow her son to return for a final visit. The meeting ended after receiving news of her death. The request was made in a letter delivered to the presidential palace. `` It was a very difficult but very serious decision,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> adviser <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON>, who attended the meeting. `` We might summarize it in terms of what is best for the common good at this time, what is best for national stability at this time.'' Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos-Shahani </PERSON>, a distant cousin of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and sister of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was `` still a political force to be reckoned with.'' Six senators, including opposition leader Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, issued a joint statement supporting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return on humanitarian grounds. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to several coup attempts. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told air force cadets on Monday that the threat from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters had been neutralized. But police said today that they seized more than 40 rifles, 300 sticks of dynamite and hundreds of rounds of ammunition during two raids this week on buildings owned by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> stayed behind in 1986 when a military-civilian uprising drove her son into exile after 20 years in power and lifted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized Sunday with pneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure. She lapsed into a coma late Tuesday, <PERSON> Brillantes </PERSON> said. In her letter to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> said: `` My dying wish, the one thing that will put a smile upon my lips when I leave this world, is to see my Ferdinand by my bedside as I say goodbye to all of you. Pray grant me this wish and this privilege as one mother to another.'' The letter, which was released by the palace, was apparently drafted by family members and included the thumb print of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> came from a wealthy northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> family of Filipino and Chinese extraction. She was born Feb. 14, 1893 in the northern town of <LOCATION> Sarrat </LOCATION>, which was also <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' birthplace. She earned a master's degree in English literature from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> and taught school for 42 years. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON>, was a politician and lawyer who died in 1944 during the Japanese occupation.

 A top security official predicted today that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will not try to sabotage the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and said massive security would deter any possible terrorist attack. <PERSON> Yook </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan-sik </PERSON>, head of the Olympic Security Coordination and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would be condemned and isolated by the entire world if it tried to disrupt the Games that open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sept. 17. `` There will be no provocation from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' he told a news conference. The optimistic assessment contrasted with past warnings by top <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government and security officials that the communist north might use terrorism to disrupt the Olympics. International condemnation of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for past terrorist attacks and the participation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other communist nations in the Games would restrain the north, <PERSON> Yook </PERSON> said. `` I'm confident <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will never try to cause any problems during the Games,'' he said. But the former army general said no chances would be taken and a huge security force would guard the Olympics. South Korean military and security forces will mount the biggest security operation ever seen in Olympic history, <PERSON> Yook </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure the Olympics will be staged perfectly,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has been demanding to co-host the Olympics, was widely blamed for the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean jetliner en route to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that killed all 115 people aboard. The two Koreas are bitter rivals and have clashed frequently since the Korean War ended in 1953. <PERSON> Yook </PERSON> said he had no firm indications international terrorists have targeted the Olympics, adding that he was confident the extraordinary security measures would defeat any terrorist threat. South Korean authorities are working with intelligence agencies around the world to keep track of about 6,000 international terrorists who might pose a threat to the Olympics, he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that landed at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s airport with just one of its four engines working took off today for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with no passengers aboard, an airline spokesman said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leu </PERSON> said a team of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> engineers sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> inspected the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 thoroughly and `` found no defects in the aircraft and deemed the aircraft airworthy.''

The jetliner, en route to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was flying at 39,000 feet with 258 people aboard one hour and 15 minutes from its destination when the first engine lost power, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. Half an hour later, a second engine shut down and shortly before landing, a third engine lost power. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320,000 pounds and burns about 23,500 pounds of fuel per hour while cruising with all four engines operating, according to the manufacturer. According to a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> newspaper, the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and that the No. 3 engine was also malfunctioning. Leu declined to comment on the cause of the engine failure, saying it was still under investigation.

<TEXT>
 A pipe bomb blew out the door of an art museum that has been criticized in the Cuban community over the handling of works by artists considered pro-Castro, but there were no injuries, police said. `` It's a barbaric act to bomb a cultural center like the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> museum,'' museum vice president <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> said, adding that the bombing Tuesday was an attempt to intimidate directors of the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture. `` This is what happens when demagoguery reigns in this city,'' he said. Police said they were unsure whether the pipe bomb was connected to the controversy, but the bombing occurred about an hour after directors met to discuss a controversial exhibit planned for later this month. `` We have only that a pipe bomb was thrown through one of the Cuban museum windows by somebody on foot or in a car,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villorin </PERSON> said. Damage was limited to the glass door and a section of plaster wall inside the museum. The museum flap began when <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> included works by artists considered sympathetic to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government in an April 22 auction. <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> was the target of numerous threatening phone calls and was asked by other museum officials to resign but he refused.

 A Syrian businessman who has undertaken several mediation missions for the release of French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was expelled from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomatic and French government sources said. They said Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> used a special administrative procedure that does not require judicial approval to expel <PERSON> Omran </PERSON> <PERSON> Adham </PERSON>, who is said to be close to President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. In an interview today with <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> neither confirmed nor denied the expulsion, but said: `` We can not accept anyone of foreign nationality in our territory who, by his actions, hampers the efforts of the French government and risks causing harm to those who are being held hostage.'' <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adham </PERSON> had not served as an `` intermediary for the French government since March 1986'' in negotiations aimed at freeing French hostages. <PERSON> Adham </PERSON> left <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Tuesday by plane for another <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital after the expulsion order was signed by <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, the sources said. He has a Syrian diplomatic passport but is not on the official diplomatic list issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Adham </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for 11 years and his wife and four children are French. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, who is close to Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, was annoyed by <PERSON> Adham </PERSON>'s statements to the media about an imminent release of French hostages just before the first round of presidential elections on April 24 A close aide to <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiani </PERSON>, made several trips to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the weeks before athe voting to try to obtain the release of the hostages, who are being held by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad. The French hostages are two diplomats, <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, 45, and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, 62, and journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, 44. Islamic Jihad has claimed it killed a fourth French hostage, but his body has not been found. French press reports said release of the hostages before the April 24 voting was imminent. They said <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>'s efforts to free them were designed to boost <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s chances in the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> did not do as well as expected in the first round of voting and now faces President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in a runoff ballot Sunday.

<HEAD>Security Under Scrutiny After Lottery Forgery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery officials are reviewing security measures in the wake of an insider scam that almost allowed two men to get away with a $ 15.2 million jackpot. Lottery officials revealed Tuesday that a ticket turned in last week for the jackpot was bogus and an employee at the company that runs the lottery computer had been charged, along with a man who claimed the prize. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> ordered a suspension of the contract extension for <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` until the commonwealth is totally satisfied that all reasonable safeguards against fraud have been built into the security system.'' One of the two men charged in the case, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, worked for <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> as a troubleshooter for the lottery's mainframe computer State Attorney General <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> alleged <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> used a Control Data computer to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a copy of the winning ticket from the July 15 Super 7 drawing. Also charged was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>, who claimed the prize last Thursday. Both men were arraigned on charges of theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, criminal conspiracy and forgery, and were held in the <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> also was charged with unlawful use of a computer and tampering with public information. If convicted, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> could be jailed for up to 31 years and fined $ 70,000, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> could face 40 years in prison and $ 90,000 in fines. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said officials have no evidence of anyone else participating in the scam or of any other bogus tickets in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> also had access to the lottery computer. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON>, the lottery's executive director, said the scam was discovered last Thursday, shortly after <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> received the first $ 469,989 installment of the prize. When <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> claimed the jackpot, he said he had been using the ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeing a newspaper story about the unclaimed prize. But the bogus ticket was printed on a blank from a <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> outlet, while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The holder of the ticket bought in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has never come forward. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the firm had been told by the state <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to comment, although Revenue officials said no such order had been given. A previous insider incident occured in the April 24, 1980, drawing of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Daily Number. The drawing was fixed by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits. The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, also resulted in tighter security for the televised drawings as well as the convictions of six participants.

 Ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said he would continue to seek permission to return to his homeland for his mother's funeral despite the government's refusal. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 95-year-old mother died today in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> after making a deathbed request that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be allowed to return so that she could see him before she died. However, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said her predecessor remained unwelcome in the country as a threat to the nation's stability. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, in a statement, posed his return in political, as well as personal, terms, saying he wanted to help save the country from possible civil war or the threat of a communist takeover. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, 20 members of his staff and about 30 supporters gathered this morning to celebrate a Mass in memory of his mother at the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> estate overlooking downtown. `` I am completely shocked by the sudden demise of my beloved mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in the statement read by his spokesman, <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, to reporters outside the walled estate. `` I am sure that our Lord will take my dear mother into his kingdom to live the eternal life of heaven. This is indeed a very tragic personal matter for the entire <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` I will exhaust all possibilities that may still be available to us to return to our motherland, to help save her from the threatened communist takeover or a possible civil war,'' he said. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said that when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was informed that he would not be allowed back in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for mother's funeral, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said he would continue to negotiate `` but wo n't violate any laws to go back.'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said there has been no contact with the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government and the only word about Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision came from news reports. Asked about how <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were taking the death, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said, `` Both of them are calm but sad.''

The panelists noted that the infidelities of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the polio of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> were largely ignored in coverage of their presidential races. <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> said there has been a maturing of reporting and analysis, but added that journalists `` have not been cured of the urge to predict and handicap'' the races. Television has made progress, Ms. <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> said, but is still too dependent on `` snappy eight-second sound bites'' and is too preoccupied with polls. <PERSON> Bradlee </PERSON> said the 1988 campaign has become the longest ever and the length was hindering coverage. However, the character issues have changed the rules of journalism, he said, and the other panelists agreed with him. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> changed the political arena for better and forever,'' he said. He called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` the candidate of the left,'' which he said was still vital and alive in the country. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went beyond winning a victory or winning the nomination.

<TEXT>
 Fifteen utilities and cities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have agreed to pay $ 39.4 million to settle securities fraud claims against them stemming from a bond default on two abandoned nuclear power plants. The agreements announced Tuesday bring to about $ 243 million the total settlements reached so far in the giant legal action begun in 1982 after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> walked away from the plants and defaulted on $ 2.25 billion in bonds. Money from the bonds was used to start construction of the plants, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Nos. 4 and 5. The 15 parties settling Tuesday with plaintiff bondholders included 10 in the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entities </ORGANIZATION> group, which held 8 percent of the plants, and a group of five <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agencies, with 1.8 percent interest in the plants. The <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> group agreed to pay $ 32 million, while the five in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed to pay $ 7.4 million. Also this week, 24 utilities called the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> agreed to settle for $ 25.8 million. They hold a 6.5 percent interest in the plants. The settlements are subject to approval by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who has presided over the lawsuit. It is scheduled to go to trial Sept. 7 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The case, dubbed Multi-District Level 551, resulted from the biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market. Eighty-eight utilities agreed to build the two WPPSS plants during the 1970s, but the plants were abandoned after cost overruns and an assessment that the power from the plants would not be needed. The plants were among five the supply system attempted to build a decade ago. One is operating and two others have been partially completed but mothballed, with prospects uncertain they will ever be finished. Bonds that went to pay for the other three plants are being paid off by the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a federal power marketing agency, through an agreement with the supply system. Plants Nos. 4 and 5 did not come under the Bonneville umbrella. Negotiations continue in efforts to settle the rest of the suit.

 Federal ethics officials want to know why Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessmen to pay more than $ 3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. The Office of Government Ethics on Tuesday launched an investigation into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s April 26 letter, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, the head of the ethics office. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s letter _ written on his official stationery and emblazoned with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> seal _ was sent to 30,000 people whose names were `` provided by everyone from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the advisory committees on both sides, to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, chairman of the Citizen Ambassador Program, the profit-making group that is a cosponsor of the meeting along with a Japanese federation. A presidential order on ethics forbids federal officials from engaging in conduct that might present the appearance of favoritism, conflict of interest or loss of objectivity in governmental decision making.

The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, - based <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit organization set up originally in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by then-President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said The Citizen Ambassador Program, however, is a profit-making organization that works exclusively to set up international exchanges for People to People, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said Tuesday night in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` Yes, the Citizen Ambassador Program is for-profit, which is how <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> established the program with the intention of making it self-supporting,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. The cost for participants is listed as $ 3,240, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. He said the amount includes transportation and lodging and an $ 800 registration fee set by the Japanese organizing committee. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> acknowledged his company is paying $ 100 to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> for each person who signs up for the conference, but he denied that it was a payoff. `` Ever since the beginning of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> organization </ORGANIZATION>, the relationship has been that the delegates on any project pay a fee to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to become members,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. His company collects the fee from participants and pays it to People to People and the new members `` hopefully become involved in chapter projects, pen-pal projects, sister city projects and others.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he could not say how much profit his company might earn. `` I wish I knew,'' he said. `` It's not large. It depends on the participation in the conference.'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> became involved when `` People to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> came to us and represented themselves as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization.'' `` To the extent that they're linked to some group that is profit-making, that was not known by those making decisions on the attorney general's participation,'' he said. `` It could be argued that the department could engage in a joint venture so long as it was in the department's interest, and obviously we have an interest in international legal questions.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> sent out a similar letter and hosted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to a similar conference sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last summer, <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal and ethics authorities reviewed both cases to make sure the attorney general's participation was permissible, he said. The department covers <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s expenses for the trips. This year, he will be making an official visit at the same time to Japanese Minister of Justice <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashida </PERSON>. However, expenses for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, for last year's trip were paid by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> `` in return for the frankly exhausting role that she fulfilled in being head of the women's contingent for the conference,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said that was permissible under department regulations. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said the cost for the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> meeting, including transportation, was about $ 2,500. The two-page letter from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says, in part, `` Although attended and assisted by senior officials of the governments of both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the conference is fittingly a non-governmental one administered on behalf of the Japanese by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Keidanren </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and on the American side by the Citizen Ambassador Program of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> organization.'' `` I invite and encourage your participation. Sincerely <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Attorney General.'' In connection with the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup, administration sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was urged by his friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to get involved, then obtained a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> waiver letting him make a decision and approved a reversal of the department's previous position, urging a federal judge to lift restrictions barring the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies from entering various new types of business. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, whose telephone stock holdings and meetings with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> executives have been under criminal investigation, received <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s advice in a memo in mid-December 1986, the sources said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said Tuesday that he had `` no knowledge that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ever saw or read the memo,'' and that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to seek a waiver `` was based solely on the advice of the attorney general's staff.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, in which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> remains under criminal investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management will report that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, as counsel to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981, violated a White House ban on intervening in government contracts on behalf of friends when he tried to help <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, disputed the subcommittee's findings, saying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions `` did not give the appearance of impropriety'' and `` did not fall within the scope of the White House regulation.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, harvesting another pair of landslide primary victories, sounded ever more confident of his claim to the Democratic presidential nomination while rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> vowed today he's in the race `` all the way'' despite setbacks in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looked ahead to the fall and cautioned his supporters, `` We've got a long way to go.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored an expected victory Tuesday in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, but found himself slipping an additional 120 delegates behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won handily in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. His latest victories moved <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to fewer than 600 delegates from the 2,081 he needs to clinch the nomination. He also moved more than 600 ahead of his only rival. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave no sign he was ready to end what he called a struggle `` for the direction of our party and the soul of our nation.'' `` We're within striking distance,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' program. `` It's not over really till it's over. What's next is <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Asked if he is in the race for the long run, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` All the way.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was seeking support today among House Democrats and then holding strategy sessions with aides before flying off to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, which holds its primary Tuesday, as does <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said he would accept the No. 2 spot on the presidential ticket, but would advise front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to select a southerner. `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> is from southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, that's not enough,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said on the CBS show. `` It's got to be somebody from the South ... <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> or <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator frequently mentioned as a vice presidential candidate, said today he has `` not very much interest'' in taking the post. `` On a scale of one to 10, 10 being the most interest, my interest is about level one, so I have not very much interest,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. The senator said he would discuss the possibility with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when the candidate wants to talk. `` I've never desired that job, so we'll just have to roll up our pants when we get to the creek, and we're not to the creek yet,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders tempered their euphoria over the latest signal that their nomination marathon was over with concern that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s recent attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could provide campaign ammunition for the Republicans in the fall. `` I would hope he would n't say anything that could be used against <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> in the general election,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, who predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win the Democratic nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention in July. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnahan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jackso </PERSON>'s recent attacks were `` very disappointing. What he's managing to do is diminish his own stature. That view was by no means unanimous. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, vice chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said she was n't concerned about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s rhetoric. `` I do n't -LRB- believe -RRB- any of it is stuff we're going to see coming back at us out of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mouth,'' she said. `` He's trying to draw distinctions and I do n't blame him for that. I do n't think there is anything there that is problematic.'' Questioned today about the Democratic leaders' concerns, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Well, in this stage, I'm trying to help my chances and that's the first issue because both of us are running for the nomination.'' `` I'm not pushing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I'm pulling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and pulling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into facing issues that will make a difference in this country,'' he said on the CBS program. `` I challenge judgment, distinction and differences, but not integrity.'' When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should tone down his attacks, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor replied, `` He's got to make that judgment. I'm going to try to keep this as positive as I can.'' In recent days, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has repeatedly pressed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to provide more details of his plans for improving education and day care and reducing the federal budget deficit. No prominent Democrats were ready to call on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to end his campaign and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared content to see the contest play out through the final <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries on June 7. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said there were `` a number of governors who were willing to endorse him -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- before this time,'' but were discouraged by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He just did n't want to be perceived as trying to stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. `` He wanted to win the votes in the primaries ahead.'' Riding high after a streak of primary victories that included <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday night he thought it was `` going to be difficult'' for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to deny him the nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> celebrated his lock on the nomination at a hotel within walking distance of the White House and urged his supporters not to let up. `` I do n't feel any finality to what has happened now at all,'' he told a cheering crowd. `` We've passed the first step, a tremendously important step. ... But now we've got a long way to go.'' The vice president's son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, urged the partisan crowd: `` We want you to go out and kick some <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and kick him hard.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went over the top in his quest for a GOP convention majority last week in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rally he offered this preview of the fall campaign: `` Let <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> go around here talking about pink slips, despair, pessimism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'll be the guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge.'' There were 254 delegates at stake in the three primaries. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tally gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 1,486 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 927. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 860,896 or 63 percent, to 378,315 or 28 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, with 98 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 436,955 or 70 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 138,496 or 22 percent. In the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, final unofficial returns showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 67,812 votes, or 80 percent, while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 14,969, or 17 percent. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> captured 13 of the district's 16 Democratic convention delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 3. On the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 648,478 or 81 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> with 99 percent of the precincts reporting; 341,332 or 83 percent in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> with 98 percent of the precincts reporting; and 5,620 for 89 percent in final unofficial returns in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, where he resides.

<HEAD>Balloon Over Antarctic Confirms Gold's Supernova Origins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists say a balloon flight over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> has given them confirmation that supernovas are the only origin of gold and other heavier-than-iron elements such as copper and lead. `` The -LRB- 1987 -RRB- supernova explosion itself was one of the most significant events in 20th century astrophysics, and now it's giving us an opportunity to answer old questions on the origin of matter in the universe,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rester </PERSON>, director of APEX, the recently established Laboratory for Astrophysics and Planetary Exploration at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> Elements lighter than iron are formed under normal conditions within stars, but scientists have long theorized it would take the shock waves and extremely high temperatures of a supernova explosion to form most elements heavier than iron. Supernova explosions are rare and cause a star to suddenly become 10 million to 100 million times brighter. When astronomers spotted supernova 1987a last February, <PERSON> Rester </PERSON> saw a unique opportunity and quickly mobilized several agencies to investigate. On Jan. 8, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> launched a balloon, carrying an instrument called GRAD, for gamma ray advanced detector, from near <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. For three days it floated 22 miles above the earth, suspended from a helium balloon the size of a football field. From that vantage point, it had a clear view of supernova 1987a unobstructed by the Earth's atmosphere. The balloon-suspended instrument detected gamma rays from the radioactive decay of cobalt-56 to iron-56, proving that cobalt, which is heavier than iron, was formed in the supernova. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> researchers had detected radiation from cobalt-56 late last year, but <PERSON> Rester </PERSON> says the GRAD project provided much more detail. Color-shift readings also indicate the supernova did not explode symmetrically as an expanding sphere. Rather, it exploded with lobes and fingers protruding in several directions, with significant mixing of its core and mantle. <PERSON> Rester </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> scientist is examining the data to try to further reconstruct the explosion, which occurred 170,000 years ago, though the light reached the earth only last year.

 Iraqi warplanes bombed an Iranian oil refinery and a petrochemical complex today and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> claimed its anti-aircraft gunners shot down three of the attacking jets. The Iraqi raids were the first major attacks on Iranian cities since the two <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war foes halted the latest round of their so-called `` war of the cities'' April 21. They pounded each other's cities with more than 300 missiles Feb. 29-April 21. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted a military communique as saying one formation of fighter-bombers attacked and set fire to the refinery in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>. The refinery, one of five in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has a capacity of 48,000 barrels a day. Other warplanes hit a petrochemical plant in the area, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> report said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said several people were killed in the raids on Shiraz. Two French-built Mirage F-1s were downed in the second raid, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency reported that one pilot bailed out and was captured. There was no word on the fate of the other pilot. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said a third Iraqi jet was shot down, but did not say where or give any other details. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said an industrial plant in the oil-producing <LOCATION> Gachsaran </LOCATION> region, 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>, also was bombed in another <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raid. There was no mention of that raid in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> communique, which declared that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would inflict `` further painful blows on the Iranian regime'' until it complies with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution passed last July 20. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it will abide by the resolution if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has said it will not comply until <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is branded the aggressor. The Iraqi air force attacks <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refineries and other oil installations to throttle the Iranian economy and force and end to the 7 -LCB- - year-old war Oil industry sources have reported that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refining capacity has been cut by about one-third in recent weeks because of the bombing. This has forced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to import unprecedented amounts of refined products such as kerosene and jet fuel, the sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reported Iraqi warplanes repeatedly have flown over its western cities in the last few days. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the intruding jets were driven off by anti-aircraft fire. Both countries have claimed their border towns have come under artillery fire recently. Both have reported continued artillery battles and skirmishes along the 730-mile frontline in the past two weeks. But there has been no major ground action since April 18, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recaptured the southern <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seized control of the peninsula in February 1986. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reported sending tens of thousands of men to the front in a renewed mobilization following naval clashes with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it sank or disabled six Iranian vessels in the April 18 fighting.

<HEAD>Warhol Auction Brings in $25 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was an auction that publicity-savvy <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> would have loved, with enthusiastic buyers shelling out more than $ 25 million for the late pop artist's possessions, from plastic watches to paintings. By the time the final gavel fell Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s 10-day <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> sale, an estimated 60,000 people had passed through the auction house's galleries to view his private collection. `` We're thrilled,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` I think that from start to finish, it was one of the great sales in Sotheby's history.'' The sale brought in $ 25.3 million, well above <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s official pre-auction estimates of $ 9 million to $ 13 million but close to predictions by independent experts. `` Our feeling when we figured the estimates was that we would n't add any ` Warhol factor,''' said Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> `` I think what we're seeing today is an indication not only of the ` Warhol factor' but of a very strong art market. But a strong art market does not explain some of the sales, such as the $ 2,640 paid for three commercially manufactured, plastic watches bearing the likenesses of cartoon characters <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Flintstone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jetson </PERSON> and Gumby. `` You can not connect that with the normal art market,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Deitch </PERSON>, a vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> who buys art for the bank's clients. `` <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> had lots of enthusiastic admirers, and people want something that he chose. It means something to people.'' For whatever reason, buyers were willing to pay dearly for just about anything owned by <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, the artist who elevated the ordinary, like <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s soup cans, to art. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> died in February 1987. Sales figures included $ 23,000 for a pair of cookie jars; $ 55,000 for a set of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dali </LOCATION> ear clips; and $ 605,000 for a <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> painting, `` Sailboats.'' Proceeds from the auction go to the <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> Foundation for the <ORGANIZATION> Visual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which was established by the artist to support cultural institutions. The highest-priced item at the sale was an untitled 1967 painting by <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Twombley </PERSON> that fetched $ 990,000, a record for a work by that artist. It was one of many records set during the sale. The enthusiastic bidding, though, was a turn-off to some professional art dealers. `` It's a joke to attempt to buy here,'' complained <PERSON> Geert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think there are many dealers who could touch those prices _ or want to. You'd look crazy.'' Still, he would not say private collectors who claimed their piece of the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> legacy had made a mistake. `` Certainly in the past 30 years that I've been in the business, it really has n't mattered if someone overpaid _ even grossly overpaid'' for a work of art, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said. `` Time proved them right eventually.''

 `` Speed-The-Plow'' has more on its mind than <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. In fact, the Broadway debut of one of rock's biggest stars is not the reason to see playwright <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s brash, biting and lewdly funny look at the film industry. In `` Speed-The-Plow,'' <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> examines the art of the movie deal, which is not to be confused with the art of making a good movie. The play, in three short acts, skewers <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers with the same savage humor that <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> used to dissect <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> real estate salesmen in his Pulitzer Prize-winning `` Glengarry <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>.'' `` Speed-The-Plow,'' which opened Tuesday at Broadway's Royale Theater, is a small, narrowly focused evening, but it's absolutely on target, ambushing the egomaniacs who decide what reaches the silver screen. <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> has created two wonderful, would-be <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> magnates, the kind of guys who wear expensive, baggy Italian suits _ no ties _ and talk exclusively in movie industry lingo, dropping such lines as `` greenlighting a project'' or doing `` a courtesy read'' of a new book for the head of the studio. They have no ready cash and no apparent class. These two producers are also good friends, and <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> has some telling comments about what success does to relationships _ both male and female. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> -RRB- is the new head of production at a major studio and Charlie -LRB- <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> -RRB- has just wangled the services of a major star for a prison film. They need each other. All systems are go on the prison flick until a temporary secretary, played by <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, suggests a film based on a novel about the historical effects of nuclear radiation. It's that book the studio chief wanted <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> to read. And she's ready to be cut in on the deal. <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> and Silver are superb. <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> is all oily charm. He's ready to shake hands and stab backs at the same time Silver matches <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON>'s obnoxiousness and has a third-act temper tantrum that will probably bring him a Tony nomination. The play has received an extraordinary amount of attention because of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, but she is a minor and not very successful part of `` Speed-The-Plow.'' Her acting is tentative, devoid of any personality. She has none of the oomph needed to hold her own with the more flamboyant <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> and Silver. Director <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>, long associated with <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s plays, gives the play a hard-edged, staccato style. The actors machine-gun their lines to each other. The setting, designed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, is odd. Long, flowing curtains frame <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s new office, a collection of furniture covered with dropcloths. `` Speed-The-Plow'' wins this season's award for most obscure title. It's a variation on a line in `` The Conspiracy of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of Byron'' by Elizabethan playwright <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. The expression means `` do your work well'' or at least `` get on with it.'' <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> and two members of his cast have followed that advice. In other reviews: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> called the play `` riveting theater'' and `` a worthwhile, funny evening.'' <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> writes, has `` developed into a more inventive storyteller than most people working in the movies.'' He also praised the `` intelligent, scrupulously disciplined comic acting'' of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, whom he said `` needs only more confidence to relax a bit and fully command her speaking voice.'' But <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON>, drama critic for the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s performance falls short. `` Being vacant on the stage requires more effort than it does in real life,'' he writes. `` Elegantly designed, impeccably directed, ` Speed-the-Plow' is <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s clearest, wittiest play,'' he concluded. `` I bet it would be even funnier with an actress.' <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> review said the play `` is crammed with wonderful, dazzling, brilliant lines'' and it calls the cast of three `` two-thirds perfect and one-third hopeful.'' `` <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> tries hard in a <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> role, but sounds more as if she were auditioning than acting, and the audition is scarcely for the big time,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> is OK, sort of, but <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s ` Speed-the-Plow' ... with the irresistible <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> and a riveting breakthrough performance by <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, is a vicious, scabrous, hilarious, mean-spirited joy of a play,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON> said in Newsday. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s performance was `` a gutsy try,'' but in a scene that she must carry the play comes `` to a screeching stop while we wait for her to finish and for the professional actors to regain control,'' said <PERSON> Winer </PERSON>.

 Leftist guerrillas said they kidnapped a French diplomat, two West German honorary consuls and two Swiss trade officials.

Local police said four armed guerrillas kidnapped <PERSON> Markert </PERSON>, 59, from his metals company in <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>, 200 miles from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, as employees watched. Callers claiming to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> later told radio stations the abduction was a `` political act.''

The French spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, did confirm that <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Exiga </PERSON>, a French consular agent in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, escaped a kidnap attempt Tuesday thanks to intervention by police. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelez </PERSON>, the police commander in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, 190 miles west of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, said one policeman was killed and another wounded when they stopped the guerrillas, who escaped in a small car that was later found nearby, he said. It was not known what group the guerrillas were from. Two Swiss officials, <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aufdeeregger </PERSON>, were captured Tuesday by pro-Castro <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commandos who attacked the office of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombia-Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and overpowered 10 workers, police said.

 Students here boycotted school for a day and it was their parents' idea _ they're protesting a lack of library books and sports equipment. `` We are breaking our necks trying to get the kids to school,'' said principal <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnettler </PERSON>. `` Having adults tell them not to go to school, this has an effect on them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> organized the demonstration to demand more money for library books _ especially those for computer science and those in the Spanish language _ and physical education equipment. About 1,500 of the 1,763 students at the predominately <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> stayed away from classes Tuesday. A group of some 200 parents who organized the boycott stood outside the school to turn away all students except seniors, who need to fulfill class requirements for graduation. After spending a couple of hours at the school, the group marched two miles to <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and met with Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who told them of the lack of funds. `` They're getting their fair share,'' said board spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON>. `` In fact, they might be getting more than their fair share.'' Protest organizers later met with <PERSON> Schnettler </PERSON>, but failed to resolve anything, the principal said. `` The library is first-class,'' he said. `` None of us is denying the need for more books.'' At a meeting of 350 parents and school officials Monday night, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, the leader of the parent's group, said the boycott was necessary as `` a show of power.''

 Communist authorities agreed to let <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> intellectuals mediate in two major strikes, a Solidarity activist said today after <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> warned of `` a bloody revolution'' if workers do n't get a say in reform. At the huge <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard where Solidarity was born in 1980, workers in the third day of an occupation strike backed down from a demand that the outlawed independent labor federation be legalized nationwide. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a Solidarity founder, said strike leaders decided to limit the demand to Solidarity's shipyard branch because they felt they had a greater chance of success. `` There will be many different strikes around the country, even if they crush the shipyard, we will do it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told strikers after returning to the shipyard today. `` The only reason the entire country is not on strike is that it is too early.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops declared in a statement today that Polish society `` has the right to seek to be in charge of its own fate.'' The statement urged authorities to find common solutions for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by meeting with representative groups. It was the first official statement by the church on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since 1981 In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, Solidarity activist <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON> said authorities had agreed to permit a mediation role for five independent intellectuals linked with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which claims 94 percent of Poles as followers. He said the five had split into two groups, one leaving for the Lenin steelworks in the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, the other for the 12,000-worker shipyard in this Baltic port. The five included <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectuals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. His wife said he left today at the request of church authorities for the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> steelworks, now in the ninth day of a strike. At church headquarters in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, a secretary said a meeting was in progress and no one could comment, but there would be an announcement later. The mood was subdued in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> this morning. There was no heavy police presence as had been the case Tuesday night. About 3,000 workers spent the night in the yard and during the day their numbers rose to 7,000, said strike committee chairman <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>. Like the shipyard workers, the 15,000 striking steelworkers in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> are demanding higher wages, an independent union, reinstatement of fired union activists and release of political prisoners. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> news conference Tuesday that legalizing Solidarity `` is not a question that can be an object of negotiations ... It is not negotiable.'' Communist authorities crushed the movement with martial law in December 1981. At the shipyard Tuesday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told strikers, `` If we do n't achieve a real reform this time, then we will have a bloody revolution. However, the 44-year-old electrician also said <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON>, the deputy prime minister and architect of the government's reform program, `` is trying to do something. Let him talk to us and we can do it together.'' The government raised prices 42 percent this year as part of an attempt to overhaul the ailing economy. The strikes began April 25 with an 11-hour stoppage by transit workers in the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>. The strikers won a 60 percent raise. The next day, a strike began at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> _ the country's largest steel plant Workers at the defense-oriented foundry in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> won promises of higher pay in a two-day strike that ended Saturday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today denied a report, which originated with local Solidarity activist <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowicz </PERSON>, that 5,000 <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> ship-repair and port workers were idle Tuesday in sympathy with the Lenin shipyard strike. On Tuesday, police in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> dispersed protesters who marched in support of the strikers while in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, university students staged sympathy strikes, opposition spokesmen in the four cities said. Government and opposition spokesmen confirmed a brief work stoppage Tuesday at a railroad car plant in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, and opposition spokesmen said about 1,000 miners occupied the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> copper mine in western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for eight hours. Police have rounded up about a dozen opposition figures and apparently cut off the telephones of others. Sources said others went into hiding. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and eight other regional Solidarity leaders were arrested. Urban called the detentions `` preventive.'' He also reiterated the government position that bowing to strikers' demands for pay raises of up to 60 percent would upset economic reform and said strike leaders are `` professional politicians'' working for Western powers. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, led the August 1980 strike in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that toppled a government and co-signed the accords that made Solidarity the only free labor movement ever officially recognized in the Soviet bloc. The current labor trouble is the worst in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the crackdown on Solidarity, led by the country's current leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Families of the 16 people killed in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s deadliest passenger train crash will share a $ 58 million settlement reached with <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, but relatives said they could never be compensated for the loss of loved ones `` No it's not fair, but maybe it's as fair as things get. I'd just as soon see them bankrupt The fact is, what you want is your kid back. After that, nothing is fair,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON>, whose 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colley </PERSON>, was killed in the collision Jan. 4, 1987, at Chase. More than 175 people were injured when three linked <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engines skidded through a stop signal into the path of a 660-passenger <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train traveling about 120 mph. The tentative settlement of the families' lawsuits, announced Tuesday, is subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and various courts The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun in today's editions quoted an unidentified attorney as saying some families will get more than $ 1 million based on factors that jurors would have considered had the cases gone to trial. `` Some of the victims had no economic dependents, some were wage earners with families. Some were trapped for 11 hours and some were killed instantly,'' the lawyer said. But <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, whose daughter <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION>, 16, died in the collision, said, `` It could be $ 580 million and there still would be no satisfaction in it. Would I rather have my daughter back at the dinner table at night? Of course.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the image of `` lawyers with sharp pencils coming up with some horrible measurement of the worth of a life makes me just want to throw up every time I think about it.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said he hoped attention on the settlement would not distract from the continued effort for improved rail safety. `` I know there will be public interest in this settlement, and that's not bad or inappropriate. But what is really important is not the lawsuit, but reform legislation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. And here we are, 16 months after the accident and we do n't have a single line of reform legislation passed yet,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. He and other relatives of those killed have pushed unsuccessfully for legislation to require rail, bus and airline workers in critical positions to be randomly tested for drugs. Post-accident tests showed traces of marijuana in the blood and urine of the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer and the brakeman. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> agreed to settle the cases without conceding liability or the amount of damages incurred. The $ 58 million is in addition to $ 7.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> agreed to place in an escrow account as a part of a proposed settlement of a class-action suit brought by those injured in the collision. A separate lawsuit is pending in which <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to force <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to cover all amounts paid by <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> for passenger injuries and deaths arising from the accident. Former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who missed a track signal and drove three linked <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives through the track switch, was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> still faces federal charges for conspiracy, obstruction of an agency investigation, and lying to investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> about drug use.

With Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> barred by state law from seeking a third term, Democrats see a golden opportunity to end 20 years of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rule, and <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said as he claimed victory that his campaign would be `` as important as any in the history of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' A poll published Sunday by the Fort <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Journal-Gazette </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> with a 45 percent to 32 percent lead over <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>.

 Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has won the right to challenge his Republican boss, Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, easily defeating four opponents in a primary election. `` It's the highest honor and the best opportunity the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> people have ever given me,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Tuesday in an interview outside his hotel room after winning. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said his general election battle against <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> would be `` a classic race'' and said he was steadily narrowing the incumbent's lead. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had 391,482 votes, or 80 percent, with 96 percent of unofficial returns in. His closest opponent, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a service-station employee not related to governor, received 58,150 votes, or 12 percent. As lieutenant governor, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 55, put forward policy initiatives on economic development and dropout prevention, including a controversial plan to withhold driver's licenses from minors who quit school. He attacked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 52, as a governor who had done little of substance while taking credit for Democrats' accomplishments. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who had no opposition for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, hopes to become the first Republican governor in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to serve consecutive terms. He was only the state's second <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor this century. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a former six-term congressman and <ORGANIZATION> Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> chemistry professor, pointed to glowing economic statistics during his term and questioned <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s leadership skills.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Objects To New Building Near His Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swayed by a complaint from Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, city authorities said today they have withheld permission to build a nine-story apartment house overlooking the <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> residence of the heir to the British throne. The planning committee for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> boroughs of <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> said it deferred its decision after receiving a letter `` from a very eminent neighbor'' just before a Tuesday night meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Regalian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> wants to put up a building with 45 apartments worth between $ 4.6 million and $ 11.2 million each on two-thirds of an acre near the palace. The letter to the council, written on Buckingham Palace stationery, was signed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the prince's deputy private secretary, said a borough spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The building seems to us to be an overdevelopment of the site,'' the spokesman quoted the letter as saying. He said the committee would reconsider the application only after the architect revised the plans. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' intervention came as no surprise. The prince has outspokenly criticized modern architects, whom he has accused of ruining <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s skyline and ignoring the opinions of ordinary people. Committee chairman <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Ewing </PERSON> said the panel might have withheld permission regardless of the prince's opinion, because the new building was `` too tall'' and the architecture `` insensitive.'' But the letter from the palace `` added some sway _ I certainly ca n't deny that,'' he added.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> acknowledged today the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration scuttled plans to send <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> because of strong congressional opposition. `` There were considerable objections on the part of the -LRB- Capitol -RRB- <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> when we consulted the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and we decided it would be best not to go ahead at this time,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' program The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had been considering taking up to six <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats off anti-drug patrols and sending them to the gulf. But the idea was sharply criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier this week that the plan `` was a non-starter from the beginning and I'm glad <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> could understand that That idea was going nowhere.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said the decision came after <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> listened `` carefully to those of us in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including myself, and the leadership who suggested that this would not be the right time to take <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration is using its naval fleet to protect 11 Kuwaiti-owned but U.S.-flagged tankers. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced this week that it will respond to pleas for help from any neutral merchant ships which are attacked in the war-torn gulf. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships have an advantage over <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships because `` they're shallow-draft ships and therefore less vulnerable to mines and we looked at it from a military point of view.''

 After an appeal by <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s mayor, the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved a measure that would let voters decide whether to impose a seven-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said the cooling-off period was needed to help prevent a repeat of shootings like three in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area aimed at law enforcement officers, one of whom was killed. `` I've been on national TV the last few days constantly answering questons on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> being <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>. `` Our circumstances right now in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> are not good.''

Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, the measure's sponsor, said he proposed the waiting period in part to counteract the damage to the state's image from a 1987 law making it easier for people to carry concealed weapons `` As a result of the legislation we passed, ... we have nationally achieved not the reputation I would like,'' said Silver. `` We have achieved bad press.'' <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said that if his legislation fails, he would back a signature drive to place the constitutional amendment on the November ballot. Signatures from several hundred thousand registered voters across the state would be needed.

<HEAD>More Getting Refunds Despite New Law, Murky Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More Americans received federal tax refunds this year than last despite a thorough revision of the tax law and a confusing withholding form, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today. Through April 29, the latest figures available, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had certified 55.5 million refunds, compared with 55.4 million at the same time last year. Refunds were claimed on 79.5 percent of the returns that had been processed, up from 79.1 percent a year ago. `` Apparently withholding was more in line with tax liability than we had been expecting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Johnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. Tax experts had anticipated that fewer people might qualify for refunds this year because the new tax law required all employees to file new W-4 withholding forms with their employers in 1987. The first version of the new form was designed to match tax liability with withholding. But it was so confusing that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> eventually developed an alternative, W-4A, that was simpler but less accurate. Another forecast _ that fewer people would itemize deductions under the new law _ was closer to target. Through April 15, slightly fewer than half the 49 million couples and individuals who filed the long form, 1040, itemized deductions, compared with 60 percent last year. Through Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 98.6 million returns, a 2 percent increase over 96.7 million in the same period in 1987. Before the year is out, the agency anticipates 107.6 million total filings, compared with 104 million last year. Some other statistics from this year's filing season: _ Almost 4.8 million people have asked so far for automatic four-month extensions beyond the April 15 filing deadline At this time last year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had counted about 4.4 million. For reasons the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can not explain, the number of extensions fluctuated significantly among the 10 regional centers. At <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, extensions were 28 percent below last year's mark while at <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> they were up 47 percent. _ The average refund this year has been $ 850, compared with just under $ 849 last year _ The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has processed 69.9 million returns so far this year, down 0.2 percent from 70 million in 1987 _ Only slightly more couples and individuals hired professionals to fill out their returns this year, despite confusion about the new law Through April 15, 45.6 percent of the returns were professionally prepared, compared with 44.9 percent at the same time last year.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> overcame questions about his youth and inexperience, trouncing his opponent for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s Democratic nomination for governor. In the presidential primaries, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled to easy victories. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, the 32-year-old son of former Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, piled up nearly an 8-1 victory margin over former <PERSON> Kokomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Daily, who had tried to draw attention to <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s lack of experience. `` He's shown in very dramatic and powerful fashion that the voters _ at least the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters _ do n't think that's an issue,'' said Daily, 40. With 81 percent of precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> had 382,390 votes, or 83 percent, to 51,146, or 11 percent for Daily. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> was beating Daily in each of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s 92 counties, including <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Daily's home. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> will face Lt. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>, 52, who was unopposed for the Republican nomination. Current GOP Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who at 71 is the nation's oldest governor, was barred from seeking a third straight term. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, if elected, would be the state's youngest chief executive this century.

In the presidential primary, with 80 percent of the vote counted, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 350,074 votes, or 70 percent, to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 110,507 or 22 percent, with the remainder divided among candidates who have dropped out of the race. In the Republican race, with 80 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, had 292,072 votes, or 84 percent. The remainder went to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The state will send 79 delegates to the Democratic convention and 51 to the Republican meeting. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, in claiming victory, said, `` This campaign begins tonight and it will be as important as any in the history of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' He challenged <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON> to a series of debates. <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON> said he liked the idea of debating his opponent, saying it would compare `` abilities to lead a very large institution, that being the state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>, a 20-year veteran of government service, has tried to make an issue of <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s youth and his relative lack of experience after only two years in statewide office. Introducing his son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, at a victory gathering, <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON> said, `` Like another young attorney who's been practicing law in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> for less than two years, he's not ready to be governor.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Bannon </PERSON>, whose name was placed on the Democratic ballot by <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s campaign in case <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> lost a challenge to his eligibiity, ran a distant third.

The doctor hired by federal prosecutors, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Canary </PERSON>, said on Feb. 26 that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> could work four hours a day. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> -RRB- has been advised by his treating physicians and a renowned endocrinologist that Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Canary </PERSON>'s findings border on the preposterous,'' <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> wrote. `` He is not currently capable of assisting in his defense.'' <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>'s letter Tuesday was his first public comment after published reports that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> had health problems that required two recent hospital visits. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s medical history includes open-heart surgery in 1985 and the removal of a malignant lung tumor in January 1987. The letter and a motion filed in federal court Tuesday repeated <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>'s demands for documents showing the `` symbiotic relationship'' among <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, co-defendant <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's time to remove the cloak of secrecy the government has used to hide the facts of this case from the defendants and this court,'' the motion states.

 The former secretary to the executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate says she took copies of documents from his files because she thought he was stealing from the estate and wanted to expose him. <PERSON> Helaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Golding </PERSON>, in testimony Tuesday, admitted she told acquaintances she was so angry with attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> that she threatened to sell her story on <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> to the National Enquirer. `` I said everyone should know what this man's done,'' she said. `` I said I will go to the Enquirer so everyone knows.'' Five Liberace associates have filed a civil lawsuit seeking to have Strote removed as executor and trustee, claiming <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was too ill to know what he was doing when he signed documents Jan. 22, 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> claimed Strote billed the estate of the famous pianist for time he actually spent with other clients, from professional wrestlers to disc jockeys. She also alleged he got <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> to sign blank documents in the final weeks before his death from AIDS on Feb. 4, 1987. She said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> warned her `` Be careful of these, we ca n't get another signature. Do n't screw up.'' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> drew up <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s will and had it signed 13 days before the entertainer's death. The new will made Strote executor of the estate and head of two <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> trusts. Ms. <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> said she went to work for Strote Jan. 5, 1987 and handled most of the correspondence involving <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>. She said she sent copies of all correspondence to the entertainer until mid-January when <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> told her to quit doing so, saying <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> could no longer read and understand the material being sent him. She said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> was visibly upset when he returned from a visit to <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> condominium Jan. 15, 1987, the day he met with the entertainer to draft a new will. `` Mr. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said ` He looks awful. It's all over,''' Ms. <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> testified. Ms. <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> presented her with copies of quitclaim deeds that were blank except for <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s signature, and told her to type in legal descriptions of <LOCATION> Liberace </LOCATION> real estate. `` I remember seeing how shaky it was,'' she said. `` It was n't the usual flourish.

<HEAD>Fugitive Who Used Dead Man's Identity for 12 Years Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man has been found out and arrested 12 years after he skipped out on drug charges and began living the life of a well-respected, law-abiding citizen under a dead man's name. The new life he had built for himself was shattered Tuesday, police said, when <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law agents arrested the man who called himself <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON>. Agents said <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON>, general manager of a seafood restaurant, was really <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON>, who jumped bail on <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> heroin charges in 1976. <PERSON> Miste </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON>, the arrested man's wife, was astounded when she learned her husband and the father of their two preschool boys really was named <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON> and that he had been arrested. `` We've been married for six years. I knew him for three years before that'' in her hometown of <LOCATION> Destin </LOCATION>, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON> said she never had heard the name <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON>. `` He's a wonderful man,'' she said. At an initial appearance before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Game </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON> said he had been an addict but was clean under his assumed name of <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON> is charged with the federal crime of giving phony Social Security numbers to get a driver's license and bank loans. Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Ruling he was a risk to flee prosecution, Game ordered <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON> held without bail until a hearing Friday. According to court records, <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON>'s first arrest came on a charge of selling LSD in 1969 when he was 19. A series of drug arrests followed. Twice in 1976, on May 13 and 26, <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and charged with heroin possession, according to court records. He was released on $ 5,000 bail, but failed to show up and an arrest warrant was issued. <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON>, who assumed the name of <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON> after that man had been buried for more than a year, recently came to the attention of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> agents while they were looking for a another fugitive. Agent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> found that the description on <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON>'s driver's license did n't match the man who was carrying it In tracing telephone calls, he found that one woman `` Wallen'' frequently called in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON>'s mother. Confronted at work Tuesday, <PERSON> Haulk </PERSON> `` did not deny who he was,'' <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The famed <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> lighthouse in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> could be moved about 500 feet inland to save it from an eroding seashore, a committee of experts decided in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report. The report said that errosion has placed the 208-foot-tall landmark, which has flashed its warning to mariners for more than 100 years, in danger of being damaged or destroyed by a severe hurricane. Errosion has whittled the beach to within 160 feet of the tower, according to the report, which was made available this week. Moving the lighthouse would be a more practical way of saving it than trying to protect the site from erosion by the sea, the study said. Other methods of protecting the lighthouse, such as building a seawall around it, also were examined. The landmark structure is the tallest brick lighthouse in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and weighs about 2,800 tons. The lighthouse was built in 1870 on a point of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> barrier islands to warn sailors of the Diamond Shoals area just outside the islands. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> asked for the study. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is the operating agency of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and Engineering. The study does not comment on the advisability of saving the lighthouse, but addresses only the technical ways of doing so.

 A free steak while chatting with a Penthouse Pet is just one of the factors that led truckers nationwide to tab the SOS Auto-Truck Stop one of the best truck stops in the country. `` We listen to the truck drivers,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, marketing officer for <ORGANIZATION> SOS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the truck stop. `` That's simple and basic, but it's often ignored by retailers.''

The SOS promotion last year, which allowed drivers with commercial licenses to dine on free steaks while talking to Penthouse Pet <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON>, drew more than 4,000 drivers a day. Other reasons cited for the stop's popularity are good home cooking, abundant parking space and clean bathrooms _ three musts for truckers. `` Their food is reasonable.

<HEAD>Attorney General To Withdraw From Financial-Disclosure
Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state attorney general says that to avoid the appearance of a conflict he will turn over his investigation of Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s financial disclosures to a county attorney's office. Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> criticized Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> for the Tuesday decision, saying <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> should have the `` guts'' to do his duty. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office is currently prosecuting <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> for campaign reporting violations. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Tuesday he decided to withdraw from the investigation of whether Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> had violated financial disclosure statutes because he is next in line to become governor. `` If I were to bring charges, I would be accused of doing it to become governor,'' he said. But he said the investigation would be called `` a whitewash'' if it cleared Mofford. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> because she was secretary of state; her successor as secretary of state can not become governor because he was appointed, not elected. `` There is no legal conflict,'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said, `` but there is an appearance. I decided it would be better if we had somebody else take a look at it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has acknowledged that she erred in not reporting a series of loans, land holdings or other deals on her financial-disclosure statements dating back to 1978. She filed amended reports last week and made public 150 pages of legal documents. Her news aide, <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> feels she will be exonerated and has no problem with an independent counsel conducting the investigation. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Tuesday night that he had asked <LOCATION> Pima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> to conduct the probe. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> would have the option of bringing in another county attorney if necessary to assist in the investigation. In the past, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> has called on Neely, or other county attorneys, to handle cases when the attorney general's office has had a conflict. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who is being prosecuted by <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> for failing to disclose a $ 350,000 campaign loan, was critical of the attorney general for withdrawing from the Mofford probe. `` Tell him to have the guts to stand up and do his duty,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, whose criminal trial begins May 19. `` Do n't take a powder. Do n't run out of it. Conflict of interest? When did conflict of interest have anything to do with him? Do n't hide behind a conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> had a conflict of interest when he investigated <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, but `` that did n't dissuade him,'' the former governor said.

<HEAD>Army Simulates Germ Warfare in Open Air Tests at Utah Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army has conducted 173 open-air trials of organisms that simulate hazardous germ warfare agents over the last decade at this base in western <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s desert, a spokeswoman said. Information provided to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Dugway scientists shows that since 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> conducted eight major experiments involving biological agents at the base. Those experiments required 173 releases of organisms into the air. The purpose of the experiments is defensive, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. They allow the military to test such items as germ warfare detectors and alarm systems designed to alert troops they are under germ-warfare attack; to test whether certain chemicals might protect against an attack; and to see how well tank-protection systems work. Dugway spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said that in 1977, the Army released information about open-air testing up to that time. Those documents listed at least 84 tests at Dugway, some using simulants for hazardous germs and some using actual biological agents that were banned in 1969. A simulant is an organism that is similar to hazardous germs, exhibiting some of the same characteristics, but is not considered harmful itself by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> scientists. It can be either naturally occurring or a manmade strain. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Deseret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, however, some scientists believe that certain of the simulants are more dangerous than the Army thought. Four trials in 1978 used the simulant Serratia marcescens. The test was to determine whether substances used to neutralize chemical weapons could do the same against biological weapons. The Army has said that organism is harmless, but has since discontinued its use. In 1979, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, a specialist in infectious diseases, published an article saying the organism can cause meningitis, wound infection and arthritis. One hundred sixty-six of the remaining 169 tests since 19877 used the <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> variant of Bacillus subtillus, which the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> also says is safe. However, <ORGANIZATION> Rutger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, in his book `` Clouds of Secrecy,'' said doctors fear Bacillus subtillus may cause infections and invade the bloodstream in debilitating diseases. He said some scientists have also suggested that the organism can easily serve as a carrier for other dangerous viruses. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> strain is harmless, although other strains are not. The last such open-air test, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was conducted in September 1986.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today it arrested a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> spy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after he entered the country illegally carrying $ 4.5 million. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> severed relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week. The expelled Iranian diplomats arrived home today and accused the Saudis of beating them and of taking documents from their offices _ claims denied by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. There was no immediate Saudi comment on the Iranian report that a spy had been arrested. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said security officials `` arrested an agent of the <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> regime who had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials -LRB- $ 4.5 million -RRB-.'' It quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the man, whose name was not disclosed, was planning to `` spread Wahhabi faith and the American brand of Islam.'' The Saudi ruling family and most other Saudis are Wahhabis, a conservative Sunni Moslem sect. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, like the other <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> states, is run by <PERSON> Sunnis </PERSON>, while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic government and most Iranians are Shiite Moslems. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not say when the man was arrested. However, it charged intelligence reports had confirmed links between Wahhabi groups inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents. It said the man arrested `` will be dealt with as a spy.'' Convicted spies may be sentenced to death under Islamic law. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Iranian charge d'affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarani </PERSON> as saying Saudi security forces raided <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> and the Iranian consulate in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> on Tuesday and beat Iranian staffers. The agency reported <PERSON> Tarani </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> took many important documents and forced the Iranians from their homes. He made the accusations upon arriving at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> airport today, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. Tuesday was the deadline set by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for Iranian diplomatic personnel to leave the kingdom. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> said the Iranian embassy and consulate were vacant by dusk Tuesday, with only a few Saudi policemen patrolling outside each building. They said they believed the Iranian personnel had left peacefully and there had been no violence. The official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an unidentified government official as calling the Iranian accusations `` completely false and totally baseless. `` All personnel of the Iranian consulate and embassy, taking along all their equipment, left in a calm, peaceful manner without any harm befalling them,'' the official was quoted as saying. The official noted the Saudis did not retaliate in August when an Iranian mob attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> following riots in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, ransacking the building and killing a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> diplomat. More than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians, were killed in the July 31 riots, which followed Iranian political demonstrations during the annual pilgrimage. The riots were the main reason cited by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for breaking diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has called for the overthrow of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> rulers and demanded they be stripped of control of Moslem shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also accuses the Saudis of backing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war.

 One astrologer insists President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> schedules his news conferences during the full moon. Her stars may tell her that, but the record here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> shows otherwise. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> astrologer who claims to have dealt with the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the president has used astrology to schedule major events. `` Look at when he holds his news conferences. They're usually during a full moon. He chooses those times to do it,'' she said. But a check of the last five presidential news conferences, going back to August 1986, found that only one, last Oct. 22, was scheduled during a full moon. The other four dates were Aug. 12 and Nov. 19, 1986, March 19, 1987, and Feb. 24, 1988. A White House spokesman says the Reagans do not know Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court Rules Port Elizabeth Beaches Must Be Open To All Races</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A court in Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> ruled today that the city's segregated beaches must be open to people of all races. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said a 1966 city council resolution proclaiming the beaches segregated was invalid. Upon hearing of the ruling, some blacks immediately went to previously `` whites only'' beaches to celebrate. City councilor <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loonat </PERSON>, made the application to have the beaches opened to all races. The measure was opposed by Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> and the administrator of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> called the decision `` a small victory for those of us fighting what sometimes seems to be a losing battle against the continuous inroads made by the government against basic human rights.'' Most beaches in the larger coastal cities of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> are open to all races. However, many beaches in smaller communities remain segregated.

 Space shuttle astronauts and launch pad workers conducted an escape drill from a mock launch pad fire and explosion today in a rehearsal designed to help improve safety following the Challenger tragedy. Several personnel received make-believe injuries in the disaster exercise, and 11, including two astronauts, were evacuated by helicopter to two hospitals that conducted their own emergency rehearsals. The other five astronauts and some pad workers were treated for minor `` injuries'' at the scene, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The astronauts, all rookies who have not flown in space, rode elevators to the 195-foot level of launch pad 39B as if they were to board a shuttle on launch day. Although there was no shuttle on the pad, they simulated entry into a spacecraft cabin. Following a report of smoke somewhere on the launch pad, test director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> called a `` major emergency'' and ordered an evacuation. With water spraying the area as it would in a real emergency, the astronauts and the seven members of the spacecraft closeout crew donned oxygen masks and made their way to seven slidewire baskets at the cabin level of the pad. Seven fire-rescue workers rushed to the pad from a station a mile away. As they fought a mock fire at the 175-foot level an `` hydraulic explosion'' occurred and test observers declared five of the firefighters `` injured.'' They and the other simulated injured personnel were ferried by helicopter to hospitals. Seven went to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and four to <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>. All those on the pad made their way to the baskets, each of which holds three people, but did not ride them down 1,200-foot cables to the ground. Some officials believe the swift 50 mph ride and abrupt halt in netting at the bottom would be risky and should be attempted only in an actual emergency. Instead, the baskets were sent down with ballast and the astronauts and others took an elevator to ground level and re-entered the baskets. Those not `` injured'' made their way to a concrete bunker near the launch pad. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to test the baskets with human passengers sometime before the next space shuttle flight. That flight has been postponed until late August or early September, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said today. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Challenger and its seven crew members were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986. A faulty booster rocket joint that allowed flames to escape caused the Challenger tragedy, and the biggest delay in launching the next shuttle has been in assembling the two rocket boosters that power it into orbit. Officials said the drill today would allow the astronauts to test new crew escape equipment intended to give them a better chance to survive a launch oad problem. Among the most important features of the upgraded system is the addition of more fire detection equipment and a backup electrical relay line that would flash a warning to launch directors if a pad emergency occurred. Fire-inhibiting metal plating also has been added to the platform that connects the launch tower to the shuttle cabin. Two slidewire baskets have been added and all have been wrapped in fire resistant material. Astronauts participating today were <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuot </PERSON> and Jerome Apt. Another emergency drill is scheduled Friday to rehearse a rescue of crew members from a shuttle that has `` crash-landed'' in a swamp near the shuttle landing runway here.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he believes he still can capture the Democratic presidential nomination despite resounding losses to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won the race for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s much smaller delegate package. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters he was concerned about fairness in the allocation of delegates who will choose the nominee, but did not say specifically how he might challenge the process. `` I can only appeal very openly for fairness,'' he said at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. `` We're within striking distance,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said earlier on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not over really till it's over. What's next is <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. ... We look forward to these remaining contests and we are not only setting the pace for the campaign but setting the agenda as well.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met early today with about 50 or 60 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus. The caucus chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, characterized it as a `` very warm and successful meeting,'' and said `` everyone admires the grace and tone'' with which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has conducted his campaign. At his news conference, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads him by only 8 percentage points in the popular vote. He said that margin should be reflected in the voting by super delegates _ those delegates selected by virtue of holding important party positions or public office. `` The super delegates will do <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a super favor by not interfering in the process. ... I simply want fairness,'' he said. Although the super delegate process was set up to enable those delegates to commit to the candidate of their choosing, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said they should follow the popular vote, and he suggested they should not take a bandwagon approach to the nomination before the primary season is over. `` If super delegates wait until after June 8 they are in a better position as judges to help bring balance'' rather than using party machinery to parcel out delegates before the primaries end, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on CBS that he has gained victories despite `` the party machinery, the pundits and the press.'' `` The party machinery is saying, in fact, go for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The pundits are saying go for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In some sense, the super delegates are moving in that direction and so against the party, the pundits, the press. We press on against those odds,'' he said. `` We're not about to turn back.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> slid further behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the overall delegate count, losing in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> by margins of greater than 2-to-1. In total delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by more than 500. In the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, which he also swept in his 1984 presidential race, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up 80 percent of the vote to 18 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scheduled a strategy pow-wow this afternoon with top advisers. Aides said the discussion would likely focus on mapping out the campaign through the remainder of the primaries and on what the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces will do at the convention. June 7 marks the end of the primary season, with votes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s schedule for the rest of the month includes heavy concentration on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which offers the biggest delegate prize in the nation, with a few days spent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and brief forays to the small states remaining on the primary calendar. Today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with 13 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who are part of a `` Go West'88'' group that is trying to focus the presidential contest on Western issues. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., an organizer of the group, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> discussed issues of concern to them, including trade, drugs, immigration and energy `` He made it clear trade expansion was something very important on his agenda,'' said <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, who told reporters the sessiom was `` a very positive kind of discussion.'' The group also hopes to meet with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said. Despite a series of losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> showed no signs of giving up his campaign and vowed to continue pressing the issues he has fought for _ reversal of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies and a war on drugs. He said his campaign did not start with the kickoff of the primary season in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and will not end with the Democratic convention this summer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` It began in the back of a bus in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and now it's three steps from the White House. We're on our way,'' he said, as he recalled the civil rights battles a generation ago. File Stored As: Z1838 A47 0789 11:48 05-04 -- -- - upbx PM-Jackson, 3rd Ld-Writethru, a0620,

 An aide to presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he apparently made a mistake in saying that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made about $ 46,000 in consulting wages from entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> last year. `` Obviously what I said was n't quite right ... There obviously needs to be some clarification. At this point I do n't have the clarification,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a long-time associate of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and political director of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he spoke to <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and his wife after their spokesman disputed <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' explanation on Tuesday of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s income tax returns `` They just said they needed to talk to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' about the matter, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said, adding he was trying to get the matter cleared up, but had not been able to talk to the accountant who prepared the taxes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Tuesday released four years worth of federal income tax returns. When asked about the Cosby consulting fee, he said he would provide an accounting to reporters at a later time. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife had income of nearly $ 210,000 in 1987 and paid about one-fourth of that in federal taxes, they reported in their federal tax returns. The bulk of the income last year, $ 159,000, came from <ORGANIZATION> Personalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a corporation headed by <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that provides management for clients and handles most of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s earnings from speaking fees and publications. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is on contract to the corporation but is not a shareholder, director or officer, according to his presidential campaign. He reported the money in the category of wages and salaries. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also reported $ 46,535 in fees for business services, but where that money came from quickly became a source of controversy. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said most of that was in consulting fees from Cosby. `` I do n't know the nature of the work,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said on Tuesday. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> public relations agent who works for <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, quoted <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> as saying, `` That's way off the mark.'' <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> added, `` He did not provide <PERSON> Reverand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with most of the $ 46,535 for business services.'' Asked how much <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> did pay <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> says that's none of your business ... or check with <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>.'' Cosby is a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter and has made a television ad for the campaign, as well as doing benefit performances. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> promised reporters Tuesday night he would provide more details on his finances at a briefing later. His Democratic presidential campaign released copies of his tax returns for 1984 through 1987. Together with dividends, interest and other income, the couple's 1987 joint total income was $ 209,358, before adjustments They reported $ 3,474 in interest and dividend income. Their tax for the year was $ 53,019. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is a minister, and his wife reported paying $ 2,145 in unspecified cash contributions during 1987. Like many American families, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife took advantage of the working couple deduction until last year, when that deduction was lost. For 1987, the returns did not distinguish between income received by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and by his wife, who is president and a director of <ORGANIZATION> Personalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said she also was paid for speaking engagements On their 1986 returns, $ 55,000 was reported as income received by Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The Jacksons' income rose quickly after 1984, the year of his first presidential campaign. They reported income that year of $ 59,453, including more than $ 6,000 in interest income. Their federal taxes that year were $ 12,103, according to the documents. A year later, 1985, their income jumped to $ 187,839. They paid $ 55,809 in federal tax, taking advantage of income averaging. In 1986, they reported $ 186,043 in income, including $ 13,633 in dividends from <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> holds stock in.

 Increasing numbers of deadly weapons have been seized at city public schools this year and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> is considering setting up metal detectors to search students, an official said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Irushalmi </PERSON>, director of the board's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he had been asked by Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to study the feasibility of metal detectors. <PERSON> Irushalmi </PERSON> said 1,400 incidents involving weapons were reported in the last school year _ a figure he expects will rise by 10 percent by the end of this school year in June.

<HEAD>Acreage Plantings Same This Year As Last Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers may be planting almost as many acres for the 1988 crop harvests as they did last year, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst. And that is having some effect on the amount of land farmers are putting into the long-term Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Based on surveys taken in March, farmers indicated they would reduce 1988 plantings of major crops by only 871,000 acres, he said in the current issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` This is in marked contrast to 1987, when area planted to the same crops fell 24.1 million acres, and to 1986, when the decline was 14.2 million,'' he said. For example, the March survey showed corn plantings this year may be around 66.9 million acres, up by almost 2 percent from 1987. But last year's corn plantings, at 65.7 million acres, plummeted 14 percent from 76.7 million acres in 1986. The total wheat acreage planted for the 1988 harvest was estimated at 65.1 million acres, down about 1.1 percent from last year. The 1987 wheat crop was planted on 65.8 million acres, a drop of more than 8 percent from 72.1 million acres in 1986. `` Higher prices, lower acreage reduction requirements for cotton and rice programs, reduced paid land diversion payments, and possibly lower program participation rates are partially offsetting the continued entry of area into the long-term Conservation Reserve Program,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Commodity prices received in March were up 10 percent, overall, from a year earlier, including: feed grains, 22 percent; cotton, 21 percent; oilseeds, mainly soybeans, 19 percent; and food grains, 13 percent. `` However, crop prices are not high by historical standards, and corn is still below the national average -LRB- price support -RRB- loan rate,'' he said. `` Over the same period, the index of prices paid, interest, taxes and farm wage rates increased only 4.4 percent.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projections, corn prices may average around $ 1.75 per bushel in the 1987-88 marketing year, up from $ 1.50 in 1986-87. The 1988-crop corn price support loan nationally is $ 1.77 per bushel. Six sign ups for the long-term <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> have been held since the program got under way in 1986, the most recent earlier this year when farmers offered bids to take 4.5 million acres of highly erodible crop land from production. Although no decision on how much land will be accepted from the 4.5 million acres offered in the latest bids, around 23 million acres were enrolled in the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> in earlier rounds. The 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres of land in the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> by 1990. Under the program, farmers agree to keep the land out of crop production for 10 years and get financial help to plant protective grass or trees, plus annual rental payments from the government. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the latest signup `` did not attract heavy bidding'' by farmers who wanted to enroll their land, which makes the 1990 goal of the program more difficult. But <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fesco </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, a private, non-profit Washington-based conservation organization, said she did not think the slowdown in <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> offerings means much as far as the goal is concerned. `` We still think that that is very possible and that we wo n't have a problem of reaching the 45 million-acre goal,'' she said Tuesday `` We're going to continue working towards that. We have n't lost faith in the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> to date, and neither have any of the other conservation or environmental groups that I'm aware of.

Instead, the development of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s small towns and farms should rest on diversification and the energies of local people, the report said Tuesday. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON>, undersecretary for small community and rural development, said cooperative federal efforts now under way are helping rural communities regain economic stability. <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> said rural communities suffered from inflation in the late 1970s, global economic recession and farmland value losses in the early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production. `` In the past, rural economic development has been dependent on farm policy and income,'' he said. `` We now recognize that the future growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent on diversification at the local level, both in farm production and in the other business segments of community and state economies.'' The 19-page report itself added: `` The current federal initiative -LRB- on rural development -RRB- stresses the need for rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to look within for development possibilities. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s small and rural communities need to realize there are simply not enough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promote development.'' Field hearings are being planned so that <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> can `` listen to the needs and concerns of the local officials, residents, students, teachers, business people and senior citizens,'' the report said. The report outlined rural economic development programs available at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and at other federal agencies.

 Iraqi warplanes bombed an Iranian oil refinery and petrochemical plant Wednesday in an escalation of attacks on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economic mainstay. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said three jets were shot down. The Iraqi raids were the first major attacks on Iranian cities since April 21, when the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war foes began a tacit cease-fire in their `` war of the cities'' after a deadly seven-week missile duel. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacked after <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> accused the Iranians of shelling the northeastern Iraqi town of <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> early Wednesday in `` a premeditated attempt to spark off the war of the cities again.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s War Information Headquarters denied the charge and said the Iraqis were seeking to `` pave the way for more Iraqi attacks on Iranian residential areas.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said a squadron of fighter-bombers pounded the refinery in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>, setting it ablaze and leaving it shrouded in black smoke. The refinery, one of five in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has a capacity of 48,000 barrels a day. Other warplanes hit a `` highly important'' petrochemical plant in the area, the agency reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said several workers were killed in the Iraqi raids. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian anti-aircraft fire downed two French-built Mirage F-1s in the second raid. It said one pilot bailed out and was captured, but there was no word on the fate of the other pilot. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said a third Iraqi jet was shot down but did not say where or give any other details. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said an industrial plant in the oil-producing <LOCATION> Gachsaran </LOCATION> region, 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Shiraz </LOCATION>, was also bombed. The Iraqi communique made no mention of a raid on Gachsaran or of any losses of life or aircraft. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s powerful air force has been pounding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refineries and other oil installations for months, seeking to throttle its economy and force it to the negotiating table to end the 7 -LCB- - year-old war Oil industry sources have reported that the bombing has slashed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refining capacity by around one-third in recent weeks, forcing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to import unprecedented amounts of refined products such as kerosene and jet fuel. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> pounded each other's capitals and major cities with more than 300 missiles between Feb. 29 and April 21.

<HEAD>NASA Eyeing Aug. 25 For First Post-Challenger Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has set Aug. 25 as its internal target date for the first post-Challenger launch and administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> says the flight might not start until early September. `` Our expected plan is to fly in August,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` Whether it slops over into early September I think is not important. We will fly this summer.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had announced an August launch without a specific date, but internally the agency was working toward an Aug. 4 liftoff. That was pushed further along, to Aug. 13, by delays in assembling the booster rockets for the flight. Reporters pressed <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> on the date after his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> AIAA </ORGANIZATION> and he said officials were `` looking'' at Aug. 25 and into early September. `` We can expect to see Americans back in space,'' he told the industry meeting. `` The space shuttle's return to flight this year will signal the resurgence of the American space program and the beginning of a new era of discovery and commercial opportunity in space.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not had a manned flight since Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger blew up during liftoff, claiming the lives of its seven crew members. Because one of the boosters was at fault, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had the rocket completely redesigned and changed the way it is put together. The redesign took time and first-flight launch targets slipped from the summer of 1987 to February 1988 and then June 2, 1988. Late last year a component of the booster broke apart during a firing test and the August timeframe was announced. The complexities of the `` stacking'' _ putting the four fuel-filled segments of the booster together _ have been responsible for much of the latest delay. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told reporters that an official launch date probably wo n't be announced until after the next booster test, scheduled for June 9. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space flight, told another group of <ORGANIZATION> AIAA </ORGANIZATION> members that planning still was for an August launch. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> has insisted that the launch date would not be affected by the Aug. 15-18 Republican Natational Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, manager of shuttle operations at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said last week that if Discovery's launch slips past Aug. 31, the third flight _ another Discovery liftoff on Jan. 19, 1989 _ would have to be put off indefinitely. The same situation would apply if flight 27, scheduled for Oct. 27, is delayed past Nov. 17.

And there seems good reason for a scaling back in the commitment to a Star Wars system.

But finally, as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> made it known it is willing to give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> an exit that is both face-saving and asset-retaining, the out-of-towners have shown they've learned you do n't go setting foreign policy by mouthing off empty threats. ... _ First, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for drug trafficking That counterproductive move made it more difficult for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to retire to countries with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an extradition treaty. ... _ When threats of imprisonment did n't work with the dictator, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> switched to using economic sactions as a means of driving <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out All that did was incur the wrath of the Panamanian people. ... Would n't it make more sense to negotiate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of the drug trade than hunt him down in the sort of bloody vigilantism that so resembles <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adventurism of an earlier era?

But his effort at making analogies leaves us wondering if the locker room smell of sweatsocks is beginning to take its toll. On -LRB- an -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television special dealing with stress, correspondent <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> asked Knight how he handled stress. `` I think if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it,'' he said. Handle it, maybe. But enjoy it? We had hoped the age-old idea of putting rape and enjoyable in the same sentence was beginning to disappear, but obviously, that's not the case What's especially disappointing is to hear such comparisons made by <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, given his position as an educator and coach. Crimes of violence against women, such as rape, are constantly on the rise. The last thing we need now is some off-the-cuff basketball coach telling the nation's television viewers just to relax and enjoy it.

 May 1 The Journal Times, <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, on dial-a-porn: It appears the infamous 900-prefix telephone information services are n't the problem state authorities claim they are. According to <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, less than 1 percent of its southeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> customers have taken advantage of the free blocking service. ... The service would limit access to 900-prefix telephone numbers which offer various services, primarily information, for a fee. Complaints have been registered with utilities and government officials about abuse of two of those services. Specifically targeted are the so-called `` dial-a-porn'' services offering pornographic telephone conversations, and the teen `` party-line'' services which put teen-agers throughout the country in touch with each other. ... <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> got permission to offer a free service which would block access to those services in an effort to answer complaints. ... <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> officials report, however, that of 716,500 customers, only 2,908 have asked for the blocking service. One factor may be that the service not only blocks access to dial-a-porn and teen party lines, but to all other 900-prefix services as well. But we suspect the real explanation is that relatively few <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> customers use 900-prefix services at all, and of that number fewer still have problems with it.

 A woman who was a passenger on an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet shortly before a section of its fuselage tore away over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> said she saw the wall of the plane undulate during takeoff. `` As the plane was going up into the air I was resting my arm on the armrest and my arm started to slip towards the wall, so I took it away and I saw that the wall was moving in and out, like swaying in and out,'' <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, had been honeymooning in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and flew from the island of <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Thursday. She said she did n't realize the significance until after she heard that part of the jet's fuselage had blown away on a later flight Thursday. A flight attendant was killed and 61 of 89 passengers were injured. `` At the time my wife <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> was sitting near the window, I was sitting in the seat next to her and I had my head back and my eyes closed relaxing, so I did n't even notice this was happening,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said in an interview with television station <ORGANIZATION> WFSB-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The couple said they learned about the accident after they returned to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on Friday, but did n't realize they had been on the same plane until they saw a picture and recognized the name `` Queen <PERSON> Liliuokalani </PERSON>'' on the airliner's nose. They said they had been sitting four rows up from the wing in a section that later ripped away. Mrs. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said she called <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to tell them of her observation. Federal safety officials have ordered the oldest models of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners with more than 55,000 landings, like the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> airplane, not to fly higher than 23,000 feet while the accident is under investigation. Above 24,000 feet the difference between higher cabin pressure and lower atmospheric pressure could be sufficient to cause a hazard in aircraft where there could be a structural weakness, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said.

<TEXT>
 State prison administrators can cut an inmate's hair, even if he objects for religious reasons, because prison security outweighs an inmate's individual rights, a federal appeals court says. A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> unanimously rejected the argument of inmate <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Lucas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, that prison officials violated his constitutional right to exercise his religion when they cut his long hair. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, said Tuesday she had not seen the ruling and declined to comment or to say whether <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> will appeal. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s suit argued that his rights were violated because he adheres to the religion of the <ORGANIZATION> Lakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, who believe that hair is sacred and should not be cut. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, 31, is serving a 17 - to 45-year sentence for convictions of burglary, escape and bad-check offenses He has been an inmate since October 1981 at the state's maximum-security <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lucasville </LOCATION>. His legal battle with officials over haircuts has been ongoing since he got into the prison system. Prison officials said they have the right to cut prisoners' hair for a variety of security and identification reasons. They said prisoners could hide contraband, including keys and pills, in long hair, could cut it off after escaping to more easily avoid detection and could provoke homosexual attacks from other inmates attracted by the appearance of long hair. Prison officials also said long hair could hinder prison employees in identifying inmates, which could hamper roll calls, mail calls, issuing visitor passes and finding prisoners who break rules. Longer hair could also clog prison sink and shower drains and be more conducive to carrying lice and creating other sanitation problems, state officials contended. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> ruled in favor of the state, and <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> appealed. The appeals court panel upheld <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s decision on Monday. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Studer </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> attorney general representing the state, said the appeals court's ruling indicated that the courts are starting to defer to concerns of prison administrators faced with complex security problems in crowded penitentiaries.

<HEAD>FAA Expands Inspections Following Hawaiian Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> today widened its inspections of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners for possible cracking and corrosion in response to an accident last week in which a large section of one of the jets tore free during flight. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive requires operators of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s _ those with more than 30,000 flights _ to be visually inspected and to undergo sophisticated electronic inspections if cracks are found. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the agency's action stems from a belief that `` an abundance of caution'' is needed in light of the recent accident involving <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Last Thursday a 20-foot section of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 stretching from just behind the cockpit to near the wing tore loose as the jet was cruising at 24,000 feet. One flight attendant was swept from the plane and to her death and 61 people were injured, although the plane landed safely. The new inspection order covers 291 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s _ the first ones made in the late 1960s and early 1970s _ in which a `` cold bonding'' process was used to splice together sections of the plane's outer metal skin. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said he could not immediately say how many planes covered by the order were in operation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered many of the older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s to fly no higher than 23,000 feet and said that those with 55,000 landings should be visually inspected for corrosion or cracking. The order today expands the visual inspections to planes with at least 30,000 landings and requires those with 50,000 landings to undergo so-called `` eddy current'' inspections using high-frequency electronic devices. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that despite the increased focus on the older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s the aircraft `` are just as safe as newer models and if they were not they would n't be allowed to fly.'' He said while the cause of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident has yet to be determined `` it is time for an abundance of caution. And it is out of an abundance of caution that we take today's action.'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that he does not think the inspection requirements will disrupt air travel. Under the emergency <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive, visual inspections must be conducted within 250 landings. The airlines must report to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours on the result of the inspections. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 is widely used for short-haul flights and more than 1,100 of the 737-200 series, such as the one involved in the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, have been built. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> could not say which airlines fly the older 737s but said the planes are scattered across the industry.

<HEAD>Tass Makes Fun of Reagan over Astrology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> poked somewhat ponderous fun Wednesday at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reported faith in astrology, wondering in a dispatch what the stars are telling the leader of the West. `` It is difficult to say what the May night sky, studded with stars, predicted to the president, but it hardly predicted that he would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' the official news agency said. Recent reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> consult astrologers inspired taunts from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and criticism from scientists. Some reports said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, plans to say in a book that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to astrologers in shaping the president's schedule. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied having been swayed by the stars in making policy decisions, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> characterized his comments as evasive. `` When he appeared on Tuesday in one of the halls of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, reporters practically showered him with questions,'' the agency said. `` They wondered to what extent astrologers and fortune-tellers influenced him when he had to make political decisions. `` He was quick to answer, but he tried to escape from direct answers to further questions. All this has not clarified the questions raised, and now more Americans are asking themselves: May it be true that the president determines the country's political course with the help of the stars?''

<HEAD>Tests of Genetic Organisms Pose Little Risk, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulatory agencies soon should be able to ease up on reviews of applications to field-test genetically engineered organisms because the tests pose little risk, a research arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The agencies are piling up experience so rapidly that `` it should be possible now, or become possible in the near future, to sort planned introductions into broad categories for which low, medium or high levels of review are appropriate,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said in a report. So far, there have been about two dozen field tests of one kind or another in 12 states and four foreign countries, the study said. `` With adequate review, none of the small-scale field tests proposed or probable within the next several years -LRB- is -RRB- likely to result in an environmental problem that would be widespread or difficult to control,'' it said. In agriculture, a new crop strain or rotation probably could ease or control damage _ if any _ from experiments gone awry, the report said. A worst-case outcome, the authors wrote, would appear to be `` to disrupt a fundamental ecosystem process, for example, the cycling of a mineral or a nutrient, or the flow of energy in an ecosystem. Such disruptions are not, however, among the credible consequences of any introduction that seems likely within the next several years.'' Such disruptions could be `` difficult to control and far-reaching in their effects,'' and are conceivable as the result of releasing a new microbe with enhanced ability to degrade toxic waste or cellulose, the report said. Many species perform the same functions in an ecosystem, and this redundancy, coupled with the resilience of ecosystems, `` are persuasive arguments against the likelihood of such consequences.'' Crop plants and domestic livestock appear to pose the least risk from genetic engineering techniques, the report said in suggesting points regulators might consider in deciding where to loosen scrutiny. Examples of such criteria include whether the new organism is changed in its structural or regulatory genes. Regulatory genes deserve more attention, the report said, because they govern how much product a cell makes through its structural genes and this could enhance survivability or vulnerability in the environment. Another example might be the deletion of genes, which the report said probably do n't need as much review as the insertion of genes. Deletions are far more common in nature than insertions. `` Although the characteristics of engineered organisms make certain kinds less likely than others to cause problems, it is not now possible to describe any broad categories thay could be completely exempted from review,'' the report cautioned. `` Counterexamples can be provided from existing experience to negate almost any proposed category for exemption from review.'' The new `` recombinant'' techniques of genetic engineering that make possible the insertion of a gene from one species into the DNA, the genetic material, of another have prompted research aimed at making, among other things: _ Plants that can resist pests, pesticides, or diseases; use fertilizers better or perhaps do without them _ Bacteria that can confer frost resistance on plants _ New animal vaccines _ Animals with greater meat or milk production _ Microbes that can digest toxic waste better than existing strains or even concentrate metallic ores `` It is important to note that modifying organisms for specific human ends is not new,'' the technology assessment office said. `` Selective breeders of plants and animals have been transferring genes for millenia, often creating forms through centuries of selection that differ from their original stocks more than the forms produced by recombinant DNA methods.''

 A prominent <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> lawyer said to be Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s latest choice to become his chief deputy is undergoing a background check, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> confirmed today. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, briefing reporters on Air Force One as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to deliver a speech, would not say if the attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is the only candidate for the job. `` We are reviewing a number of candidates, doing background checks, but ca n't confirm anyone'' as being the only candidate for a specific job, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, noting, `` There are several candidates for positions at Justice.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was questioned about a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, 62, was the third person picked to fill the vacancy. The Post, quoting unidentified administration sources, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> sent the <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> recommendation to the White House on Monday, but was waiting until the background check is completed before making an announcement. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> could not be reached for comment, but Republican Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that he had proposed <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>'s name to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` It still has to go through a process ...

The job became vacant after the protest resignation March 29 of <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned in the wake of continuing investigations of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>.

<HEAD>How Do You Get AIDS from Sex?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The AIDS virus can be spread by sexual intercourse whether you are male or female, heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual. This happens because a person infected with the AIDS virus may have the virus in semen or vaginal fluids. The virus can enter the body through the vagina, penis, rectum or mouth. Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky. The rectum is easily injured during anal intercourse. Remember, AIDS is sexually transmitted, and the AIDS virus is not the only infection that is passed through intimate sexual contact. Other sexual transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes and chlamydia, can also be contracted through oral, anal and vaginal intercourse. If you are infected with one of these diseases and engage in risky behavior you are at greater risk of getting AIDS.

<HEAD>You Won't Get AIDS From Insects _ Or A Kiss</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 No matter what you may have heard, the AIDS virus is hard to get and is easily avoided. You wo n't just `` catch'' AIDS like a cold or flu because the virus is a different type. The AIDS virus is transmitted through sexual intercourse, the sharing of drug needles, or to babies of infected mothers before or during birth. You wo n't get the AIDS virus through everyday contact with the people around you in school, in the workplace, at parties, child care centers, or stores. You wo n't get it by swimming in a pool, even if someone in the pool is infected with the AIDS virus. Students attending school with someone infected with the AIDS virus are not in danger from casual contact. You wo n't get AIDS from a mosquito bite. The AIDS virus is not transmitted through a mosquito's salivary glands like other diseases such as malaria or yellow fever. You wo n't get it from bed bugs, lice, flies or other insects, either. You wo n't get AIDS from saliva, sweat, tears, urine or a bowel movement. You wo n't get AIDS from a kiss. You wo n't get AIDS from clothes, a telephone, or from a toilet seat. It ca n't be passed by using a glass or eating utensils that someone else has used. You wo n't get the virus by being on a bus, train or crowded elevator with a person who is infected with the virus, or who has AIDS.

<HEAD>What Behavior Puts You At Risk?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 You are at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus if you have sex with someone who is infected, or if you share drug needles and syringes with someone who is infected. Since you ca n't be sure who is infected, your chances of coming into contact with the virus increase with the number of sex partners you have. Any exchange of infected blood, semen or vaginal fluids can spread the virus and place you at great risk. The following behaviors are risky when performed with an infected person. You ca n't tell by looking if a person is infected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>Risky Behavior</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Sharing drug needles and syringes. Anal sex, with or without a condom. Vaginal or oral sex with someone who shoots drugs or engages in anal sex. Sex with someone you do n't know well -LRB- a pickup or prostitute -RRB- or with someone you know has several sex partners. Unprotected sex -LRB- without a condom -RRB- with an infected person.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>Safe Behavior</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Not having sex. Sex with one mutually faithful, uninfected partner. Not shooting drugs.

<HEAD>What About Dating?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Dating and getting to know other people is a normal part of life. Dating does n't mean the same thing as having sex. Sexual intercourse as a part of dating can be risky. One of the risks is AIDS. How can you tell if someone you're dating or would like to date has been exposed to the AIDS virus? The bad news is, you ca n't. But the good news is, as long as sexual activity and sharing drug needles are avoided, it does n't matter. You are going to have to be careful about the person you become sexually involved with, making your own decision based on your own best judgment. That can be difficult. Has this person had any sexually transmitted diseases? How many people have they been to bed with? Have they experimented with drugs? All these are sensitive, but important, questions. But you have a personal responsibility to ask. Think of it this way. If you know someone well enough to have sex, then you should be able to talk about AIDS. If someone is unwilling to talk, you should n't have sex.

<HEAD>Do Married People Get AIDS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Married people who are uninfected, faithful and do n't shoot drugs are not at risk. But if they engage in risky behavior, they can become infected with the AIDS virus and infect their partners. If you feel your spouse may be putting you at risk, talk to him or her. It's your life.

 Thousands of illegal aliens hoping to take advantage of their last chance for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship camped outside immigration offices around the country early today as the yearlong amnesty program approached its midnight deadline. All 107 offices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will remain open until midnight to handle applicatons from those seeking legal residency status. `` I expect to be here forever, for the rest of my life,'' said a weary <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chief legalization officer for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, vendors sold tacos and sandwiches to those in line Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, immigration officials hired a Mexican band to entertain the 400 people queued up. `` I think we burned out two photocopiers in the past two days,'' said <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Parilli </PERSON>, director of the legalization program at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where more than 25,000 aliens from 200 countries have applied for amnesty in the past year. As of Monday, 1.37 million amnesty applications had been filed nationwide, and 470,000 people were seeking legal status under a separate program for seasonal agricultural workers, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said. The deadline for that program is Nov. 30. Applicants who file by the deadline also may request up to 60 days for submitting other documents necessary to prove they have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, the midnight deadline was extended for some aliens until at least May 16 because of initial confusion about the program's application to parents of U.S.-born children on welfare. They were first ruled ineligible, then eligible for amnesty. Today's order by the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> applies only in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, and <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said it would affect only a few hundred families. He urged all eligible aliens not to wait, but to apply by midnight anyway. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 2,000 people applied for amnesty on Monday and nearly as many applied on Tuesday, said legalization officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Newland </PERSON>. `` I think many of these people deep down inside thought there would be an extension, so they waited until the last minute,'' <PERSON> Newland </PERSON> said. By Monday, 1.33 million people had applied for some form of amnesty in the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> western region, said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, the region's acting assistant director of immigration reform The region is comprised of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. Thousands of amnesty applications piled up in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, the region's busiest, as people camped outside. More than 13,000 illegal aliens have applied for amnesty in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said A.J. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> chief legalization officer in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. About 1,000 people have applied in the last week, and about 50 were waiting outside the doors when the office opened Tuesday. `` We just ca n't handle it,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. `` We were doing an average of 20 people a day, and now we're doing about 200 a day.'' `` I asked them -LRB- the aliens -RRB-, ` Why did you wait, why did you wait,' and a lot are saying they were afraid to come in,'' he said. `` Now after a year, they're seeing that it's not a trick.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, 40, was among the skeptics. `` I thought I would go to the immigration office to apply and they would be there waiting to catch us,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. `` I did n't have sufficient papers, and I was n't certain about the program like I am now,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, 37, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` And I did n't have the money.'' In <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellon </PERSON>, 40, said he had been afraid to apply. `` I was afraid they would deport me,'' <PERSON> Castellon </PERSON> said. `` But now everyone believes in the law, and they accept it in good faith.'' In <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, chief legalization officer <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Botts </PERSON> said he found a block-long line upon opening Tuesday, and 900 people were processed during the day. `` We had another rough one today,'' Botts said, with waits of about four hours for applicants, `` which before this week was unheard of.'' In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the legalization office stayed open during the final 24 hours of the application period. On Tuesday, 5,000 people tried to apply, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, the center's director. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials rented three portable toilets to accommodate people camping outside the legalization center, and vendors sold refreshments. `` Some of the applicants are free-enterprising, selling tacos, Cokes, salad, sandwiches,'' <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said, joking that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> approves of the entrepreneurs `` as long as they are reporting that income.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, officials expected the total number of amnesty applications to reach 125,000 by tonight, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> regional director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. `` I think there may be a last-minute push,'' he said. `` But we'll take everyone _ even if we have to wake'em up in line.'' About 23,000 people have applied for amnesty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, with 25 percent coming in the last month, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, director of the immigration office in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. `` It's been a very successful program but I am disappointed in this particular area that there are an awful lot of aliens who have not taken advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime chance,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` There are no more chances,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` An awful lot of people are missing the boat.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident took issue with the government's modernization plans during a meeting Wednesday with university students and said economic reform without democracy is impossible. `` The concept of modernization is independent of nation or local people,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> told the students at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a common concept all over the world. You should not be able to say ` Chinese modernization.' The aim, the target, at least, is the same everywhere.'' Chinese leaders use the slogan `` modernization with Chinese characteristics'' to describe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of economic reform under party direction. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, 52, an internationally respected astrophysicist, is an outspoken critic of the government and was kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last year. He was accused of inciting pro-democracy student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987. His meeting with several hundred students during an observance of the university's 90th anniversary was believed to be the first time since his dismissal that <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was allowed to speak about politics in public. `` We need more democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said after the meeting. Developing a modern economy without democracy is impossible, he said, offering <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> as an example of a nation where `` there is no democracy and also no economy.'' He said students had n't abandoned their hopes for democracy. `` The students still are concerned about the situation of democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now,'' he said. `` After the student movement, of course, they kept quiet, but in their minds they want quicker -LRB- steps toward democracy -RRB-.'' Of the students' thinking, he said: `` No change. Still no change.'' He said of his own: `` I never change my opinion'' on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s politics or economy. After the student protests, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was removed as vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hefei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province, and was transferred to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION>, where he continues research and writing. The official press has featured him in several articles recently in an attempt to show government leniency in allowing <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to continue his academic pursuits. He was allowed to attend a conference in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> last June. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> published a lengthy feature saying the past year, during which <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> published five books, was his most productive. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said Wednesday he would admit to error in his thinking only if the government could prove him wrong.

 A federal appeals court today extended the midnight deadline for the government's illegal alien amnesty program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, giving many aliens with U.S.-born children on welfare another two weeks to register. The state has been seeking a 60-day extension and the court's order will apply until another hearing the week of May 16, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state attorney general's The amnesty program allows illegal aliens who have lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for legal status and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. The deadline runs out at midnight tonight, but <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state asked for the extension because there was initial confusion about the program's application to parents of U.S.-born children on welfare. The order by the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> applies only to the illegal alien program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. It was not immediately determined whether it would apply to all aliens or only those with U.S.-born children. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> urged those eligible for legalization to apply by midnight tonight `` as it is not clear what the impact of this order may be.'' The court told lawyers for the state and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to work out specifics of the order, including which illegal aliens would be affected, <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> said. If the sides could not agree on an order this afternoon the court said it would issue its own order, he said. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he understood that any order `` will only apply to a limited class of people ... who may be ineligible for amnesty because their children have received <ORGANIZATION> AFDC </ORGANIZATION> benefits.'' The action may only affect several hundred people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> said. The issue arose because aliens who are likely to need public assistance, such as welfare, are among those who can not be accepted in the amnesty program. The state asked whether poor illegal aliens with U.S.-born children who receive welfare in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program can qualify for amnesty. Technically the children are the welfare recipients, because they are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> said there are `` a lot'' of such families, but he had no count. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> initially said the parents of such children would not be eligible, then said they would be eligible, <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> said. Because of the confusion, the state sued the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> for a 60-day extension of the deadline and a $ 100,000 advertising campaign explaining the policy. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> cautioned that illegal aliens not involved in the litigation should apply by tonight's midnight deadline. `` INS strongly urges anyone eligible for amnesty to apply by midnight tonight as this is the deadline for virtually all potential applicants,'' he said. `` It would be tragic for people who are eligible for this program not to come forward by midnight on the basis of misinformation.''

<HEAD>What Is All The Talk About Condoms?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Not so very long ago, condoms -LRB- rubbers or prophylactics -RRB- were things we did n't talk about very much. Now, they're discussed on the evening news and on the front page of your newspaper, and displayed out in the open in your local drug store, grocery and convenience store. For those who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual activity to one partner, condoms have been shown to help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That is why the use of condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of AIDS. Condoms are the best preventive measure against AIDS besides not having sex and practicing safe behavior. But condoms are far from being foolproof. You have to use them properly. And you have to use them every time you have sex, from start to finish. If you use a condom, you should remember these guidelines: -LRB- 1 -RRB- Use condoms made of latex rubber. Latex serves as a barrier to the virus. `` Lambskin'' or `` natural membrane'' condoms are not as good because of the pores in the material. Look for the word `` latex'' on the package. -LRB- 2 -RRB- A condom with a spermicide may provide additional protection. Spermicides have been shown in laboratory tests to kill the virus. Use the spermicide in the tip and outside the condom. -LRB- 3 -RRB- Condom use is safer with a lubricant. Check the list of ingredients on the back of the lubricant package to make sure the lubricant is water-based. Do not use petroleum-based jelly, cold cream, baby oil or cooking shortening. These can weaken the condom and cause it to break.

<HEAD>What Does Someone With AIDS Look Like?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 It is very important that everyone understands that a person can be infected with the AIDS virus without showing any symptoms at all. It is possible to be infected for years, feel fine, look fine and have no way of knowing you are infected unless you have a test for the AIDS virus. During this period, however, people infected with the AIDS virus can pass the virus to sexual partners, to people with whom drug needles are shared, and to children before or during birth. That is one of the most disturbing things about AIDS. Once symptoms do appear, they are similar to the symptoms of some other diseases. As the disease progresses, they become more serious. That is because the AIDS virus keeps your body's natural defenses from operating correctly. If you are concerned whether you might be infected, consider your own behavior and its effects on others. If you feel you need to be tested for the AIDS virus, talk to a doctor or an AIDS counselor for more information. -LRB- See below. -RRB-

<HEAD>Is There A Cure For AIDS?
   There is presently no cure for AIDS.
   Medicines such as AZT have prolonged the lives of some people
with AIDS. There is hope that additional treatments will be found.
   There is also no vaccine to prevent uninfected people from
getting the infection. Researchers believe it may take years for an
effective, safe vaccine to be found.
   The most effective way to prevent AIDS is avoiding exposure to
the virus, which you can control by your own behavior.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Should you Get An AIDS Test?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 You have probably heard about the `` AIDS Test.'' the test does n't actually tell you if you have AIDS. It shows if you have been infected with the virus. It looks for changes in blood that occur after you have been infected. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recommends you be confidentially counseled and tested if you have had any sexually transmitted disease or shared needles; if you are a man who has had sex with another man; or if you have had sex with a prostitute, male or female. You should be tested if you have had sex with anyone who has done any of these things. If you are a woman who has been engaging in risky behavior and you plan to have a baby or are not using birth control, you should be tested. Your doctor may advise you to be counseled and tested if you are a hemophiliac, or have received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985. If you test positive, and find you have been infected with the AIDS virus, you must take steps to protect your partner. People who have always practiced safe behavior do not need to be tested. There's been a great deal in the press about problems with the test. It is very reliable if it is done by a good laboratory and the results are checked by a physician or counselor. If you have engaged in risky behavior, speak frankly to a doctor who understands the AIDS problem, or to an AIDS counselor. For more nformation, call your local public health agency. They're listed in the government section of your phone book. Or, call your local AIDS hotline. If you ca n't find the number, call 1-800-342-AIDS.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> in an interview published Wednesday called for an Arab-Israeli peace settlement entailing a jointly run Jordanian-Palestinian state in 60 percent of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He said his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which shares power with the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> in a coalition, insisted that `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> must be united under <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sovereignty and remain its capital.'' The Jordanian-Palestinian state had to be `` under one sovereignty, one government, one flag and one capital _ <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense Weekly. He did n't say whether the sovereignty should be Jordanian or Palestinian. <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> is the capital of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> ruled out <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal to its pre-1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war borders, saying changes must be made `` to be included under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s sovereignty.'' Also, he said, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> insisted on a `` defense line'' along the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which would effectively leave the rest of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> sandwiched between the Israeli army and the territory of pre-1967 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said this meant 60 percent of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would be part of the <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> state. `` To maintain <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state and a democracy ... means not allowing a situation to develop where a considerable part of its citizens will be non-Jewish,'' he said. `` We can not have 35-40 percent of the population Palestinians who entertain civil rights. On the other hand, we can not have a state in which there are no equal rights to every citizen,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. In combating the 5-month-old wave of Palestinian unrest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, he said, `` The political guideline is not to allow violence to gain the upper hand. ... It will achieve nothing.'' He declined to deny or confirm reports that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have jointly developed missiles, saying <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy was to withhold comment on arms deals. `` I will not give you a clearcut answer, but by saying so, I am not confirming anything about the relations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> People </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. He expressed concern about the appearance of ground-to-ground missiles and chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> arena. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> warned of a `` very, very severe'' response if the Arabs used chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Syndicated stargazers say it was an open secret that President and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consult their horoscopes, with their interest in astrology dating to the years when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The White House confirmed Tuesday that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> follows astrology and consults it for some of the president's activities, but the president said no policy or decision he's made has been influenced by the stars. `` I refer to it as the world's worst-kept secret that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> relies on astrology. There's nothing new about it,'' said astrologer <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Omarr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, whose syndicated daily horoscope is distributed to more than 300 newspapers, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Omarr </PERSON> said he has never consulted with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but received congratulations via a phone call from former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> when <PERSON> Omarr </PERSON> noted his 25 years with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times syndicate. `` <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> relied on astrology. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> did. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s diary said he kept track of the position of the stars,'' <PERSON> Omarr </PERSON> said. The confirmation of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' interest followed reports that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, plans to reveal in a book that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned to astrologers in shaping the president's schedule. `` It's an input that they receive. I do n't like to use the word rely,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>, an astrologer from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> whose daily horoscope is distributed to more than 100 newspapers nationwide by <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning'' show today, Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said she was not surprised at the sudden controversy over the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' interest in astrology. `` This has been sort of in the offing for the last two weeks... I have been hearing rumblings about this through various channels,'' she said. `` I think they handled it beautifully. And frankly I think <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who is a Sagitarrius, tried to use this to get much more attention than it really got.'' The question of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and astrology surfaced more than 20 years ago, when he chose to be sworn in as governor for his first term shortly after midnight on Jan. 5, 1967. Outgoing Gov. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> picked the time because he relied on astrology. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s aides denied that, and said the unusual time was picked because of constitutional questions regarding transfer of power. Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> regularly consulted astrologers throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency and gubernatorial tenure in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political aide and longtime associate of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed the sudden interest in Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stargazing. `` I have never once heard her allude to astrology or to the stars or to the moon or to the sign of the ram,'' he said. He said the president liked to read his horoscope and `` laughed about it and kidded about it, but I have never seen him take the stuff seriously.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said she was at the White House after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assassination attempt in March 1981, and helped the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> choose <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president `` There was talk that I did charts for all eight -LRB- vice presidential -RRB- candidates. I do n't deny that. I determined the only winnable choice was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Asked if she advised the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said, `` I never discuss my clients.'' She said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has used astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events. `` Look at when he holds his news conferences. They're usually during a full moon. He chooses those times to do it.'' However, White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> did not know Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with <PERSON> Reagn </PERSON> on Air Force One to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said today that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> was `` crazy for trying to fabricate a White House relationship that does n't exist.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in the stars was renewed after her husband survived the assassination attempt, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s charts indicated danger for that time, and he should have been more cautious. She added astrology was used in planning last December's summit between the president and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but things did n't go smoothly with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> because the Soviet leader's wife's birthdate is not known in the West. `` The problem with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> would never have happened if we had her birthdate,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said one of the astrologers that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted was <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Righter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, who was mentioned in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1965 autobiography, `` Where's The Rest Of Me?'' <PERSON> Righter </PERSON> died Saturday at age 88.

<HEAD>The Problem Of Drugs And AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Today, in some cities, the sharing of drug needles and syringes by those who shoot drugs is the fastest growing way that the virus is being spread. No one should shoot drugs. It can result in addiction, poor health, family disruption, emotional disturbances and death. Many drug users are addicted and need to enter a drug treatment program as quickly as possible. In the meantime, these people must avoid AIDS by not sharing any of the equipment used to prepare and inject illegal drugs. Sharing drug needles, even once, is an extremely easy way to be infected with the AIDS virus. Blood from an infected person can be trapped in the needle or syringe, and then injected directly into the bloodstream of the next person who uses the needle. Other kinds of drugs, including alcohol, can also cause problems. Under their influence, your judgment becomes impaired. You could be exposed to the AIDS virus while doing things you would n't otherwise do. Teen-agers are at an age when trying different things is especially inviting. They must understand how serious the drug problem is and how to avoid it. Drugs are also one of the main ways in which prostitutes become infected. They may share needles themselves or have sex with people who do. They then can pass the AIDS virus to others. For information about drug abuse treatment programs, contact your physician, local public health agency or community AIDS or drug assistance group.

<HEAD>AIDS And Babies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 An infected woman can give the AIDS virus to her baby before it is born, or during birth. If a woman is infected, her child has about one chance in two of being born with the virus. If you are considering having a baby, and think you might have been at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus, even if it was years ago, you should receive counseling and be tested before you get pregnant. You must have a long talk with the person with whom you're planning to have a child Even if you have known this person for a long time, there's no way to be sure he or she has n't been infected in the past, possibly without realizing it. That person needs to think hard and decide if an AIDS test might be a good idea. So should you.

<HEAD>Talking With Kids About AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Children hear about AIDS, just as we all do. But they do n't understand it, so they become frightened They are worried they or their friends might get sick and die. Children need to be told they ca n't get AIDS from everyday contact in the classroom, cafeteria or bathrooms. They do n't have to worry about getting AIDS even if one of their school-mates is infected. Basic health education should be started as early as possible, in keeping with parental and community standards. Local schools have the responsibility to see that their students know the facts about AIDS. It is very important that middle school students _ those entering their teens _ learn to protect themselves from the AIDS virus. Children must also be taught values and responsibility, as well as skills to help them resist peer pressure that might lead to risky behavior. These skills can be reinforced by religious and community groups. However, final responsibility rests with the parents. As a parent, you should read and discuss this brochure with your children.

<HEAD>Helping A Person With AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 If you are one of the growing number of people who know someone who is infected, you need to have a special understanding of the problem. No one will require more support and more love than your friend with AIDS. Feel free to offer what you can, without fear of becoming infected. Do n't worry about getting AIDS from everyday contact with a person with AIDS. You need to take precautions such as wearing rubber gloves only when blood is present. If you do n't know anyone with AIDS, but you'd still like to offer a helping hand, become a volunteer. You can be sure your help will be appreciated by a person with AIDS. This might mean dropping by the supermarket to pick up groceries, sitting with the person a while, or just being there to talk. You may even want to enroll in a support group for caregivers. These are available around the country. If you are interested, contact any local AIDS-related organization. Above all, keep an upbeat attitude. It will help you and everyone face the disease more comfortably.

 The Sandinista government said today it ordered a privately owned radio station off the air for a day and temporarily barred two others from broadcasting news programs because of their reports on a workers' hunger strike. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ministry on Tuesday night ordered <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporacion </ORGANIZATION> to immediately suspend service for 24 hours. The ministry had earlier said the suspension would last eight days. The official said <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION> were prohibited from broadcasting their regular news programs for eight days. They can appeal the order. Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the radio stations were accused of `` spreading false information'' about a workers' hunger strike and with violating laws preserving public order. Radio <PERSON> Catolica </PERSON> was shut down in January 1986 after it failed to broadcast President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s end-of-the-year message. It was allowed to resume operations last fall under provisions of a regional peace plan signed in August by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of four other Central American countries. More than 30 construction workers and car mechanics are in the ninth day of their hunger strike to demand higher pay. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osejo </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporacion </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly was punched in the mouth by Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> last week because the station broadcast what <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said was incorrect information about the fast. Barricada reported the altercation. Police have taken at least 40 people into custody during the past week in connection with the hunger strike. The fasting workers are staying at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of socialist anti-government unions. About 1,500 construction workers and auto mechanics walked off the job in late February, demanding higher pay and better working conditions. The wildcat strikes are an embarrassment to the leftist government. Such strikes were illegal for almost six years under a state of emergency that was lifted in January, again as part of the regional peace plan. Rebels known as Contras have been fighting the Sandinista government since November 1981. The regional peace plan is aimed at ending the Contra insurgency and at halting rebellions in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Number of Itemizers Dropped 15 Percent, IRS Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Johnell correct in 3rd graf, bgng ``About 31''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The scaling back of some favorite deductions under the new tax law reduced the number of itemizing taxpayers by 15 percent this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. And despite the major changes and a confusing W-4 withholding form, the number of taxpayers receiving refunds this year is up slightly over 1987, the tax agency reported. About 31 million _ 51 percent _ of the 60.9 million long tax forms received through April 22 itemized deductions, said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Johnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. At the same time last year, 36.4 million _ 60 percent _ of 60.3 million long forms included itemized deductions. The drop comes as no surprise. Reducing the number of itemizers was a major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul; in fact, the reduction was the largest element of simplification in the big package. In addition to cutting tax rates and boosting the personal exemption, the new law _ which was reflected for the first time on returns filed this year _ eliminated the deduction for state and local sales taxes and limited writeoffs for consumer interest, medical expenses and such miscellaneous expenses as union dues. The combination of a higher standard deduction and a smaller total of itemized deductions made it beneficial for those 5.4 million taxpayers to stop itemizing. By the time the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> counts all the returns filed this year, the number switching to the standard deduction will be even higher. The number of taxpayers receiving refunds is up 0.3 percent, to 55.5 million. That means about 79.5 percent of filers are getting refunds. `` Apparently withholding was more in line with tax liability than we had been expecting,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. Other statistics released by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday also indicate that taxpayers may not have had as much trouble understanding the new law and revised tax forms as some experts had predicted. For example: _ Fewer taxpayers asked the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to fill out their returns, about 625,000 this year compared with 770,000 last year _ Although the number who hired professionals to prepare their returns rose to 44.5 million -LRB- 47 percent -RRB- from 42.7 million -LRB- 45 percent -RRB-, the increase was less than forecast _ Through April 29, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 4.76 million requests for four-month extensions of the April 15 filing deadline Although this was more than the 4.37 million at the same time last year, again the growth was less than anticipated. For reasons that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can not explain, changes in the number of taxpayers seeking extensions varied sharply from region to region. For example, the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> service center, which processes returns from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, reported requests for extensions were almost 29 percent below last year. <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, which serves <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, showed a 47 percent drop in extensions. Through Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 98.6 million returns, a 2 percent increase over the 96.7 million filed in the same period in 1987. Before the year is out, the agency anticipates 107.6 million total filings, compared with 104 million last year. Some other statistics from this year's filing season:

<TEXT>
 _ The number of taxpayers claiming deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts dropped dramatically Last year, when all wage earners were eligible to make deductible contributions to an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, 14.6 million did so. This year, with deductible IRAs denied middle-and upper-income workers covered by company pensions, 5.7 million deducted their full contribution and 1 million claimed a partial deduction. _ The average refund this year is $ 850, up less than $ 2 from last year _ Through April 29, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had processed 69.9 million returns, down 0.2 percent from 70 million in 1987 _ 11.8 million returns were prepared on home computers before being mailed Some 600,000 others were prepared by professionals and filed via computer. _ Despite a lingering rumor that doing so makes it easier to be fingered for an audit, the number of taxpayers who used the official peel-off, stick-on label rose this year About 52.6 million peeled off and stuck on, compared with 52.2 million last year.

 The owner of a nursing home where six people died in a Christmas Eve fire has been charged with setting the blaze, police said. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, 49, was arrested Tuesday shortly after a <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted him on six counts of murder and one count of aggravated arson. `` This is silly,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>, owned the J.D. Residential Home for the Aged, which was destroyed in a fire Dec. 24, 1986. `` The way I feel, it's like something has been lifted off my chest,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who with her husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, was an administrator at the home. Mrs. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> has maintained a resident initially blamed with accidentally starting the fire could not have done so. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Parkers </ORGANIZATION>' sons, 16-year-old <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, died in the fire. When the initial investigation was conducted, fire officials said they believed an elderly, slightly retarded man given to playing with cigarette lighters started the blaze in his room and then panicked. But the <ORGANIZATION> Parkers </ORGANIZATION> said the flints had been removed from the man's lighters as a precaution District Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottoms </PERSON> refused comment on his investigation of the fire, citing a past legal relationship with <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. He also ordered investigators not to comment. Arraignment was scheduled Monday. If convicted, he could receive the death penalty.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> violated a White House ban on intervening in government contracts on behalf of friends when he tried to help the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee report concludes. The report, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee staff members, says that while <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was counselor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981 and 1982, he violated the policy despite warnings by White House officials not to intervene. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> responded to 16 memos written by his longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> by directing <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the company's efforts to obtain a $ 32 million no-bid engine contract. The company was awarded the contract after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, intervened in the spring of 1982, calling a crucial White House meeting at which officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives worked out their differences over price and the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to contribute millions of dollars in advance payments and loans to assist the company `` Former Counselor to the President <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and former Deputy Counselor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> failed to observe the White House policy on contacts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the report said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staffers. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, disputed the findings reached by all nine Republicans and Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chaired by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions did n't give the appearance of impropriety and did not fall within the scope of the White House <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said the White House policy was designed to prohibit a White House official from intervening at the request of a friend who was asking that a certain company be awarded a contract. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said that in this instance, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was simply trying to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was treated fairly when it was considered for the contract. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that `` obviously, no member of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend, or business associate has a financial interest.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielding </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former counsel, told the subcommittee staff that he advised <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s office on two occasions not to intervene on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> defense contracting firm that was seeking government business. Fielding said he stated that `` this is a government procurement situation. The White House should not be involved. There should n't even be the appearance of White House involvement. The <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> report was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former financial adviser, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, face trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges that include accepting funds to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. The subcommittee cited testimony from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials that the effort to help <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was based on the president's campaign promise to bring jobs and industry to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, where the defense contractor was located. `` The intervention of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ... appears to go beyond this purpose and to have been due in no small part to the influence of <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION> consultants and personal friends <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>,'' said the report, according to the staffers. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was then known as <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former political director, was convicted in Feburary of illegally lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>

 The top political and military leadership of the Nicaraguan Contras visited the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and said a deep split in the rebels' top ranks was being patched up. `` We have a Democratic organization,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, commander of the rebel forces. `` We have a right to dissent, and the organization has the mechanism to solve any kind of problem.'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, one of five members of the Contra directorate and a rival of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, replied when asked whether the rebels were unified, `` Yes, sure we are. We're all here.'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> vowed to stay on as military commander despite efforts to oust him. He joined <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and four other members of the directorate for a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking only on condition they not be named, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made general statements to the group stressing the need for a unified front against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. As recently as last week <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> was reported to have described <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> as the rebels' `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' a reference to the embattled commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Two weeks ago <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> led a move in the directorate to oust <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> but the bid was blocked by two other members, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, the senior member of the directorate, is said to believe that <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, in violation of the concept of civilian supremacy, had sought to wrest control of the movement. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions that a petition demanding <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s removal and signed by 49 rebel commanders is to be presented to the civilian directorate. But <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said there were only about half a dozen regional commanders opposed to him out of a total of more than 300. `` It is not a majority,'' he said. `` If only a few commanders dissent, it's acceptable.'' The rebels briefed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on a meeting they had last week with Sandinista leaders in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Virtually no progress was made on the goal of reaching a permanent cease-fire and an overall settlement of the country's six-year civil conflict <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the rebels were unified in support of the temporary cease-fire signed between the combatants last March 23 at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, another member of the directorate, joined <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> in blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for the the lack of progress. `` Our demands are reasonable. The Sandinista position has been a stumbling block,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said, `` We're all standing behind <PERSON> Sapoa </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Conservatives Face Tough Battle In Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government, hurt in opinion polls by fierce opposition to welfare shake-ups and a new property tax, faces a tough battle in municipal elections Thursday. The local contests, ranging from the big industrial cities of the north to town councils in the prosperous south, are the first electoral test of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government since she won a third successive in June. The opposition socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ended an upbeat campaign buoyed by revolts among rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> members of Parliament against the tax and welfare changes, which critics say will hurt the poor. `` The political contours of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are shifting before our eyes,'' Labor campaign manager <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> declared as the party hit a seven-year high of support. Labor support has surged from the 30.8 percent in the 1987 general election. The Conservatives won that vote with 42.3 percent of the vote. This month's Gallup poll indicated 41.5 percent support for Labor, one point ahead of the Conservatives. At stake are one-third of the seats in 158 English and Welsh districts and the entire councils of all 53 cities and towns of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. There are no elections this year in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Among the biggest prizes are <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s second largest city, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, the Scottish capital, and the southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, all narrowly controlled by Labor. Twenty million Britons are eligible to vote in the elections to fill nearly 4,000 seats last contested in 1984. About 10,800 candidates are running. In the pre-election battle, opposition parties have attacked the government's proposed welfare changes, which are aimed at ending what the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> call <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s `` dependency culture'' nurtured by the welfare state. The opposition has also criticized the new property tax legislation _ the latest <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> salvo in its battle to clip high-spending, left-wing local authorities. Under the changed laws, which are getting a rough ride through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, property taxes will be levied on every adult in a home, instead of on the building. Critics say the so-called `` poll tax'' will double or triple bills for millions of households. A rough calculation shows that a four-adult family in a middle-class <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb, which used to pay $ 930 a year on its house, will now pay $ 370 per head for a total of $ 1,480. But the figures vary and are disputed. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> calls the new tax a `` community charge,'' insisting `` poll tax'' is pejorative because it falsely implies that citizens will have to pay for their voting rights. Her 101-seat overall majority in the 650-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> was slashed to 25 this month in a vote on the bill. Surveys show two-thirds of voters oppose the tax. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argues that left-wing councils run costly policies geared to their own low-income supporters, and finance them by placing the main tax burden on the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>' constituency _ businesses and middle-class households. When the tax comes into force in 1990, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> believes, it will bring home to everyone, rich and poor, the cost of electing left-wing councils. The councils, which run services ranging from education to garbage collection, raise half their revenue from property taxes. The government provides the other half. In an added boost for Labor, the elections are also the first since <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two centrist parties merged last March into the new Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The new party, known as the Democrats, and a breakway <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by former foreign secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, are fighting each other for about 150 seats. The Gallup poll indicated 11 percent support for the Democrats and 4 percent for <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s breakaway faction. In <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> suffered humiliation at the last election when they won only 10 of the 72 Scottish parliamentary seats, the territory looks even more hostile to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Polls indicated 23 percent support there for the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>, compared with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 50 percent and 18 percent for Scottish nationalists.

 Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, saying federal restrictions on <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> finances are `` absurd,'' called Wednesday for more control over his budget as one way to avoid an accelerating pace forreases further,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who took over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> just weeks before last month's postal rate increase. `` I believe that the American people are not going to be happy forever with an inexorable cycle of rate increases every third year.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> testified at a hearing of two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees, at which one congressman said talk of inevitable rate increases is `` in and of itself negativism.'' Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to lower rates instead, saying `` even if it's just one cent, I think it could be a tremendous step forward.'' But the postmaster general said that `` over the next several years, we need to improve our situation just to continue to meet'' the past schedule of rate boosts roughly every three years. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> needs more control over its budget, hopes to find new sources of revenue in areas ranging from transportation to philately and is examining other initiatives to improve its management of costs. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said the April rate increase, combined with reduced <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> window hours because of budget cuts enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, plays into the hands of those who want to turn mail delivery over to private business. Federal budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has called for ending the government monopoly on mail service, and a presidential commission in March advocated allowing private companies to go into the mail business. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who is a critic of such proposals, said efforts to privatize the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` can find fertile ground for growth only in shortcomings and failures of the postal system itself.'' He pledged to restore full window service as soon as finances allow, and voiced support for legislation to separate <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> finances from the rest of the federal budget. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said it was `` absurd for the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to be regulated by budgetary ` scorekeeping' rules'' designed to bring about deficit reductions.

<HEAD>Opinionated Actor Says Speaking His Mind Cost Him Stardom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>'s first film, `` Lifeguard,'' did n't catapult him to stardom as predicted a dozen years ago, due mainly, he says, to a penchant for speaking his mind. When `` Lifeguard'' was released in 1976, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> publicly attacked the studio that made the film for advertisements emphasizing an unsavory element that did n't exist in the film. `` It was about a guy coming of age and making important decisions in his life, and they were talking ... beach blanket bingo,'' he said. `` I know it had an effect on my career. Some people just do n't want to hear the truth.'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> with his actress-wife <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, is starring in `` Shakedown,'' being released Friday. And he's still speaking his mind `` I'm probably more outspoken now than I was before,'' the 43-year-old actor said recently. `` But I do n't think I put off people as much now because of my sense of humor. `` A lot of what I've said over the years was just kidding anyway, but people did n't realize it. Being opinionated was all it was.'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> confesses his undercover cop role in `` Shakedown'' is a conscious effort `` to elevate myself in this business.'' `` I'm trying to ally myself with commercially oriented movies so that I can become bankable and therefore get better roles,'' he said. `` I've turned stuff down because I did n't believe in it, and I do n't want to do anything I ca n't believe in. `` If it is n't real for me, it wo n't be real up on the screen.''

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge Cites Lack of Progress in Declassifying
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge in the Iran-Contra trial Wednesday ordered governent security officials to explain at a closed hearing the `` apparent lack of progress'' in declassifying key documents for the trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> scheduled the hearing for Friday morning and ordered the attendance of representatives of national intelligence agencies who are reviewing some 300,000 pages of classified documents collected by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The hearing will be closed to reporters and the public. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued the order a day after <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> reported that 82,820 pages of classified documents plus another 22,965 pages of classified or sensitive non-government papers had been placed in a security facility for examination by defense lawyers for Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said it apeared `` from this report and other information available to the court that the interdepartmental review committee charged with examining classified documents is apparently failing to meet the requirements of this criminal action.'' The judge, who last week accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of `` intentional withholding of documents necessary for the defense,'' said the closed hearing would be convened to consider `` the apparent lack of progress being made in declassifying essential papers.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order indicated impatience with the progress that had been made in a week. On April 28, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> reported that 35,254 classified government documents were ready for defense review. At the hearing on Friday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would set deadlines for `` reporting the final results of the declassification process.'' North and his co-defendants, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also were directed to appear along with their lawyers and prosecutors. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, secret documents can not be introduced into evidence unless they are declassified by the agency that generated them. The interdepartmental task force that is reviewing the material consists of representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as well as the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, State and Justice. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has warned repeatedly that unless the defendants are able to introduce relevant portions of the secret documents as evidence he would be forced to dismiss charges they conspired to divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. During one hearing last week, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` a stone wall is being built up between this court and the trial.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has described the documents as containing some of the government's most closely guarded secrets, the disclosure of which could jeopardize the lives of hostages being held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence and military planning. Some of this secret material, if disclosed, could `` expose people in very difficult situations to torture and death'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> testified last week there were some documents found in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s office that were so secret even `` he should n't have had.'' Meawhile, the defense has argued that the unprecedented volume of classified documents will make it impossible for the four defendants to get a fair trial under procedures imposed by the law for disclosing government secrets in court. The classified procedures statute requires the defense to notify the prosecution in advance of trial of any secrets it wants to disclose in court. This requirement, among other things, would force the defense to tip its hand before trial, the defense lawyers contended in a motion filed last week to declare the law's provisions unconstitutional as applied to this case

<HEAD>Interior Minister Says Nicaragua Talked to Rebels Because of War's
Cost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the government agreed to negotiate with Contra rebels because of the high cost of the war in lives and resources and as a way of holding indirect talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he cautioned that if the cease-fire talks failed, the entire nation would be called to battle the U.S.-supported rebels. The leftist leader, in an interview Tuesday night, described the almost 9-year-old Sandinista government as `` the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> we dreamed of,'' despite opposition from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` administration that is particularly aggressive, visceral, expansionist and reactionary.'' The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed the pro-American dictatorship of the late <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The Contras began their fight 1 -LCB- years later. `` We've paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty and dignity,'' said <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, one of nine commanders in the directorate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. More than 26,000 people have been killed in the war, and the government claims the economy has suffered losses of more than $ 3 billion. Recent talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> with the Contras to work out a lasting armistice have faltered as the two sides attempt to define a vaguely worded cease-fire pact signed March 23. A fragile 60-day truce remains in effect until the end of this month. The rebels have refused a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> offer to extend it an additional 30 days. Should the truce end without an agreement to either prolong the cease-fire or a lasting peace plan, `` we'll mobilize the entire nation,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> agreed to negotiations with the rebels because it `` has paid a high cost in blood'' in the war. `` But if the Contras were not badly beaten militarily, or held land, they would never negotiate with us,'' he said. The Sandinistas initially refused to hold direct talks with the Contras or allow them to come to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for discussions. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> acknowledged the back-pedaling but said, `` We will never discuss political power'' with the Contras. `` We understand the negotiations with the Contras are indirect -LRB- talks -RRB- with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had long said that any discussions to end the fighting should be with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration because of its aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> dismissed rumors that the directorate was split between his hard-line followers and those of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` The worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries ... who fight among themselves,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said. `` We all discuss and discuss until we're in agreement. There are certain contradictions. That's natural and helps contribute and move things forward.'' He said the Sandinistas would give up power if they lost in elections, but said that would be the end of the Nicaraguan revolution. `` And this is impossible, nothing can kill the revolution,'' he added. Asked if the government was Marxist-Leninist, <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the teachings of those two thinkers was `` a universal science and anyone who does n't study it is either mentally retarded or ignorant.'' He said Marxist-Leninist theory `` was an important guide in our decisions.'' He praised the government's ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which provides most of the country's aid. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said, `` helps us and respects us and we appreciate it.''

 The play was praised but the critics were not as kind to <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, making her Broadway debut in `` Speed-The-Plow,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s scathing comedy about two <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers and a temporary secretary. `` No, She Ca n't Act'' headlined the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Its drama critic, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON>, called `` Speed-The-Plow'' `` <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s clearest, wittest play,'' but added `` I bet it would be even funnier with an actress. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> agreed. He said the rock star `` sounds more as if she were auditioning than acting, and the audition is scarcely for the big time. There is a genuine, reticent charm here, but it not yet ready to light the lamps on Broadway.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> was more positive. He said <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> `` serves Mr. <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s play much as she did the <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidelman </PERSON> film ` Desperately Seeking <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>,' with intelligent, scrupulously disciplined comic acting.'' `` She delivers the shocking transitions essential to the action and needs only more confidence to relax a bit and fully command her speaking voice,'' the Times said. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s role is the smallest in the three-character play, and she is on stage less than half the time. The play also stars <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>. But it has been <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> who sold tickets. `` Speed-The-Plow'' orginally was scheduled to open at the 299-seat <ORGANIZATION> Mitzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> in Lincoln Center but ticket demand was so great than it was moved to the 1,058-seat Royale Theater. Even so, the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, which produced the play on Broadway, deliberately downplayed <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s role in the production. It declined all interviews for the star and kept publicity to a minimum. By the time the show opened Tuesday night, it had a good but not overwhelming advance sale of $ 500,000. With the favorable reviews, the box office expected to take in more than $ 100,000 the day after the opening, said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Debuskey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the show. <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, who play the sleazy <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers, were universally lauded. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON>, writing in Newsday, called <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> `` irresistible,'' and she said <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> delivered `` a riveting breakthrough performance.'' Said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, `` The men could not be better. Mr. <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> gives the performance of his career.'' `` Speed-The-Plow'' is <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s third play to be done on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` American Buffalo,'' starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, has a financially unsuccessful run in 1977, but later was revived successfully off-Broadway with <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s `` Glengarry <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>,'' which opened on Broadway in 1984, won a Pulitzer Prize for drama. <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> won a Tony Award in that play. All three stars are committed to appear in the play for six months.

<HEAD>$6.5 Billion A Year Needed To Upgrade Nation's Housing, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government will have to spend $ 6.5 billion more a year on housing over the next 15 years if every American is to have a decent, affordable place to live, an industry-backed study said Wednesday. The study, financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the nation will need to spend $ 41 billion to help build or renovate 36 million housing units over the period because many Americans now live without adequate plumbing, sewage disposal or electricity or in overcrowded conditions. In addition, $ 56 billion over current levels will be needed to subsidize families that would otherwise have to pay more than the recommended 30 percent of their income for housing, according to the study performed by the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a research organization. `` We are reminded daily of the homeless on our streets and shelters. Less visible, but no better off, are those who live in inadequate housing or who pay the majority of their incomes just to stay off these streets,'' said <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON>, president of the Realtors association, who presented the study at a news conference. `` If we do n't take some affirmative action,'' the `` primary <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of home ownership'' will not be realized for growing percentages of people, the real estate executive said. With the widening gap between income and housing costs, home ownership for people between the ages of 25 and 34 has dropped 20 percent so far in the 1980s, he said. In addition to government help to build and upgrade housing, <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON> recommended restoring tax incentives for investment in low-and moderate-income housing, more local government action to encourage building and a law to allow younger people to use tax-free retirement funds for down payment on a home. The study, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Housing Needs to the 21st Century,'' said 7.7 million households are living in substandard units and 3.2 million others are in overcrowded conditions. It said more than 6 percent of housing units in urban areas and 17 percent of units in rural areas do n't meet minimum standards set by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> classifies a dwelling as substandard if it does not have electricity, lacks adequate plumbing or lacks sewage disposal. The study did not address the likelihood of getting additional funds through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at a time of budget constraints imposed by the high federal deficits. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, Realtors association chief economist, said the group is working with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on comprehensive housing legislation that he expects to pass next year. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has generally opposed any new housing initiatives and scaled back many of the programs in existence when it came into office in 1981. The <ORGANIZATION> Realtors-Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> study is the latest of several recent reports looking into the country's housing needs. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issued a report recommending a 12-year program with a goal of providing livable housing for all Americans. The private task force recommended the program begin with a $ 3 billion appropriation to be used as seed money to stimulate state and local efforts to develop and renovate low-income housing. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said all the recent studies point to the same need. He said the Realtors study is the first to evaluate what it would take to wipe out the housing problem over a set period of time.

<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> is mailing every American household a historic pamphlet with explicit advice on how to avoid the deadly AIDS virus, including the use of condoms. In unveiling the booklet at a news conference Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said the $ 17 million AIDS project represented `` the first time the federal government has attempted to contact virtually every resident, directly by mail, regarding a public health crisis.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> to play the leading role in the project because `` Americans know and have faith in the health advisories of the surgeon general, and that trust will help ensure the success of this effort.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s photo appears on the cover, along with a brief message over his signature. `` Some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things you are used to discussing openly,'' he wrote. `` I can easily understand that. But now you must discuss them. We all must know about AIDS. Read this brochure and talk about it with those you love.'' Although fine print at the bottom identifies it as an official government document _ `` HHS Publication No. -LRB- CDC -RRB- HHS-88-8404'' _ the slick layout produced by a private public relations company does not smack of officialese. And despite the explicit language contained in the eight pages, the booklet will not be in a plain brown envelope when it starts appearing in the nation's mailboxes May 26. Before that time, television networks have been asked to broadcast a series of promotional spots alerting their viewers to be looking for the mailer. Posters also are going up in 7,000 post offices and other locations advertising: `` You Asked For Answers About AIDS. They're In The Mail.'' The AIDS virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. The second page of the brochure bears the blue heading `` How Do You Get AIDS From Sex?'' and goes on to state that the deadly AIDS virus `` can enter the body through the vagina, penis, rectum or mouth.'' `` Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky,'' it continues. `` The rectum is easily injured during anal intercourse.'' The fourth page is half filled by a section boldly headlined: `` What Is All The Talk About Condoms?'' `` Not so very long ago, condoms -LRB- rubbers or prophylactics -RRB- were things we did n't talk about very much,'' it says. `` Now, they're discussed on the evening news and on the front page of your newspaper, and displayed out in the open in your local drugstore, grocery and convenience store `` For those who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual activity to one partner, condoms have been shown to help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That is why the use of condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of AIDS.'' Federal health officials have projected there will be 270,000 cases of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 1991 and that as many as 1.5 million Americans are infected with the virus now. The content of the pamphlet was a closely held secret in an obvious _ although not officially acknowledged effort _ to keep the message from being diluted by political pressure from outside the health department. In his remarks at the news conference, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, `` A careful reading of this brochure should enable the reader to separate true health information from various political agendas promoted at the expense of the public's health.'' He said mailing the brochure `` is the closest we can come to making something required reading in every American home. I hope that parents, grandparents, children and teen-agers will set a time when they can sit down together and review the information in these eight pages. `` I would hope that schools could do the same thing in classrooms where the age is appropriate,'' added <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who came under stern criticism from conservatives in 1986 when his initial 36-page, more technical report on AIDS called for sex education in schools to help combat the epidemic. Asked if he expects a new wave of criticism in response to the latest report, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, `` I expect everything all the time.'' The surgeon general noted that legislation ordering a national mailer by June 30 spelled out that its content was not to be subject to clearance outside the health department. `` We took them at their word,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` This was not cleared in the sense that some documents are.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> did say it was `` discussed with key people'' at the White House. Asked later to elaborate, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said staff members of the White House Domestic Policy Council asked to see a copy after `` camera-ready'' pages of the brochure were ready to send to the printers. `` No changes were made,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. Plans for a national mailer last year were dropped, largely because the <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> suggested that such a project should be reviwed by the then newly appointed White House AIDS commission.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, taking a conciliatory tone toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said today he believes that `` there is hope for further change'' in Soviet human rights policies. At the same time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an `` agonizing'' problem in dealing with its homeless and needs to do more to curb unemployment and combat bigotry. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the remarks in a speech that was markedly less confrontational than his foreign policy address in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, April 21, which Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rebuked as confrontational. Both speeches were billed as scene-setters for the May 29-June 2 summit meeting between the two leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In his address here to the National Strategy Forum, a non-partisan organization that sponsors educational programs on national security and foreign policy issues, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that over the last three years some 300 political and religious prisoners have been released from Soviet labor camps. He said the changes were `` limited'' and added, `` We encourage the Soviets to go further.'' `` But we applaud the changes that have taken place,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also `` heartened'' by the increased rate of people being permitted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a brief question-and-answer session with the audience, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was willing to give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` the benefit of the doubt, up to a point,'' that he sincerely wants to achieve the program of economic and social reforms known as glasnost. He also expressed a dream `` to rid the world'' of nuclear weapons. He compared the danger of nuclear weapons to a hypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a power from outer space. `` Would n't we all of a sudden find that we did n't have any differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens of the world, and would n't we come together to fight that particular threat?,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, said that applications for Jewish emigration are now being handled `` reasonably fast.'' But he told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry that Jews wishing to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should apply now, lest the approval process slow down. For his part, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` In recent months, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has shown a willingness to respect at least some human rights. It is my belief that there is hope for further change, hope that in the days ahead the Soviets will grant further recognition to the fundamental civil and political rights of all.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also noted that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has initiated some reforms _ allowing over the last three years the release of 300 political and religious prisoners from prison camps, slowing the incarcerations of dissidents in mental hospital and prisons, and allowing some broadenings of freedom of the press. He then noted that the Soviets often reply to criticism of their human rights record by noting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has problems of homelessness, unemployment and discrimination within its own borders. `` Yes, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has social and economic shortcomings,'' he said. `` Unemployment, for one. As a free people we have created an economic expansion that over the past five years has created nearly 16 million jobs, but we need to do more.'' `` Homelessness is indeed a problem, and an agonizing one,'' he added. `` As a free people, our churches, synagogues, and a host of volunteer organizations do much to provide the homeless with food, clothing and medicines. And yet, there is no denying that a problem remains.'' `` Racial discrimination -- our strides as a free people during just the past three decades have been dramatic,'' the president said. `` Yet the problem lingers, and we continue to battle bigotry and prejudie.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while `` so-called economic and social rights belong to an essentially different category from civil and political rights,'' it is also true that `` the Soviets may be coming to understand something of the connection ... between human rights and economic growth.'' `` The Soviets should recognize basic human rights because it is the right thing to do,'' he said. `` But, if they recognize human rights for reasons of their own _ because they seek economic growth, or because they want to enter into a more normal relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations _ well, I want to say here and now, that's fine by me.'' In his <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said that if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was changing it was `` because the costs of aggression and the real moral difference between our systems were brought home to it.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also spoke sharply of the Soviets in that speech and suggested they might not be sincere about their stated intention to end their military occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech, giving way to a round of harsh tit-for-tat rejoinders that have marked U.S.-Soviet comments in recent weeks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> decried the `` confrontational'' tone of the speech and said that if the Soviets responded in kind, it could become `` no longer possible to solve any further issues'' between the two superpowers. In a speech Tuesday, the president said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has admitted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> made mistakes dealing with religious believers in decades past and they would be `` rectified.'' `` What we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continued change, in the spirit of glasnost, when it comes to matters of religion,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a meeting on religious rights at the White House. Glasnost is the Russian term for the Soviet leader's policy of bringing openness to Soviet society.

<HEAD>Robbery Victim Charged With Assaulting Alleged Assailant</HEAD>

 A teen-ager was charged with assault Wednesday after he shot one of six youths who robbed him aboard a subway train, police said. The bullet glanced off the young man's chest and he was not seriously injured, said <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>. Officials denied any similarity between the incident and the highly publicized <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> shooting. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who is white, shot four black young men who surrounded him and demanded money aboard a subway. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said <PERSON> Decosta </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 17, shot <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, after <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and five others accosted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as a train pulled into a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> subway station around 12:40 a.m. Wednesday. The gang put <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in a headlock, threw him to the floor of the subway car and took a gold ring and his wallet, containing $ 20, <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. `` At some point, Mr. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> decided he had enough and he pulls out a .25 - caliber silver Raven automatic pistol and fires one shot,'' striking <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> The TA spokesman denied any similarity to the <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> case, saying: `` Here a violent felony was committed against the victim before he fired any shots. In the <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> case there was a threat or perception of a crime about to be committed.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who was acquitted of attempted murder and assault charges but convicted of weapons possession, said he thought the young men were trying to rob him. His victims said they were only panhandling. In the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shooting, the victim and his attackers were all black. The wounded youth stumbled off the train and told a transit officer he had been shot. After transit police found <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and heard his story, they arrested both <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Police also eventually arrested four other teen-agers, including a 14-year-old boy who had <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s gold ring and a high school pass in his pockets. Transit police were still looking for the other youth. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was charged with second-degree assault, illegal weapons possession and reckless endangerment, according to <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>. In addition to the attackers, there were several other passengers aboard the train. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and the other four were charged with first-degree robbery.

 <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Accuses Japanese of Protectionism, But Opens Door to Resuming Talks

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> on Wednesday sharply accused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of protectionism in its dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over beef and orange import quotas. But he left open the door to restarting negotiations that collapsed here Tuesday night. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the Japanese restrictions `` presumably'' will be be declared illegal by <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under a complaint process accepted by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> hours after breakdown of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> talks. Such a finding would open the way to compensation or possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade reprisals or a combination of both, he said. `` My patience as a negotiator has come to an end,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told a news conference, but he still talked of a possible resumption of talks. He accused the Japanese of failing to match <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concessions in the prolonged dispute and of making a beef price-fixing proposal amounting to `` clearly the antithesis of free and open trade.'' However, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said overall trade relations between the two countries are `` still very good'' and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would be happy at any time'' to listen to new Japanese proposals provided they `` reflect a whole lot more market liberalization than surfaced in the last few days ... `` Hopefully they will reappraise their position and come forth with much more accommodating proposals sometime in the future ...'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` If an opportunity arises to resolve the issue through negotiations in the next two to three months while the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel is organizing itself, we would be very pleased.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said during the talks he had offered to waive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims for potential compensation for damages to its export trade if the Japanese would agree to a two-year phaseout of the quotas `` but even that was unacceptable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of about $ 550 million could grow to about $ 1 billion under free trade and exports of oranges and orange juice, now less than $ 100 million a year, could top $ 150 million. Warning that `` we will not tolerate stalling of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> process by the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, `` we will be a lot harder to deal with once we have a decision'' from <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will not permit this case to spill into the next administration. We're going to resolve this dispute one way or another during this -LRB- President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s -RRB- administration,'' he said. He also accused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of delaying action on opening markets to 12 varieties of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> processed foods in a case settled by <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will pursue this with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> in June, he said. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said in a statement issued by his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has insisted throughout on complete removal of the beef and orange quotas. Disclosing new details of his negotiations with Japanese Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, however, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have accepted a proposal for a three-year phaseout of the beef quota if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had not sought to raise new barriers. He also said a two-year phaseout of orange and orange juice import quotas could have been accepted, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> insisted on five years and offered only a 10 percent annual tonnage increase.

 Israeli forces shelled a Syrian-held town and battled pro-Iranian guerrillas today and then announced that the Israeli drive into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had ended. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reported that three Israelis and more than 40 Arab guerrillas were killed. The Israeli military said in a statement issued late today in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that the two-day operation had ended and all participating Israeli forces had returned to their bases. The Israeli military statement said 17 Israelis were wounded. It said most of the Arab guerrillas killed were members of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most radical Shiite Moslem faction. The army statement said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas had expelled all the residents from the village of <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION>, some 12 miles north of the Israeli border, and were using the village as a launching point for attacks on Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia allies. Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were in <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> when the fighting started today, the Israeli army command said. It said helicopter gunships and Israeli artillery destroyed the guerrillas' artillery and vehicles with mounted anti-aircraft guns. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> identified two of the dead troopers as Capt. <PERSON> Boaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ovad </LOCATION> and Sgt. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nahariya </LOCATION>. The name of third dead Israeli was not immediately made public. Security sources in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said earlier today that the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers died when the army stormed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla bases. A police spokesman, who like the security sources spoke on condition of anonymity, said seven guerrillas were killed in the shootout around the villages of <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Tineh </PERSON> in the southwestern sector of the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The villages are five miles south of the town of <LOCATION> Mashghara </LOCATION>, where police said a 50-man Syrian garrison came under Israeli howitzer fire. There was no immediate word on any Syrian casualties, and it was not known if the Syrians responded to the Israeli shellfire. <LOCATION> Mashghara </LOCATION> is four miles west of the Israelis' forward positions and is the Syrians' southern outpost in the western <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>. The action was the first contact between the Syrians, who have 16,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>, and the Israelis since they pushed out of their self-designated border `` security zone'' Monday night to knock out guerrilla bases. It was also the first time the Syrians have come under Israeli fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since they were forced from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in heavy fighting when the Israelis invaded in June 1982. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> armored column stormed bases manned by guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in hills overlooking <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Tineh </PERSON>. The villages are nine miles west of five villages the Israelis sealed off Tuesday and searched for Palestinian guerrillas and allied Lebanese militiamen. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spotters saw an Israeli helicopter exchange fire with guerrillas in a dry riverbed southeast of Maydoun about 4:30 a.m. He said he could not confirm Lebanese reports a helicopter was shot down. The police spokesman said gunners of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army later opened up on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> tanks with Soviet-made 130mm howitzers deployed near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Qaroun </LOCATION>, about six miles east of <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION>. Security sources in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> reported that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sent two more mechanized battalions into the area during the night, doubling the size of their force to about 2,500 troops. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Tuesday he did not expect the operation to provoke a confrontation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s staunchest enemy. The Israeli operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is its largest in two years. The clashes in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> occurred as <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters virtually shut down the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with a general strike. At least 180 Arabs have been killed since the unrest began in the occupied territories Dec. 8. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish teen-age settler also have been slain. Police said hundreds of civilians fled villages near the security zone during today's fighting. Reporters in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> saw dozens of villagers carrying belongings, blankets and mattresses heading for safer areas behind the Syrian lines. Shortly after today's advance, 500 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers began withdrawing from five <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> villages. A police spokesman said the Israelis began pulling out of <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Memis </PERSON>, Kfeer, <PERSON> Khalwat </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> after `` completing the search.'' The spokesman said the Israelis rounded up several Lebanese militiamen allied with the Palestinians in the five villages and seized `` large quantities of weapons and ammunition.'' A resident of <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> told reporters <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers detained 30 men in the village Tuesday. The Israeli army declined comment. The Lebanese spokesman said the Israelis used police dogs in house-to-house searches in <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> and nearby villages and called on the population `` not to cooperate with saboteurs and accomplices.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up the security zone after it withdrew the bulk of its army from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985, three years after invading its northern neighbor.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Beach Segregation In Port Elizabeth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A court ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> must let all races onto its beaches. Groups of blacks rushed to the shore, running triumphantly on the previously `` whites only'' sand. The regional <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the southeastern port supported a city councilor and a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who claimed the city council acted without proper authority when it passed a resolution in 1966 segregating the beaches of the nation's fifth-largest city. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, the constitutional development minister, and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> administrator <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> opposed the suit. Their lawyers said they may appeal. Heunis and President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> have taken a middle ground recently on the volatile issue of `` beach apartheid,'' saying some beaches should be integrated but others reserved for whites. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose power is growing, opposes any integration of beaches. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the white city councilor who filed the challenge, called the court decision `` a small victory for those of us fighting what sometimes seems to be a losing battle against the continuous inroads made by the government against basic human rights.'' Most beaches are open to all races in the two largest coastal cities, <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. One section of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>'s beachfront remains segregated. blacks are barred from many beaches in smaller communities. In January 1987, <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s beaches were the scene of a political confrontation between <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the mixed-race chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> waded into the surf in well-publicized defiance of apartheid segregation laws. He later apologized to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, which hurt his credibility with anti-apartheid groups. After learning of Wednesday's ruling, <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> said in Parliament: `` Somebody owes me an apology.'' Also Wednesday, two African National <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were sentenced to be hanged for land mine explosions that jolted northern farming communities in 1985-86. They were convicted of murder last week in <LOCATION> Messina </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Mzondileli </PERSON> <PERSON> Nondula </PERSON>, 25, was convicted of planting a mine that killed two white women and four white children in December 1985. <PERSON> Mthetheleli </PERSON> <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON>, 28, was convicted of setting a mine that killed a black man in November 1985 and of killing two white policemen in a subsequent escape attempt. `` We have lost the battle but not the war,'' <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON> said after the sentence. `` We shall win.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main guerrilla movement fighting white domination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> offered to compensate relatives for the funeral expenses of two boys shot to death in 1985 by policemen who were hiding in crates on a truck to entrap stone-throwing youngsters in a mixed-race township. A judge ruled at an inquest March 3 into what is called the `` Trojan horse'' incident that police acted unreasonably, but on Tuesday a prosecutor declined to press charges against the officers. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said his department would pay the funeral expenses and legal costs borne by the families of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Magmoed </PERSON>, 16. The families are expected to get about 900 rand -LRB- $ 425 -RRB- each.

 Slain Lumbee Indian candidate <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> outpolled <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> in the race for a superior court judge's seat in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> will become judge in December. Even though the vote Tuesday carries no legal power, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> supporters said it has symbolic meaning for minority residents' struggle to rid their county of discrimination and corruption `` The turnout in the minority precincts was even higher than for school merger -LRB- which was passed by county voters March 8 -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s campaign manager. `` That is people making a strong statement. The voters believed in what he stood for.'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, the county's district attorney, was automatically declared the winner of the Democratic nomination for a new state superior court judgeship after <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was killed in his home March 26 by three shotgun blasts in what authorities say was a domestic dispute. One man was charged with murder in his death, while another committed suicide before he could be arrested, authorities said. In unofficial vote totals from 28 of the county's 40 precincts, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> got 7,652 votes to <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s 5,238 in the judgeship race. <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Murchison </PERSON> `` Bo'' <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said state law prevents election officials from counting or publicizing the results of the Britt-Pierce race because there was no contest.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Wednesday its security men arrested a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> spy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. It also claimed the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> beat up Iranian diplomats and seized documents after the rupture in relations between the two countries. The Iranian allegations underscored the growing tension between the two <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on April 26. In a brief statement, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said security authorities `` arrested an agent of the <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> regime who had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials -LRB- 4.5 million dollars -RRB-.'' `` He will be dealt with as a spy,'' the statement said. Convicted spies may be sentenced to death under <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic law. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also quoted an unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the man was planning to `` spread Wahhabi faith and the American brand of Islam.'' The Wahhabis are an ultra-conservative Sunni Moslem sect. Most Saudis, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s ruling family, are Wahhabis. The majority of Iranians are Shiite Moslems. `` The measures that were taken were no more than the normal procedure in line with diplomatic norms under such circumstances,'' the official was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> made no immediate comment on the arrest of the alleged spy. Diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s embassy in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> and a consulate in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, who were given one week to leave the country, returned home Wednesday. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> called `` totally baselesss'' Iranian claims that the diplomats were beaten up and that documents were confiscated from the two missions. Saudi-Iranian ties have deteriorated rapidly in recent months after repeated Iranian charges that the Saudis are helping <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in its war against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Last year, Iranians ransacked the Saudi Arabian embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and killed a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> diplomat, saying the action was in retaliation for the killings of 275 Iranian pilgrims in clashes last July with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> security police in Islam's holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has called for the overthrow of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> regime and said it must be stripped of control of Islam's holy shrines in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. The Saudis said they will allow only 45,000 Iranian pilgrims to enter <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> during this year's pilgrimage. The Iranians have insisted they will send the same number of pilgrims as last year _ 150,000.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> has asked a judge to skip a trial and immediately decide whether she or <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> own papers of her slain husband, civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. At issue are 83,000 documents now at King's alma mater that range from letters to <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to the outline of his `` I Have a Dream'' speech A sworn statement and documents turned over by the university support allegations that King never donated his papers to <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> claimed in a request for a summary judgment filed last week in <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's kind of a shortcut in the case,'' said <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney, in a telephone interview Wednesday. `` The letter is so clear. We're asking the judge to cut through the jargon and everything else.'' No hearing on the request for summary judgment was immediately set. The case has not yet been assigned to a judge. Last December, Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to recover the papers her husband gave to the school where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1955. The suit claims the university has not properly maintained the papers and is illegally keeping them. King sent the papers to the school in 1964, four years before his assassination. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> wants the papers kept with 100,000 more in his archives at the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> In the request for a summary judgment, Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s lawyers said that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotlieb </PERSON>, chief of reference and special collections for <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> libraries, had indicated in a deposition that as far as he knew, King never designated any of the papers at the university as an outright gift. The university also gave Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s lawyers a 1964 letter by G.A. <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON>, then director of libraries for the university, saying the university was interested in becoming the repository for King's papers <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> trustee whose law firm is representing the university in its countersuit against Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, scoffed at the latest volley from the other side. `` It's strange that they think there are no questions of fact in this case,'' he said. `` Everything is to be settled. Nothing is settled.'' Key to the entire battle is a July 16, 1964, letter by King naming <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> repository of his papers. King was killed in 1968 and did not leave a will. In the letter, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the papers would remain his legal property but that every year he would donate part of the collection to the university. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s lawyers maintain that while King sent papers to <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he did not take the step of making them a gift. The university in its countersuit claims it owns the King papers in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as well as those it has because the 1964 letter made <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> the depository for all King's papers. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s lawyers insist the letter did not constitute a contract or charitable pledge and violates laws governing wills. They have asked that the countersuit be dismissed.

<HEAD>`Granny Kids' Forsake Big-City Schools for Quiet Southern Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNDS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To local folks they're known as `` granny kids,'' children who leave their homes and big-city schools in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area for quiet Southern Illinois towns and their smaller, friendlier schools. They're scattered throughout the area, living with their `` grannies'' and other relatives during the school year and heading for the urban north in the summer. It's hard to determine exactly how many there are because they list home addresses in the area when they enroll, school officials say. But they're there, and have been for years. `` We just have to check to make sure their guardianship is in the hands of someone in our district,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Corzine </PERSON>, assistant superintendent in the Egyptian School District near <LOCATION> Tamms </LOCATION>. `` There's not a major number of them, though,'' <PERSON> Corzine </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Gang violence, drugs and overcrowding are among the reasons given for leaving city schools, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaner </PERSON>, guidance counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mounds </LOCATION>. But such problems are `` societal,'' not school-bred, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, like any other big city, it's got its share of problems,'' he said. But he added that the city's schools are `` 100 percent safe. I defy anybody to say they're unsafe.'' Many of the imported students at local schools are carrying on a family tradition. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, 15, is attending Meridian like his older sister, who graduated from there before going on to <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. `` It's a lot friendlier here,'' <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> said. `` Up there, the teachers do n't even know your name.'' <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> began his freshman year last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Evanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which has 4,000 students, some gang problems and `` a lot of drug traffic,'' he said. At midterm, he transferred to the 320-student Meridian. His parents sent him south _ more than 350 miles south _ to live with his grandparents so that he could attend a smaller, quieter high school. `` We do have gangs in the city of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. There is no visible of gang problems at the school,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, director of the safety department at <ORGANIZATION> Evanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no doubt some kids are using drugs and selling them, but it's not rampant.'' `` I think it's a safe school for studets to come here and study, if that's what they want to do,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s story was not new to school administrators in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. There has been a Chicago-to-Southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> school connection for at least 20 years, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rueffer </PERSON>, director of special programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ullin </LOCATION>. `` A lot of them even start when they are little,'' <PERSON> Shaner </PERSON> said. Most granny kids adapt readily to the new environment _ but it does take some adjustment. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s school-year home of <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> has a population of 500 _ about one-eighth the student body at his hometown school. `` There's not much to do,'' he said of the village just north of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> at the southern tip of the state. `` My mom thought this would be a better place for me,'' <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> said. And with fewer distractions, he said he can concentrate on another goal. `` I just want to get into a good college.''

 Leftist guerrillas who kidnapped 14 Colombian, West German, French and <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> officials and journalists said they will release the hostages soon with a message, the sister of one captive reported Wednesday. Attorney General <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> called the abductions `` a propaganda operation'' by two guerrilla organizations: the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Castro group; and the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Tuesday night phoned the sister of kidnap victim <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON>, president of the legislature of the department of <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON> said the spokesman told her that her brother and the others were being held at a camp in the country's northeastern mountains, where the guerrillas are active. The guerrillas will release their hostages in the next few days with a `` document of an international importance,'' she quoted the spokesman as saying. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Wednesday that honorary consuls <PERSON> Sigfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Markert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Luecker </PERSON> were kidnapped Tuesday. Local police said four armed guerrillas kidnapped <PERSON> Markert </PERSON>, 59, from his metals company in <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>, 200 miles from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, as employees watched. <PERSON> Luecker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s honorary consul in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, also disappeared Tuesday. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second largest city, is 250 miles from the capital. Callers identifying themselves as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members told <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio stations they had seized <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Christophe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rampal </PERSON>, a public information officer at the French Embassy. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the French <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials had not heard from <PERSON> Rampal </PERSON> since Friday but could not confirm he had been kidnapped.

The others are two regional politicians, <PERSON> Otoniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>.

 `` Injured'' astronauts and launch pad workers scrambled into escape baskets Wednesday as they fled a mock fire and explosion during a space shuttle disaster drill. For safety reasons, they did not ride the baskets down long cables, traveling instead by elevator to the ground, then re-entering the baskets to continue the exercise. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it will `` man-rate'' the baskets before the next shuttle flight. All seven participating astronauts and several other personnel received make-believe injuries in the four-hour pad test. Two of the astronauts were among nine `` seriously injured'' people transported by helicopter to two hospitals that conducted their own emergency rehearsals. The drill tested new safety procedures initiated since the in-flight explosion of Challenger and the loss of its seven crew members Jan. 28, 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since then, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s top official, administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, said Tuesday that flights are not expected to resume before late August or September. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, one of the astronauts taking part, told a news conference later: `` We felt it was really a good test. We have to be prepared for a launch pad emergency, and we very happy with the way the system worked today.'' Among new launch pad features tested Wednesday were improved fire detection equipment, more fire-resistant material, a new steel-reinforced concrete underground bunker and a backup electrical relay line that flashes a warning to launch directors if a pad emergency occurs. Such an `` emergency'' took place shortly after the seven astronauts, all trainees, rode elevators to the 195-foot level of launch pad 39B as if they were to board a shuttle on launch day. Although there was no shuttle on the pad, they simulated entry into a spacecraft cabin. About that time, a smoke bomb was detonated on the pad, and test director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON> ordered an evacuation. With water spraying the area as it would in a real emergency, the astronauts and the seven members of the spacecraft closeout crew donned oxygen masks and made their way to seven slidewire baskets at the cabin level of the pad. Fire-rescue workers rushed to the pad from a station a mile away. As they fought a mock fire at the 175-foot level, a `` hydraulic explosion'' occurred and test observers declared five firefighters `` injured.'' No one rode the escape baskets down 1,200-foot cables to the ground. Some officials believe the swift 50 mph trip and abrupt halt in netting at the bottom would be risky and should be attempted only in an actual emergency. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans soon to test the baskets with human passengers. They most seriously `` injured'' were transported in fireproof tank-like vehicles to a heliport for air delivery to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> or to <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>. Astronauts participating Wednesday were <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuot </PERSON> and Jerome Apt. Another emergency drill is scheduled Friday to simulate a rescue of crew members from a shuttle that has `` crash-landed'' in a swamp near the shuttle landing runway.

 A new poll indicates two-thirds of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> support making the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> the nation's 51st state, leaders of the statehood movement said Wednesday. A telephone survey of 1,011 households nationwide conducted in March by the <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, indicates that 66 percent of those contacted support making the nation's capital a state, an increase of 14 percentage points increase over a similar poll conducted a year ago. `` We can proclaim today that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people overwhelmingly support statehood for the nation's capital,'' said Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, who has introduced in the House of Representatives a bill to establish the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` America now knows, and cares, that we achieve full citizenship.'' Results from the poll, which carried a margin of error of 3 percentage points, also indicate that 83 percent of those surveyed believe residents of the district `` should have the same rights as citizens of the other 50 states.'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s bill, which was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last year, would create a state out of all non-federal lands in the district, give voting rights to a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and two senators, and establish a state government. Currently, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> is the only congressional representative for the 625,000 residents of the nation's capital, and he can not vote on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The measure has 197 co-sponsors, and <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said he was confident he will secure the 218 votes needed to assure <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval. He said he hoped to bring the matter up for a vote `` before the Fourth of July.'' One former opponent, Rep. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky., said Wednesday that he has decided to support the bill after <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> agreed to study the possibility of eliminating the city's federal subsidy The district receives about $ 500 million of its $ 2.8 billion annual operating budget in direct federal subsidies, and <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> and others have opposed creating a state that would receive federal money in such a way. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, who noted that 55 percent of all land in the nation's capital is federally owned, and thus off the tax rolls, predicted that congressmen will understand the district's unique position

 <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has n't slept well since leaving <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> six years ago to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally, but she expects that to change once she receives her papers under the federal amnesty program. `` I had insomnia. I worried at night that someone could come and take me away. When my papers come, I'm going to sleep at night,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, one of thousands of illegal aliens who jammed <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> offices in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the last day to apply for residency under the law. The law permitted people who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally before Jan. 1, 1982, and lived in this country continuously to apply for temporary resident status. They later must apply for permanent status and can eventually apply for citizenship. Immigration officials expected up to 125,000 aliens to apply in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. By Wednesday morning, 112,000 had done so, and applications were pouring in as the midnight deadline neared, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, deputy director of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> INS office. Like Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, many said they waited until the last minute simply because they procrastinated. Lines were long at the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office here, but most of the waiting people were smiling. `` They say this place is bad, but it's the best there is,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who complain about their government. But as an illegal alien, `` I did n't have a life of my own, control of my destiny,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 19, who married <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native, last July 4. The newlyweds moved recently to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which reminds her of <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which she could n't risk visiting as an illegal alien for fear of not being allowed back into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A sister and two brothers in <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> `` keep writing, asking me when I'm going to visit. I wanted to go but I could n't. I'd say I was going soon as I get my papers,'' she said, beaming at the prospect of receiving a work permit next week and residency status this summer. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' mother, a nurse, moved illegally to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when her daughter was 3. Almost 10 years later, she sent for her children, and friends smuggled three of them into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` I went right through the border. They just asked if we had fruits,'' she said. She lived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with her mother, who applied for amnesty Tuesday, and attended the <ORGANIZATION> Kenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> there. Her husband, who works at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> apartment complex, said his wife's easy entry compounded her immigration woes. `` They say she could n't have gotten through the border. It'd be easier if we said she swam across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>.'' The couple said they were advised it would be faster for her to receive a work permit by seeking amnesty rather than applying as a citizen's spouse. When the papers come through, the <ORGANIZATION> Davises </ORGANIZATION> plan to save up, buy a home on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and visit <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> often.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> voters approved a tax increase to repair streets and bridges, but by such a thin margin that officials say they feel challenged to prove they will use the money effectively. `` I think people are still saying that they are skeptics, and we have to make them believe we will do the work we said we would,'' said Vice Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. The measure received 27,201 votes in favor, or 50.3 percent, to 26,920, or 49.7 percent. It will increase <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s earnings tax from 2 percent to 2.1 percent, effective July 1, the first increase in the payroll tax in 16 years. The tax is paid by everyone who works in the city, everyone who lives in the city and works elsewhere and also by businesses on their net profits. <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s business community supported the increase, while a homeowners' group led by suburbanites fought it. The increase is expected to generate $ 6.9 million in additional annual revenue to repair everything from deteriorating public buildings to potholes. `` I think it indicates that people are very reluctant to raise taxes,'' City Manager <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said of the close vote. `` I do n't think it's people saying, ` I looked up the street and I like what I see.'''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underscored his standing as Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting on Wednesday after his latest landslide primary victories, even though <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would stay in the race because `` It's not really over till it's over. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made light of astrology but noted a lot of voters believe in it. `` There are two edges to this sword,'' the vice president said as <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two carried him to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on a campaign swing. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he welcomed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s continued candidacy, so long as his rival would `` keep it positive and address issues.'' The governor's aides expressed irritation in recent days with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s barbed comments during the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> campaigns, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself replied only indirectly. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, savoring Tuesday's lopsided primary victories in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, picked up a handful of fresh Democratic National Convention delegates and arranged to receive the backing of half a dozen or more <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors later in the week _ perhaps including <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, both of whom earlier supported Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. Campaign aides said <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> was rounding up the support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Pointing his attention toward the fall campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also signed up veteran Democratic warriors <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> as advisers to his campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won support for his decision to stay in the race from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who dropped out last winter. `` I think he should because he has something to offer and I think it makes it a little more interesting,'' the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he met with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and others after winning a landslide victory in the primary election in the nation's capital. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, he said he would remain a candidate after the primary season ends on June 7, and added, `` ... I know what the boundaries are and I will respect those boundaries.'' But he also appealed to party leaders to avoid flocking to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side until after the primary season ends. `` If super delegates wait until after June 8 they are in a better position as judges to help bring balance'' rather than using party machinery to parcel out delegates before the primaries end,'' he said in a reference to 645 delegates to the Democratic National Convention who are party leaders and not elected by voters in primaries and caucuses. Campaign dropout <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he was `` 95 percent certain'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win the Democratic nomination, but he said he would hold onto his 184 delegates to wield influence `` in the unlikely event that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stubs his toe between now and the convention.'' `` I'm going to hold out until the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> primaries on June 7 and see whether I can still have an influence on the nomination,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has roughly 1,500 delegatges in The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count, out of 2,081 needed to win the nomination. He leads <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by more than 600. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> amassed the delegates needed to assure his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination a week ago in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary, but he kept up a heavy schedule of campaigning with his trip to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. He told <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> reporters he has not yet begun selecting his vice presidential running mate. He praised <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, lavishly, and said he would `` absolutely not'' rule him out for his ticket. In a conversation with reporters en route, he was asked about the reported statement in former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s soon-to-be published book that first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> consulted astrologers about the timing of presidential events. The president says he has never based any policy or decision on astrological forecasts, but does not deny consulting the writings of astrologers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred in a joking manner to the disclosure, telling reporters he had n't checked his horoscope before leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but then added that he and his wife were `` both Geminis.'' Asked about the assertion that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> relied on the position of the sun and moon and stars to make decisions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know about that. But I'll tell you one thing: there are two edges to this sword. `` There are a helluva lot of people across this country that read these columns. Otherwise they would n't be in the papers.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside a claim by astrologer <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON> that she helped <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s aides select his running mate in 1980. He said he never heard of her, but then joked: `` I'll work closely with her. She's brilliant.''

 Israeli soldiers reportedly killed two Arab protesters and wounded more than a dozen Wednesday, and strikers paralyzed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in a `` day of confrontation'' ordered by leaders of the Palestinian uprising.

Hospital officials identified the dead as <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Madhoun </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Rizik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbah </PERSON>, 17. The army confirmed the clash. A spokesman said that `` there were killed and wounded'' but did not give the exact figure. The army clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> Jabalia </LOCATION>, an Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said. He said troops also declared curfew in the Shati refugee camp and had to drive residents into their homes with tear gas and rubber bullets. Seven Arabs were wounded as army troops opened fire to disperse stone-throwing rioters at a village near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in the occcupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, hospital officials said. A 21-year-old Arab woman was hit with rubber bullets after she tried to stab an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in the marketplace in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. The soldier was not hurt. The army said troops also opened fire on stone-throwing Arab protesters in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION>. Two Palestinians were wounded in the legs, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, the fatalities brought to 182 the number of Arabs killed in the occupied territories since the start of the Arab uprising last Dec. 8. Two Israelis have been killed. Palestinians shuttered their stores and shut down public transit throughout the occupied territories in response to a leaflet signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The leaflet called for a `` day of confrontation'' and ordered Palestinians to `` cultivate the land and rebuild the houses demolished by the racist Israeli occupation.'' In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, even bakeries and street vendors that normally operate during strikes were reported closed. Wednesday's general strike was the latest of dozens of such protests called by uprising leaders, but some Arabs have started to complain about the work stoppages. `` When you ask people to do the same thing over and over, it gets to be too much. Merchants are regular people. They have to eat and feed their children too,'' businessman <PERSON> Farouak </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharekh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Zahran </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhran </PERSON>, a businessman from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said the strikes were needed to train Palestinians to keep up long-term protests. `` You have to make them ready for the civil disobedience or they will be shocked and not listen to you,'' he said in an interview. Hundreds of Palestinians chanting anti-Israeli slogans marched in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Bani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, to protest the deaths of two villagers killed Tuesday by Israeli troops. Carrying 15 outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and signs reading `` We prefer to die than to submit,'' about 2,000 villagers marched through narrow dirt streets to the village cemetery. About 30 masked men set up barricades and set tires ablaze as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers watched from rooftops. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> called for an Arab-Israeli peace settlement entailing a jointly run Jordanian-Palestinian state in 60 percent of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In an interview published in <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense Weekly, he said his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which shares power with the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, insisted that `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> must be united under <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sovereignty and remain its capital.'' Israeli residents of towns bordering the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> submitted a petition to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> expressing support for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative and urging that <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> be exchanged for peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors. The group said they were willing to remain on the border with an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, supports a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan that calls for an international conference and exchanging territory for peace. The initiative is opposed by <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' governing partner, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media said police would recommend that an Arab woman be charged in the slaying of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager shot to death by a Jewish guard in a clash between Arabs and Jewish settlers last month. The slaying in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> caused an uproar in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The woman, who was not identified, allegedly hurled a rock that hit a Jewish settler guard, <PERSON> Romam </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON>, in the head, prompting him to fire wildly and kill 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and two newspapers reported. Jewish settlers blamed Arabs for the death, but an army investigation said she was accidentally killed by <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON>.

<HEAD>TV Newsman Runs into Trouble with Story about Felons Buying Guns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal agents are investigating the actions of a television newsman who had a convicted robber buy three handguns to show how easy it is to conceal a criminal record and buy guns. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> will give results of its investigation to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which will decide whether charges should be filed, said agent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurm </PERSON>. Newsman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Martino </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> KCNC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and a cameraman accompanied a man identified as <PERSON> Ollace </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 36, to at least three gun stores as part of <PERSON> Martino </PERSON>'s report. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> filled out federal firearms purchase forms and bought three revolvers, omitting disclosure of a 1972 robbery conviction. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> bought a .357 - caliber Magnum from <ORGANIZATION> Checkpoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> on April 26, another .357 - caliber handgun from <PERSON> Scottie </PERSON>'s Guns & amp; <LOCATION> Militaria </LOCATION> on April 28, and a .38 - caliber All three dealers said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> stated on the forms that he was not a convicted felon. Federal law bars convicted felons from buying guns, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>. It also is a federal violation to advise someone else to break a federal law. On Monday, <PERSON> Martino </PERSON> went back to the Gun Room, returned the weapon, got a refund and told owner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> the purpose of the purchase. <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martino </PERSON> then asked him to destroy the federal firearms purchase form. Instead, <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> because, he said, destroying the purchase form is a federal offense. `` They set me up, and I do n't like that,'' he said. Channel 4 `` did n't rush headlong'' into the story, said news director <PERSON> Marv </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockford </PERSON>. `` We set out to show how easy it is for an ex-offender _ a convicted felon _ to purchase a firearm.'' He said the station had checked with lawyers and Police Chief <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavaras </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police endorsed the idea, but Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Zavaras </PERSON>, said the department `` declined to participate.''

<HEAD>Bush Jokes About Astrology Influence at White House</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush on Deukmejian as V.P., inserting 4 grafs
after 2nd graf pvs, The vice</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a Gemini, made light of reports of astrological influence at the White House on Thursday but suggested the issue was a `` two-edged sword'' because a large number of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe in the practice. The vice president also hinted jokingly that an astrologer claiming to have helped pick him as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s running mate in 1980 might be a useful member of his Cabinet. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> he would `` absolutely not'' rule out the state's governor, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, as a possible running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sharing the platform with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor at a news conference, reiterated an earlier assertion that he would not even begin to consider the selection process until after the Democratic convention in July. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, `` The respect I have for this governor has no limitation.'' On the subject of astrology, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I know it is a fascinating, titillating subject for all, with particular emphasis on the journalistic community.'' A spokesman, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, said the vice president, who has a lock on the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, `` does not consult astrologers or horoscopes or anything of the kind. He does n't even know where the horoscope is in the newspaper.'' Speaking to reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not checked his horoscope before beginning his three-day campaign swing through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` However, if you're interested, we're both Geminis,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to himself and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, both born in June. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s jocular retort matched the lighthearted manner in which other administration officials have responded to disclosures earlier this week of first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology. The disclosures are contained in an upcoming book by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who in the past has voiced disdain for `` kiss-and-tell'' books by former administration officials, said it was hard to respond to <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s specific allegations since the book has n't been published yet. `` I do n't think anyone knows what the charge, the allegation is,'' he said. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had consulted an astrologer on the president's plans for travel and scheduling However, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied that any of his decisions as president had been influenced by astrology. Asked about the disclosures on astrology and presidential scheduling, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know about that. But I'll tell you one thing: there are two edges to this sword.'' `` There are a helluva lot of people across this country that read these columns. Otherwise, they would n't be in the papers.'' Asked about <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> astrologer who contends she advised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign aides to select <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a running mate in 1980, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had never heard of her. But, he joked: `` I'll likely work closely with her. She's brilliant. Then, pretending he did n't quite get the name, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deadpanned, `` <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillson </PERSON>? Secretary of what?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke en route from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. He planned to spend the next three days campaigning in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, with events scheduled for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, campaign press secretary, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned two additional trips to the West coast between now and the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. `` We ca n't ignore the West,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said, even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination a week ago by piling up more than the 1,139 delegates needed at the party convention this August in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` We've got organizations in place and people on the ground that have been working for us. You've got to keep those troops energized,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in advance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s departure

<TEXT>
 La diferencia entre donar y recibir sangre 1. Donar sangre. Usted no esta ahora, ni ha estado nunca en peligo de adquirir el <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION> por donar sangre a un banco de sangre. Las agujas que se usan para las donaciones de sangre son nuevas. Una vez que se usan, son destruidas. No hay forma en que usted pueda entrar en contacto con el virus del SIDA por donar sangre. 2. Recibir sangre. El riesgo de adquirir el virus del SIDA por una transfusion de sangre ha sido reducido enormemente. Con el proposito de que el suministro de sangre sea lo mas seguro posible, se investiga a los donadores para detectar probables factores de riesgo; a la sangre donada se le hace la prueba de anticuerpos del SIDA. Si tiene alguna pregunta, llame a su banco de sangre.? Que clase de comportamiento lo pone a usted en riesgo? Usted tiene el riesgo de resultar infectado con el virus del <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION> si usted tiene relaciones sexuales con alguien que este infectado. Ya que usted no puede estar seguro de que alguien este infectado, el riesgo de estar en contacto con el virus aumenta con el numero de companeros sexuales que usted tenga. Cualquier intercambio de sangre, semen o fluidos vaginales infectados puede transmitir el virus y ponerlo a usted frente a un gran riesgo. Los siguientes comportamientos constituyen un riesgo cuando se practican con una persona infectada. Usted no puede saber a simple vista si una persona esta infectada. <ORGANIZATION> COMPORTAMIENTO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ARRIESGADO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compartir </ORGANIZATION> agujas y jeringas para inyectarse drogas. Contacto sexual anal, con o sin condon. Contacto vaginal u oral con una persona infectada, o con alquien ue se inyecte drogas o practique el sexo anal. Contacto con alguien que usted no conoce bien -LRB- un encuentro casual o una persona que practique la prostitucion -RRB- o con alguien que usted sabe que tiene varios companeros sexuales. Contacto sin proteccion -LRB- sin condon -RRB- con una persona infectada. COMPORTAMIENTO SEGURO No tener relaciones sexuales. Tener relaciones sexuales con una sola persona que no este infectada y ser mutuamente fieles. No inyectarse drogas.? Y hablando de citas? Tener citas y concoer a otras personas es algo normal en la vida. Tener una cita no es lo mismo que tener relaciones sexuales. El contacto sexual, como parte de una cita puede ser arriesgado. Uno de los riesgos es el SIDA -LRB- AIDS -RRB-.? Como puede usted saber si la persona con la que usted esta saliendo o le gustaria salir ha estado expuesta al virus del SIDA? Lo malo es que usted no puede saberlo. Pero lo bueno es, que mientras evite las relaciones sexuales y no comparta las agujas para inyectarse las drogas, no importa. Usted debe tener mucho cuidado con la persona con quien usted tenga relaciones sexuales, haciendo su propia decision sobre la persona, basandose en su buen juicio. Esto puede ser muy dificil.? Ha tenido esta persona alguna enfermedad sexualmente transmisible?? Con cuanta gente ha tenido relaciones sexuales?? Ha experimentado con drogas? Todas estas preguntas son delicadas, pero importantes. Pero usted tiene la responsabilidad personal de preguntar. Pienselo de esta manera. Si usted conoce a alguien lo suficiente como para tener relaciones sexuales, entonces usted deberia hablar francamente del SIDA. Si alguien se niega a hablar del SIDA, usted no deberia tener relaciones sexuales con esa persona.? <PERSON> Pueden </PERSON> las personas casadas adquirir el SIDA? Las personas casadas que no estan infectadas, que son fieles y que no se inyectan drogas no tienen ningun riesgo. Pero si siguen un comportamiento arriesgado -LRB- vea la pagina 3 -RRB- ellos podrian infectarse con el virus del <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION> e infectar a su pareja. Si usted cree que su conyuge pudiera estar poniendole en una situacion arriesgada, hable con el o ella. Es su vida.? Por que se habla tanto de los condones? No hace mucho tiemo, los condones -LRB- hule, la gomita, o preservativo -RRB- eran cosas de las que no hablabamos mucho. Ahora esto se discute en las noticias de la television o en la primer aplana de su periodico y los condones se exhiben libremente en su farmacia local, supermercado o tienda. Para aquellos sexualmente activos, que no limitan su actividad a una sola pareja, se ha demostrado que el uso de los conones ayuda a prevenir la diseminacion de enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles. Por eso se recomienda el uso de los condones para ayudar a reducir la transmision del SIDA. El uso de los condones es la mejor medida preventiva contra el SIDA, fuera de no tener relaciones sexuales y de practicar un compartamiento seguro -LRB- vea la pagina 3 -RRB-. <PERSON> Pero </PERSON> los condones no son absolutamente seguros. Usted debe de usarlos apropiadamente. Y usted debe usarlos cada vez que tenga relaciones sexuales, desde el principio hasta el final. Si usted usa un condon debe seguir las siguientes recomendaciones: -LRB- 1 -RRB- Use condones hechos de latex, ya que el latex sirve como una barrera para el virus. Los condones `` lambskin'' o `` natural membrane'' no son tan buenos por los poros en el material. Busque la palabra `` latex'' en el empaque. -LRB- 2 -RRB- Un condon con un espermicida puede proporcionarle proteccion adicional. Se ha demostrado en pruebas de laboratorio que los espericidas matan el virus del SIDA. Use el espermicida en el interior de la punta y en el exterior del condon. -LRB- 3 -RRB- El uso del condon es mas seguro con un lubricante. Revise la lista de ingredientes en la parte posterior del empaque del lubricante para estar seguro de que tenga base de agua -LRB- water-based -RRB-. No use lubricantes con base de petroleo, cold cream, aceite para bebes o manteca vegetal para cocinar. Estos pueden debilitar el condon y ser la causa de que se rompa.? Como luce una persona con SIDA? Es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede estar infectada con el virus del SIDA -LRB- AIDS -RRB- y no mostrar ningun sintoma. Es posible estar infectado por anos, sentirse bien, lucir bien y no tener manera de saber que usted esta infectado, a menos que a usted le hagan una prueba para el virus del SIDA. Este periodo en que uno esta infectado sin saberlo es una de las cosas que mas preocupan del SIDA. Durante este periodo, sin embargo, las personas infectadas con el virus del <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>, pueden transmitir el virus a sus companeros sexuales y a la gente con quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas. Las madres infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o durante el parto. Una vez que se presentan los sintromas, estos son similares a los de algunas otras enfermedades. Mientras la enfermedad progresa, los sintomas se vuelven mas serios, porque el virus del SIDA no permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar correctamente. Si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar infectado, usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede afectar a otros. Si usted cree que deberia hacerse una prueba de sangre para el virus del <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>, consulte a un doctor o a un consejero del SIDA para mas informacion. -LRB- <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> abajo. -RRB-? Hay una cura para el SIDA? Actualmente no hay cura para el <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>. Las medicinas, tales como AZT, han prolongado la vida de alguna gente con SIDA. Existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos tratamientos. Tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccion en gente que no esta infectada. Los investigadores creen que pasaran anos antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz. La manera mas eficaz para prevenir el SIDA es no exponerse al virus, cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento.

Ahora esto se discute en las noticias de la televisioon o en la primer aplana de su perioodico y los condones se exhiben libremente en su farmacia local, supermercado o tienda. Para aquellos sexualmente activos, que no limitan su actividad a una sola pareja, se ha demostrado que el uso de los conones ayuda a prevenir la diseminacioon de enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles. Por eso se recomienda el uso de los condones para ayudar a reducir la transmisioon del SIDA. El uso de los condones es la mejor medida preventiva contra el SIDA, fuera de no tener relaciones sexuales y de practicar un compartamiento seguro -LRB- vea la paagina 3 -RRB-. <PERSON> Pero </PERSON> los condones no son absolutamente seguros. Usted debe de usarlos apropiadamente. Y usted debe usarlos cada vez que tenga relaciones sexuales, desde el principio hasta el final. Si usted usa un condoon debe seguir las siguientes recomendaciones: -LRB- 1 -RRB- Use condones hechos de latex, ya que el latex sirve como una barrera para el virus. Los condones `` lambskin'' o `` natural membrane'' no son tan buenos por los poros en el material. Busque la palabra `` latex'' en el empaque. -LRB- 2 -RRB- Un condoon con un espermicida puede proporcionarle proteccioon adicional. Se ha demostrado en pruebas de laboratorio que los espericidas matan el virus del SIDA. Use el espermicida en el interior de la punta y en el exterior del condoon. -LRB- 3 -RRB- El uso del condoon es maas seguro con un lubricante. Revise la lista de ingredientes en la parte posterior del empaque del lubricante para estar seguro de que tenga base de agua -LRB- water-based -RRB-. No use lubricantes con base de petrooleo, cold cream, aceite para bebees o manteca vegetal para cocinar. Estos pueden debilitar el condoon y ser la causa de que se rompa.? Coomo luce una persona con SIDA? Es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede estar infectada con el virus del SIDA -LRB- AIDS -RRB- y no mostrar ninguun siintoma. Es posible estar infectado por annos, sentirse bien, lucir bien y no tener manera de saber que usted estaa infectado, a menos que a usted le hagan una prueba para el virus del SIDA. Este periiodo en que uno estaa infectado sin saberlo es una de las cosas que maas preocupan del SIDA. Durante este periiodo, sin embargo, las personas infectadas con el virus del <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>, pueden transmitir el virus a sus companneros sexuales y a la gente con quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas. Las madres infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o durante el parto. Una vez que se presentan los siintromas, estos son similares a los de algunas otras enfermedades. Mientras la enfermedad progresa, los siintomas se vuelven mas serios, porque el virus del SIDA no permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar correctamente. Si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar infectado, usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede afectar a otros. Si usted cree que deberiia hacerse una prueba de sangre para el virus del <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>, consulte a un doctor o a un consejero del SIDA para maas informacioon. -LRB- <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> abajo. -RRB-? Hay una cura para el SIDA? Actualmente no hay cura para el <ORGANIZATION> SIDA </ORGANIZATION>. Las medicinas, tales como AZT, han prolongado la vida de alguna gente con SIDA. Existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos tratamientos. Tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccioon en gente que no estaa infectada. Los investigadores creen que pasaraan annos antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz. La manera maas eficaz para prevenir el SIDA es no exponerse al virus, cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Wednesday named the largest delegation of Roman Catholic clergymen ever to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as representatives at a major religious celebration next month. The high-level group of 13 includes 10 cardinals, among them <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> hierarchy after the pope. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has often expressed the desire to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> earlier disclosed that the invitation from the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend to the pope. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials and bishops from various parts of the world will be attending the celebrations marking the millenium of Christianity's arrival in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Although the invitation was in the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the naming of such a top-level delegation clearly demonstrates an attempt by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to improve relations with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, in announcing the names, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> attaches great importance to the event and hopes it will open `` new paths toward reconciliation, peace and justice of which humanity has so much need. `` In addition to <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation includes Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, a Dutchman who heads the secretariat for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, and Cardinal <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Etchegaray </PERSON>, the French president of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> The delegation also includes cardinals <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, Roman Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>; Julijans Vaivods of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>; <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, retired archbishop of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. It also includes Archbishop <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Paskai </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, Bishop <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, head of the Latin American bishops conference; and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonsum </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganaka </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, representing <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the delegation was not only the largest group of <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> prelates to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but was also the first <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation ever to get a formal invitation, although <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> and other churchmen have visited individually in the past. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> could not recall such a large church delegation ever attending a single event anywhere. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said that while <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Etchegary </PERSON> would only attend the main celebration in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> would represent the Holy See at all events. The pope has said often that he would travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> only if he could visit his flock throughout the country, specifically the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhastan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>NRC Proposing Rules Change That Could Lead To Seabrook Low-Power
License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-0 Wednesday to propose a rules change that would allow the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, reactor to obtain a low-power operating license without a siren system to warn nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents in an emergency. The proposal, which will be subject to a 30-day public comment period before a final <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> vote, would apply to any plants seeking a 5 percent power license, but was aimed at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> blocked a low-power permit for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> because there was no siren system in place for the six <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities that fall within a 10-mile evacuation zone around the southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> plant. The rules change would allow <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owners to obtain the low-power license and go ahead with testing while trying to get approval of an alternate siren system. An approved warning system would still be necessary to obtain a full-power license. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, the plant's operator, was forced to remove its <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> sirens last year after a federal appeals court sided with local officials. State and local officials led by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believe no evacuation system can adequately protect nearby residents, and are fighting to block the plant's opening. The company's new alert plan includes truck-mounted sirens and siren-equipped helicopters as a backup. Critics say the license issue has grown more critical for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owners, fearing the beleaguered reactor will never be approved if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected president. The idle $ 5.4 billion plant is losing $ 50 million each month in maintenance and finance costs, plant officials say. Current NRC rules do not specify off-site safety requirements to obtain a low-power license, but a 1982 commission `` explanation'' of the rules does. The rules have been widely interpreted to require an off-site alert system such as sirens for low-power licensing. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff, in recommending the rules change, cited the `` low risk'' involved in low-power testing. But critics led by Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., complain that the risk has not changed since 1982, and therefore there is no legitimate reason to change the regulations In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> applauded the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> decision, saying it `` correctly addresses the very low risk of low-power operation.'' Commissioner <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernthal </PERSON> did not vote because he is leaving the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> soon for a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post, said commission spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A man who owns a tropical fish business was arrested Wednesday and accused of smuggling 700 baby boa constrictors into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, authorities said. The snakes, which are a protected species in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, were concealed in five boxes that were part of an otherwise-legal shipment of fish that arrived March 7 at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. The snakes, 21 inches long, were discovered during an inspection by agents of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the airport. The shipment was addressed to <PERSON> Agremiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Espana </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Miro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholesale tropical fish business. He was charged with violating the federal Lacey Act, which outlaws the interstate or foreign transportation of illegally captured wildlife. The charge carries a maximum sentence upon conviction of five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine. Under Colombian law, it is illegal to export boa constrictors, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, a special agent with the wildlife service. The snakes are a protected species under the Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, a treaty to which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a party. All but 38 have been returned to their natural habitat in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>. The rest will be used in the prosecution of the case and may eventually be given to American zoos. The snakes were all newborns, <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said. He said baby boas can be bought in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for about $ 5 and resold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for as much as $ 200. Adult boa constrictors, which grow up to 15 feet in length, bring much higher prices. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said boa constrictors are very popular among amateur herpetologists because of their docile temperament and because they are increasingly difficult to obtain.

 A series of explosions at a space shuttle fuel plant rocked this southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> city Wednesday, destroying the facility and a marshmallow plant, killing at least one person, injuring 96 and leaving scores of others missing. Flames and orange smoke rose 100 feet into the sky and buildings shook 10 miles away in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> after the midday explosions at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The plant manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the accident was not expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights. `` What we see is pretty much total devastation,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, an executive at the plant. All roads to <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a town of 25,000 midway between <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hoover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, were closed because of concern that toxic gases might escape. At the command post near the blast site, <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> said at least one person had been killed. Emergency workers were forced to stand by for fear of additional explosions. State records showed 125 people worked at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> while the next-door Kid Marshmallow Plant employed 85, but few employees of either plant had been seen at hospitals, authorities said. `` There are people out there who are probably dying,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Mercy Ambulance in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, whose company dispatched ambulances to the site. `` This is going to be a daylong and nightlong event because no fire unit has been out there. `` People are out there on the desert wandering aimlessly'' if they were lucky enough to have escaped, she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said 96 injured people had been brought in. He said most of the injuries were minor but at least three were critical. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, asked if toxic products could have leaked, said the plant's ammonia tanks could not be seen. `` We ca n't tell at the moment whether these tanks are secure.'' `` One of our pieces of equipment malfunctioned and caught on fire. The fire spread quickly and there was an explosion,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. At least two blasts followed the main blast within seconds. He said the smoke was so thick he could n't see if any of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s buildings were still standing. `` I suspect there are none,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. Emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke billowed across the entire <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. All schools in the area were evacuated and closed for the day, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> made an emergency appeal for contributions to help victims, and hospital workers were called in or put on standby throughout the area. One victim with an open skull fracture was being flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON>, Life Flight helicopter dispatcher. `` Our windows blew out. It blew the frame off the door. We are probably five or six miles away. The thing is on fire,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Henderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convalescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said hospital officials were checking for injured patients and employees. `` A window blew up in somebody's face,'' she said. Several people injured in the blast were taken to nearby <LOCATION> Saint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the explosion also shattered windows, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said many patients were cut and bruised. `` The windows blew. The workers are helping the patients,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. `` It's near here and all we can see is the black cloud of smoke.'' In <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, buildings shook and a huge plume of smoke was visible in the air. People leaving offices for the noon hour stood on the streets, gawking at the smoke. A worker at <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said he was deep inside the dam when the blast rattled windows at the power plant in the belly of the facility. He did not feel the dam itself shake. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, an engineer who was less than two miles from the plant site, said he heard three blasts, the first `` worse than any sonic boom. I thought it was a plane crash but there was too much smoke.'' He said the second blast five minutes later `` almost knocked us over'' and when the third hit, he crawled under a desk. `` I thought it was a nuclear bomb.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> provides the ammonium perchlorate to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s prime contractor for the motors, as well as to some <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> programs. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Amitor </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Morton-Thiokol </PERSON> had enough ammonium perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989. <PERSON> Amidor </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> plant, also in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, is capable of making enough ammonium perchlorate for boosters to support eight space shuttle flights a year.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, abandoning his harsh criticism of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, credited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday with making progress on human rights and said gradual improvements were ` better than no change at all.'' Striking a conciliatory tone in a pre-summit address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> readily acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has its own problems with homelessness, racial discrimination and unemployment, as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has charged. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks appeared intended to soothe Soviet anger about his demand for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to `` tear down a wall of oppression'' and his claim that the Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was being made under pressure. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month he was tired of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s sermons And the Soviet government accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of `` imperial arrogance.'' In his remarks to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> group, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went out of his way to credit <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with loosening restrictions on religion, freedom of speech and emigration. `` We applaud the changes that have taken place and encourage the Soviets to go farther,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We recognize that changes occur slowly but that is better than no change at all.'' In a brief question and answer session with the audience, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was willing to give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` the benefit of the doubt, up to a point'' _ that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader sincerely wants to achieve the program of economic and social reforms known as `` glasnost.'' The president said he believed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was pursuing the reforms because of economic problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he hoped he could offer <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at this month's U.S.-Soviet summit some suggestions as to how he could move ahead with glasnost `` That, I think, is preferable to staging a kind of contest with him so that someone looks like a winner or loser,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He also expressed a dream `` to rid the world'' of nuclear weapons. He compared the danger of nuclear weapons with a hypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a power from outer space. `` Would n't we all of a sudden find that we did n't have any differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens of the world, and would n't we come together to fight that particular threat?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech was part of a series of addresses intended to frame the issues he will highlight at the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> May 29-June 2. His audience was the National Strategy Forum, a non-partisan organization that sponsors educational programs on national security and foreign policy issues. The president said the Soviets have had `` limited successes'' in improving their economy. `` I do not bring this up simply for the sake of sounding critical,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said he mentioned it because of a development `` of tremendous significance'' in recent months, that the Soviets themselves are beginning to talk about shortages in their country. On human rights, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said some 300 political and religious prisoners had been released from labor camps over the last three years, and that the incarceration of dissidents in mental hospitals and prisons had slowed, and in some cases, stopped. `` And while the press remains tightly controlled by the -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party and the state, we've seen the publication of stories on topics that used to be forbidden _ topics like crime, drug addiction, corruption, even police brutality,'' the president said. `` These changes are limited and the basic standards contained in the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords still are not being met,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added. Underscoring his theme, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We welcome the human rights progress the Soviets have made and believe there is good reason to hope for still more.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said there is no guarantee that the progress is permanent. He said the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> `` loosened things up a bit'' but that it was reversed later. `` And for the nearly three decades until our own day, oppression and stagnation once again became the determining characteristics of Soviet life,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And just as previous hopeful moments in Soviet history ended all too soon, so, too, ` glasnost' _ today's new candor _ will succeed if the Soviets take steps to make it permanent, to institutionalize it,'' he said. Asked by reporters about the softened tone of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s rhetoric, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said the speech was different because the topic was different, such as human rights versus regional issues. `` Is there anything wrong with saying since 1985 we've seen things that are positive and we hope to see more?'' he said. In an April 21 speech in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Two of the most basic rights that we have called on the Soviets to comply with are the right to emigrate and the right to travel. How can we help but doubt a government that mistrusts its own people and holds them against their will? ... `` In the new spirit of openness, why does n't the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government issue passports to its citizens? I think this would dramatically improve U.S.-Soviet relations.'' The speech led to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s complaint to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sermonizing.

 More than four tons of cocaine was discovered in hollowed-out <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> lumber bound for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, federal authorities announced Wednesday. An anonymous letter from <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, tipped drug agents that the freighter <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> would be smuggling the cocaine, which is expected to total 8,800 pounds, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. `` If true, it would represent the largest cocaine seizure in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. `` We're at 6,000 pounds and still counting.'' The largest previous seizure, found stuffed into picnic furniture in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, was 8,700 pounds. The cocaine is believed to have been imported by what <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents call the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION>. The group `` is a world-class competitor of the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>,'' the violent <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> gang responsible for up to 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cocaine imports, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> DEA office. Three men _ two Colombians and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> _ have been arrested, authorities said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> warehouse where the cocaine-filled lumber was taken, <PERSON> Fredy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarez </PERSON> were charged with conspiracy to import and to distribute the cocaine. <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>, 60, is reputedly an associate of two top <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> leaders, according to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> files. The cocaine entered the country aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> in a shipment of Brazilian cedar, authorities said. The ship, after loading up in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, stopped in <LOCATION> Leticia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. There, Cash said, an estimated 800 to 1,000 people must have hollowed out the lumber packed the cocaine in styrofoam containers, stuffed them inside and resealed the lumber. The shipment then went down the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and arrived at <LOCATION> Bayboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> on April 19. There, under <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> surveillance because of the February letter from <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, part of the lumber was unloaded and taken to <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>' warehouse. The confiscated cocaine was headed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, Cash said.

<HEAD>Man Arrested Six Years After Losing Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHUAC, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For six years <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeand </PERSON> went on with his life, thinking an appeals court had cleared him of an armed robbery conviction. But recently an arrest warrant with his name on it surfaced and now he is in jail, awaiting transfer to serve a five-year prison term for robbing a convenience store a decade ago. As it turns out, the appellate court had rejected his appeal and the paperwork apparently got lost. Part of the confusion likely resulted from the death of his attorney, former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker Price <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was shot and killed a few months after McKeand's trial. Then <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s assistant in the case, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, relocated <PERSON> McKeand </PERSON>, 29, who was arrested last week, had made no attempt to hide. He had continued to list his number in the telephone book while working as an oil rigger. `` Everybody knows what he did was wrong,'' said his sister-in-law, <PERSON> Rayleene </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeand </PERSON>, 24. `` But the courts should have taken care of it right then before he'd built a new life. Everybody changes after 10 years.'' `` I remember he was very young and did n't have a record. He was n't a big-time bandit,'' said State District Judge <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilborn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who prosecuted McKeand. <PERSON> McKeand </PERSON> and another teen-ager, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Williard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, used a shotgun to rob a convenience store of $ 100 on July 2, 1978. They were pulled over by police 1 -LCB- hours later, confessed and turned over the money and weapon. <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, who agreed to a three-year sentence in a plea bargain and testified against McKeand, was released from prison in 1981 after serving 11 months. McKeand's mother, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeand </PERSON>, said some community business leaders have offered to write a letter asking that her son be pardoned or paroled. She said her son's attorneys had not told him that the appeal of the 1979 conviction had been denied in 1982 and a warrant had been issued for his arrest. She said her son now has an acre or so of land with a mobile home and recently bought a truck. McKeand, married with a 5-year-old son, separated from his wife this year after seven years. He was looking forward to his son visiting him during the summer, his mother said. Court records show an arrest warrant was issued Oct. 6, 1982. The warrant was later returned unserved from the sheriff's office. `` These things sometimes happen,'' said Sheriff C.E. `` Chuck'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` We handle about 100 warrants per month. There's a horrendous workload. I do n't know whether a secretary misplaced it or what.'' The appellate court was reviewing its records last month and noticed it had never been notified about McKeand's arrest. It sent a letter to the district clerk, the error was discovered and a new warrant issued.

 Word that city funds will be withheld from the Cinco de Mayo parade if presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is its grand marshal has angered a parade organizer.

Association director <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said withholding the city money could cost the group $ 14,000 and would be hypocritical because politicians such as Mayor -LRB- then Assemblyman -RRB- <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, former Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, state Sen. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> and other politicians have participated in the parade _ some as grand marshal.

<HEAD>Texas Air Chief Sees Eastern Losses Continuing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the turmoil surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> `` continues to ravage'' the financial performance of the air carrier, with losses expected through the first half of this year. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, will post continuing losses during the second quarter. He blamed it in part on the airline unions' campaign against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the refusal by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union to agree to concessions and the series of government investigations of the Miami-based airline, which has been in the center of labor turmoil for years. `` The present environment is having a serious impact on Eastern. It continues to ravage the financial results and the future of this great airline,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. `` Currently we are looking at very sizable and continuing losses in the second quarter because of all the activities that are taking place and their impact on travelers.'' Eastern has not made public its financial results for the first quarter of 1988, although <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> officials have made clear that the carrier lost money. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 181.6 million, including a staggering $ 143 million in losses during the fourth quarter. Eastern's president, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, several weeks ago acknowledged that the airline was losing some bookings because of the recently announced <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigations into the carrier's safety procedures and its labor battles. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said Wednesday that he welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation and said he anticipates it `` will put into perspective the misinformation and nonsense that's been peddled to the media, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announced it was seeking $ 823,000 in penalties from Eastern for past safety violations and that it was beginning a plane-by-plane inspection of the carrier. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that the Eastern inspections are expected to be complete in about a week. He said inspectors continue to uncover some infractions requiring corrective action in 7 percent to 8 percent of the planes checked. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that while in many of those cases the planes had to be taken out of service briefly, he did not consider the percentage of infractions unusually high. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> characterized the problems found by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors so far as minor and said they likely would have been discovered by airline employees had the government inspectors not been present.

 Medical, health and education groups hailed the government's new AIDS booklet Wednesday as clear, direct and compassionate, and said it should be required reading for all Americans. The pamphlet, `` Understanding AIDS,'' was developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> under orders from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and will be sent to every household with a mailing address on May 26. Despite some grumbling over the length of time it took to produce the eight-page pamphlet, there was almost unanimous praise for its content. `` This pamphlet should be required reading for every American citizen,'' the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` Everyone who reads this mailer will understand the disease better, and I hope this understanding will lead to urgency and compassion, and replace panic and fear,'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., said in a statement headlined `` At long last, information. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, said the booklet comes `` years after any reasonable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> would have expected it'' and two years later than similar efforts by other nations such as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He said it took two acts of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pry the information loose from what he termed `` White House censors.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expressly prohibited the booklet receiving clearance from anyone outside HHS. The pamphlet says people can not get AIDS from casual contact such as kisses, mosquito bites, sweat, tears, clothes, telephones or toilet seats. It also describes explicitly how the AIDS virus enters the body and what can be done to minimize risk, including instructions on the correct use of condoms. Amid the chorus of approval, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., disputed the booklet's assertions and said it would mislead the public `` You get the impression that none of us have anything to fear from associating with people who have the virus, ARC -LRB- AIDS-related complex -RRB- or AIDS. Nothing could be further from the truth,'' <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> said. `` The report should not go out to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Asked why Americans should listen to him rather than the battery of scientists, doctors and others endorsing the pamphlet, <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> said public health officials have exercised questionable judgment so far in handling the AIDS crisis. He said they have n't shut down homosexual bathhouses or required that infected individuals be reported to authorities by name, among other things, and said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been poorly served by his health appointees But <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON> was a lonely voice of protest. The pamphlet won praise from a diverse range of interest groups ranging from gay organizations to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, labor unions to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, called the booklet long overdue and `` generally a very positive step. It is compassionate, accurate, straightforward and non-judgmental. The strong statements about casual contact are particularly important.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>, said the booklet is `` highly readable for youth'' and will help families discuss AIDS `` in a candid yet friendly framework.'' The material is specific and may offend some people, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` But in dealing with matters of life and death, sensibilities should not dictate educational efforts aimed at prevention,'' she said. In addition to being mailed to all American households, the AIDS booklet will be available at Planned Parenthood clinics and other facilities. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON>, president of Planned Parenthood, called the pamphlet a `` frank and thorough guide'' that her group is happy to distribute. `` We are pleased and relieved that this nation is finally acknowledging that the AIDS epidemic is a health issue, not a moral issue,'' she said in a statement.

<HEAD>Actress Calls For Medicare Coverage Of Mammogram Tests For Breast
Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> teamed up with medical experts Wednesday to call for Medicare coverage of mammogram screening tests to detect breast cancer in older women. `` Although I am a professional actress and entertainer, I speak to you today not as a public figure but as a private person _ a woman who has many female family members and friends for whom breast cancer remains an ever-present threat and concern,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee. `` Mammography can pick up many breast cancers when they're very small, even before they can be felt,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` But for economic reasons, mammography is n't accessible to many of the women who need it.'' She said that making the tests more readily available `` makes sense for financial as well as humanitarian reasons,'' because early detection of breast cancers avoids the high costs to treat cancers discovered later. `` All of us can help in our own way to bring about this needed change,'' she said. `` All of us have a stake in making it happen _ because we are women, or because the lives of women important to us are affected by the issue.'' Ms. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appeared alongside Dr. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, president and director of <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, before the subcommittee on labor, health and human services and education and related agencies. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said Medicare, most Medicaid programs, and the majority of private insurers do not pay for routine screening mammograms, only for tests that are performed after symptoms of breast cancer have appeared. He said the cost of the test, averaging at least $ 100, is `` a significant deterrent to utilization of mammography by many of the women who need it.'' Because 40 percent of all breast cancers occur in women over age 65 and the risk of breast cancer climbs 15 percent for every five years of age after 65, `` it is essential that women in the Medicare-age population receive annual screening mammograms to detect tumors in the early, most treatable stage,'' he said.

 Two congressmen moved Wednesday to protect a historic Civil War battlefield, introducing legislation for the federal government to purchase the land next to the battle site in order to block a planned shopping center. The bill, authored by Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, would direct the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to purchase from a developer a 600-acre plot of land adjacent to the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where two important Civil War battles were fought. The congressmen, who are Civil War buffs, say plans for a 1.2 million square-foot shopping center would violate the battlefield site. `` We've come to this conclusion because both of us feel there's no other choice,'' said <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> `` Both of us are convinced that the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping mall.'' The land-purchase bill comes a week after <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> attached language to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations panel supplemental spending bill that would block any federal highway money for road improvements associated with the shopping complex. The 3,800-acre <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> battlefield, about 27 miles west of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was the site of the first significant land battle of the Civil War in 1861. In a second, three-day battle in 1862, 24,000 Union and Confederate casualties were recorded, as Union forces that had been as far south as <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> 60 days earlier were pushed back into the nation's capital. The battles, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> as the Battles of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, helped convince <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> officials that the war would be a protracted affair. Developers originally sought to build the shopping center on a plot of land where historians say Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had his battle headquarters, but have met with opposition from local preservationists. Last Thursday, Hazel-Peterson Companies agreed to move the complex a short distance away, at the suggestion of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> rejected that move. `` I do n't think that compromise is what we're looking for at the battlefield,'' said <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, who noted that the developer has upgraded plans for the development several times. `` I do n't think the property ought to be desecrated, and that's what we view it as.'' The land-purchase bill will be referred to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. French Slaughter, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., whose district includes the battlefield site, has not yet studied the land-purchase bill, but would support a move to reroute roads now running through the battlefield, he said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were unavailable for comment on the latest proposal. In addition to asking the federal government to use its right of eminent domain to acquire the land, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he will ask his panel to reexamine tax breaks given to developers building near national park sites. `` The question is, are we really going to protect the buffer zones around national parks,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> asked. `` This is an egregious example of where developers have been invited in by the local politicians.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said he hoped to move the bill out of committee and onto the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by July.

 An attorney for a woman who got AIDS during a 1983 transfusion charged Wednesday that the blood bank that supplied the tainted blood neglected to take adequate precautions against the deadly disease. <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s lawsuit against a blood bank and two doctors opened Wednesday before a six-person jury in <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Similar suits have been filed, but lawyers said this may be the first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an AIDS victim's claim against a blood bank. In a 1986 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case, a jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the trial ended. `` It was just like a time bomb, waiting to send an AIDS virus into a person's body. That person turned out to be <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said of the plasma supplied to his client after she was injured in a gun accident. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said in his opening statement Wednesday that testimony would show the doctor who treated <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> used the blood bank's plasma despite offers by family members to share their blood because of their concern about AIDS <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Dolores </LOCATION>, is suing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, whose blood bank in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, supplied the contaminated blood; Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s doctor; and Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> infectious disease expert who first tested <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> for exposure to AIDS. The defendants' attorneys planned opening statements later. The doctors have defended their treatment of <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> as proper, and a lawyer for the blood bank previously said that tests for detecting AIDS in blood were not available until two years after the woman was infected. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> is presiding over the case, which began with jury selection on Monday. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 53, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, claims his wife's illness affected the couple's sex life and potentially exposed him to AIDS as well. The Quintanas seek `` substantial damages,'' but their lawsuit does not name an amount, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> has had full-blown AIDS since September 1987, but her husband's tests have been negative, said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> has not had an easy time since <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> was told she has AIDS,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Thank goodness he's not infected, but they did n't know that at the time'' they had sexual relations after the transfusion. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> was brought to <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cortez </LOCATION> in May 1983 for treatment of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot wound, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> was the doctor who treated her, he said. `` One hour later, that unit of frozen plasma was put into <PERSON> Susie </PERSON>'s body,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` You are going to hear evidence that over that one-hour period that <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s eldest son -RRB- could have given blood, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s husband -RRB- could have given blood.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was aware as early as January 1983 of the need to make blood safe from AIDS, identifying male homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers as high-risk groups. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, he said, issued a joint statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations following a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> meeting that January that recommended ways for the public to avoid contaminated blood. But he said the statement failed to call for blood donors to be asked about their sexual preference. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> initially tested <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> for exposure to AIDS and told her the tests were negative, and <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> that his wife did not have AIDS exposure. Biopsy tests performed in fall 1985 confirmed that <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> had been exposed to the AIDS virus, said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.

 What was planned as a quick, surprise strike at guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> encountered stiff resistance, leading some Israeli experts to question the wisdom of the operation. Israeli officials initially said the operation that began Monday night was small in scale and would last only about 24 hours, but <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Wednesday the soldiers were in a tough battle. An army announcement later said the operation ended Wednesday night with three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers dead and 17 wounded. It said more than 40 guerrillas were killed, nearly all in <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> village, a stronghold of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. At first, the primary objective appeared to be convincing villagers not to provide guides and other aid to guerrillas, who have made a dozen raids across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border since last November. A military source said privately, however, that `` the original plan changed'' when the guerrillas stood and fought. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said Israeli officials were angry about information leaks just before troops entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under cover of darkness. `` Early publication of the army operation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> without the approval of military censorship chased away hundreds of guerrillas who were the main objective of the operation, and in fact caused the main goal of the operation to fail,'' the independent daily said. Some military analysts who criticized the mission said it may encourage more attacks across the frontier rather than deterring the guerrillas. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The results wo n't be very significant.'' He said guerrilla activity in the past two decades `` shows that after military actions like this, they'll just try harder again against us just to make a show of force.'' <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> also expressed doubt that the thrust to within a few miles of Syrian army lines in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would encourage <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to control the guerrillas. `` It's very likely that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is not impressed by this operation,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, former chief of army intelligence, predicted the guerrillas would only suffer a temporary setback. In an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television interview, he said: `` The immediate achievement will be a relative calming down and decline in attempts to infiltrate and attack for the not too distant future.'' <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> also said: `` We will have to repeat such operations to prevent the guerrillas from reorganizing in the area.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ended a three-year occupation of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985. Many Israelis were left with deep suspicions about future military entanglements, and the new operation raised immediate questions. `` It's always easier to go in than it is to come out,'' Transportation Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfu </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Military commentator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Yishai </PERSON> predicted in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> that guerrillas would resume and even redouble their efforts to get into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Palestinian guerrilla groups will continue military action to show support for Palestinians who have rebelled for five months against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, an expert on terrorism at the independent <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said the effect of such a quick thrust would not last long, especially without the element of surprise. `` The main achievement is immediate if it comes as a surprise,'' he said. `` If it does n't come as a surprise, what remains, and that is doubtful, is deterrence of the local population from cooperating with terrorists.''

 An electronic implant in the inner ear has not restored full hearing to any of the 3,000 profoundly deaf who have received the device, but it has provided at least some help to most patients, a panel of experts concluded Wednesday. The device, called a cochlear implant, uses electrodes implanted in the middle ear to send impulses to the hearing nerve. The impulses are created by amplified sounds which are picked up by a microphone from outside the body and relayed to the electrodes. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> panel that examined the use and success of the cochlear implant during a conference this week, reported Wednesday that though results from the device have been mixed, there is a promise of improvement as the technology develops. `` Reports have sometimes claimed a spectacular return of normal hearing in deaf people with cochlear implants,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, chairman of the panel and a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` Unfortunately, to date, no person can be documented to have had normal hearing restored by this device.'' The committee report said that less than 1 percent of the 15 million hearing-impaired Americans are potential candidates for the cochlear implant. Those who could use the device, the committee said, should be profoundly deaf adults who receive no benefit from hearing aids, who previously could hear and speak, who are in generally good health and who have the intelligence and psychological strength to learn how to interpret the sounds detected by the implant. Of the 3,000 who have received the implant, the report said, only about 5 percent have experienced an improvement sufficient for them to communicate without lip reading. About 60 percent to 70 percent have experienced what the group called `` significant improvement.'' Another 2 percent to 15 percent of the patients have stopped using the device because they found it irritating or unhelpful. The rest received more limited improvement. Using the device on children is still controversial, the committee said, though about 20 centers around the country are putting the implant in young children on an experimental basis. Estimated cost of the procedure is $ 10,000 to $ 20,000. The group said there was great difficulty in predicting prior to surgery who will benefit and who will not. Some patients have had such success with the implant that they can talk on the phone, while others, who appeared to be equally fit candidates, have not benefited. A patient wearing the implant hears static and buzzing sounds that vary in intensity and tone. The patient must learn to interpret these sensations as sound. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumacher </PERSON>, 67, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> man who received a cochlear implant in 1980, was asked by the panel Wednesday to explain what he `` hears'' from his implant. `` It sounds like a radio that is just a little off center,'' like static, he said. <PERSON> Shumacher </PERSON> said he is able to understand some speech although he has one major problem. When people tell jokes, he said, their voices tend to drop when they come to the end. `` So I sometimes miss the punchline,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A federal court jury convicted the reputed boss of the Genovese organized crime family and eight others Wednesday of a massive racketeering scheme that rigged multimillion-dollar bids in the construction industry. But in an apparent setback for a government effort to oust the current leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, <ORGANIZATION> Genovese </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> and two others were acquitted of tampering with national Teamsters elections. Federal prosecutors and defense lawyers declined to comment on the verdict, citing a judicial gag order. The order remains in effect because the jury will reconvene next week to consider forfeiture proceedings against the convicted defendants. Teamsters officials proclaimed the verdict a vindication. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, 77, who is already serving a 100-year prison term for a 1986 conviction, and eight of 10 co-defendants were convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, both of which carry maximum 20-year prison terms. In all, <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> was convicted on 28 counts, including extortion, mail fraud and illegal gambling in addition to racketeering. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> grimaced slightly and sat down after his conviction on the first count was announced. He saluted the jury from his seat when they acquitted him on the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> charges. He was acquitted on a total of five counts, including wire fraud for allegedly engineering the 1983 election of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and his predecessor, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, as president of the 1.7 million-member Teamsters. Reputed Cleveland mobster <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Peanuts'' Tronolone and <LOCATION> Clevelad </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> `` Maishe'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> also were acquitted of tampering with Teamsters elections. It was not immediately known what affect the acquittals would have on reported plans for a government civil suit to seek the ouster of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> officials because the union is allegedly `` extensively influenced'' by mobsters. Sources in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said the suit was drawn up but not filed to avoid prejudicing the <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has declined to confirm those reports and would not comment Wednesday because of the gag order. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could not be reached immediately for commen after the verdict. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Teamster officials said the verdict `` once and forever'' shatters law officials' claims that organized crime figures engineered the elevation of first <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> to the union's presidency. Teamster General Counsel <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and other top officials of the union `` feel vindicated ... and are comforted by the fact that after over one year of testimony, this jury was able to accurately ferret out the truth.'' `` For the past two years, it has been widely reported, first through calculated media leaks, and then through the use of innuendo and even perjured testimony, that the elections of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> had been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements,'' <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> said. `` Today that myth has been once and forever shatttered by the jury verdict in the <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> case.'' Tronolone and <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> were acquitted of all charges against them, including racketeering, conspiracy and wire fraud. In addition to <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, those convicted of racketeering were: four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area businessmen, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Auletta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chattin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>; two other alleged Genovese capos, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> `` Matty the Horse'' Ianniello and <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNapoli </PERSON>; <PERSON> DiNapoli </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>; and reputed Lucchese crime family capo <PERSON> Aniello </PERSON> `` Neil'' <PERSON> Migliore </PERSON> Various defendants were convicted of rigging bids on numerous construction projects including more than $ 30 million in concrete work for the <ORGANIZATION> Jacob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Javits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. It took the court clerk and jury forewoman nearly an hour to work their way through the 40-page verdict sheet. The jury began deliberating April 26.

<TEXT>
 Federal agencies that fail to require seat-belt use on roads running through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> parks and other lands will be called before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to explain why, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman said. Wednesday. `` Obviously, this administration has not been willing to show the best example when it comes to federal areas and belt use,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, vowed to use his subcommittee on oversight and investigation to force greater seat-belt use in government. He said he would call in representatives of federal agencies to explain the rule-making process. `` If the example wo n't come from the administration, perhaps the example will come from the oversight committee,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has cooperated in his campaign to require seat-belt use, but civilian agencies `` are more recalcitrant.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proposed `` a seat-belt use requirement as part of a revamping of its safety rules,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. `` However, when the rules were finalized, this requirement was quietly dropped.'' The Park Service in a letter said the proposed rule was removed because of adverse public comment, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. Further investigation showed `` that all but one of those comments came from the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringgold </PERSON>, said the agency follows state law in determining seat-belt use. Where states require seat belts, the parks also require them; where states have no such requirement, neither does the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our philosophy ... was that states were the appropriate authorities to regulate traffic and that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> traffic regulations should be limited to situations that are either unique to park areas or that are not consistently addressed by state traffic regulations,'' <PERSON> Ringgold </PERSON> said. Also, the public would be confused by mandatory seat-belt use in parks situated in states lacking such a requirement, <PERSON> Ringgold </PERSON> said. More than half the parks administered by the service require seat belts be worn, <PERSON> Ringgold </PERSON> said. About 8,000 miles of public road run through <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land, he said. Thirty-three states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have enacted laws requiring seat-belt use, `` but the public has been lukewarm to the use of seat belts, despite their known and obvious benefits,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> on Wednesday openly confronted rumors that have spread since the apparent suicide Sunday of his top aide, firmly denying that either he or the aide, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, was homosexual. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and I were very, very good friends. He was like a brother. We had a personal and professional relationship,'' the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrat said at a news conference three days after <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> apparently jumped to his death from the 24th floor of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel. `` Was he -LRB- <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> -RRB- a homosexual?'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> was asked. `` No, he was not,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> replied. To the same question about himself, he responded firmly and without emotion, `` No, I am not.'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> jumped to his death because he could see his reputation being ruined by a story in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> forced young male staffers to attend social functions he arranged, fired one staffer who refused to stay at a staff party and asked another male staffer to perform a strip-tease at an office retreat. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> complained that the story was based on interviews with a few disgruntled former staffers and gave only one side of the story. He said he does n't think publicity about <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, including earlier stories that he failed to properly report payments he received from campaign funds, will hurt his chances of beating a little-known Republican opponent, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilchrest </PERSON>, in November. `` I am ready to go. I love campaigning,'' he said. He said he could not answer questions about the campaign funds because Repubicans have lodged a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Until the news conference, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, 39, had been in seclusion since the 46-year-old <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> died. The two men, and a third staffer, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Skipper </PERSON>, were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the weekend. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said he talked with <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> after the story was read to him Sunday and that `` he seemed to be holding up very well.'' He said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> denied the allegations in the story, but knew that `` the damage had been done.'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> was totally devoted to him and the 1st Congressional District. `` I think he sensed he was losing it,'' he said. A note left in the hotel room by <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> `` did not seem like a suicide note to me,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said. The note was not addressed to anyone and did not mention any names, he said. Addressing specific incidents in the Post story, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said he has discussed them with other staffers since Sunday and `` they have shed a distinctly different light'' on them. He said he does not remember <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> ordering an aide to perform a strip tease although he was present at the retreat where the incident allegedly happened. Other staffers told him there is a different explanation for that incident, he said, but he refused to discuss it, saying `` in time we'll get to that.'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> also discussed the firing of aide <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hira </PERSON> when he refused to remain at a party at an <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> hotel earlier this year.

<TEXT>
 Israeli soldiers shelled a Syrian army garrison Wednesday and used tanks to chase pro-Iranian guerrillas from villages, then <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> announced that its two-day invasion of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was over. The Israeli military command in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> reported three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and more than 40 Arab guerrillas killed and 17 Israeli troopers wounded. It said all Israeli forces had returned to their bases. Israeli artillery shelled the 50-man Syrian garrison at <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> while other units were storming a nearby town with tanks, driving out guerrillas and knocking down houses. Whether the shelling was deliberate was not clear, and the Syrians did not shoot back. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s state radio quoted a Syrian general in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, who was not identified, as saying: `` We are watching closely. We shall fight them if they make further advances.'' No casualties were reported among the Syrians, who came under Israeli fire for the first time since being forced out of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> invasion of June 1982. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 16,000 soldiers in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>. `` We have taken all the necessary measures and precautions to avoid friction with Syrian forces,'' Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, the army deputy spokesman, told reporters in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Troops flashed victory signs as they rolled back into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in armored vehicles and tanks covered in dust. At a border checkpoint in the Israeli town of <LOCATION> Metulla </LOCATION>, soldiers were offered candy and cold drinks. `` I could n't care less about the sweets, I just want to go home,'' one shouted. Another trooper sat glumly on an armored personnel carrier, holding the helmet of a dead comrade. A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said unexpected resistance from the Lebanese Shiite militiamen altered the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan for a quick operation, which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials expected would last only 24 hours. `` The original plan changed with the clashes occurred,'' said the source. Security sources said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> added two mechanized battalions to its operation Tuesday night, doubling to 2,500 troops the size of the force that began the thrust the night before. Invading soldiers penetrated several miles beyond the `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has maintained just north of its border since ending a three-year occupation of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985. The zone ranges from 6 to 10 miles deep. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> earlier Wednesday the soldiers met resistance and might continue the operation for two more days. A statement from the military command said most of the guerrillas killed belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Shiite Moslem group loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The operation was conducted `` in the framework of the ongoing defense policy and with the aim of hitting terrorists ... recently deployed in the security zone and on its outskirts,'' the statement said. Lebanese police said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops stormed <PERSON> Maydoun </PERSON> village in the western sector of the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> on Wednesday after 11 hours of street battles with <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militiamen. They blew up several houses and retreated just before sundown, the police said. Shiite factions said eight militiamen were killed and 20 wounded. According to the Israeli army, guerrillas expelled all residents of <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> last year and `` built fortifications and trenches, turning the village into a fortified outpost of the Shiite terrorist group.'' At <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, the Syrians took cover in sandbag positions and foxholes during six hours of shelling by 155mm howitzers. <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> is five miles north of <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION>. Syrian troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> were put on maximum alert when helicopters landed Israeli soldiers before dawn Tuesday near their lines in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> foothills. The hills around <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> and nearby <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Tineh are traditional strongholds of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, whose name means Party of God. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, who claimed responsibility for several raids into the security zone in the past two years, were overwhelmed by the Israeli onslaught. A spokesman said five fighters were killed and 16 wounded trying to stop the Israeli advance. Wednesday's thrust took Israeli forces 9 miles west of five villages they entered Tuesday in search for Palestinian guerrillas and allied leftist militiamen. At noon Wednesday, the Israelis withdrew from the villages of <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Memis </PERSON>, Kfeer, <PERSON> Khalwat </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> after `` completing the search,'' the police spokesman said. Ain Ata Mayor <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Qadi </PERSON>, 70, said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officer told him: `` Do not allow saboteurs into your village and we'll not come again.'' `` I told him the guerrillas do not ask our permission to attack <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Qadi </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee OKs $100 Million For Super Collider</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday recommended spending $ 100 million next year on the proposed superconducting super collider research project. The amount approved by the energy subcommittee was $ 40 million more than it had originally recommended, but was less than one-third the $ 363 million asked by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` This is the first hurdle for funding,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON>, R-Mich., the only subcommittee member whose state is a candidate for the project `` To survive, it is important that the project receive adequate support at this stage.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee, said the legislation limits spending to research and development leading to the $ 4.4 billion physics research project, which will include a 53-mile-round particle accelerator `` We feel like the $ 100 million is adequate to hold the team together, the scientists, and also to go ahead with the necessary reserch and all the preliminaries ... getting ready for construction,'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said. But he added that `` this money is not to be used for purchsing equipment or starting construction.'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said the subcommittee increased its recommendation with the backing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic and Republican leadership. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has recommended $ 200 million for the super collider and other high-energy and nuclear-physics projects but has not recommended an appropriations amount. <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said he and other subcommittee members would support legislation authorizing the super collider project, `` but I think every one of the panel feels as I do that we've got to have some extra revenue before we commit this government to a project that is going to cost somewhere between $ 5.3 billion and $ 9 billion.'' The $ 5.3 billion estimate includes anticipated inflation. The $ 9 million estimate was produced by <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>'s staff. The super collider would fire subatomic particles against each other at high speeds for research into the nature of matter. Seven states _ <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ have been selected as potential sites for the project, which is expected to create 4,000 permanent jobs and have an annual budget of $ 280 million. Supporters argue that the super collider is needed to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> competitive in the next century. Opponents say the project would siphon much-needed money from other scientific research. Meanwhile, a group of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> business, education and labor leaders presented the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with a plan to pay for the super collider without immediate outlays by the federal government. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Macpherson </PERSON>, assistant attorney general and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s super collider coordinator, and <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan would create a state agency to issue bonds for construction of the project, which would be leased to the federal government.

<HEAD>Improvement Widespread Throughout US Economy, Fed Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has enjoyed healthy growth so far this year, with even such depressed sectors as energy and farming showing improvement, according to an economic assessment released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The central bank said `` continued moderate growth of the nation's economy'' was confirmed by the reports received from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 regional banks. Economists at the regional banks survey economic conditions in their districts and the reports are compiled for use by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers when they meet every eight weeks to review monetary policy. The next meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will be on May 17. The government reported last week that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at an annual rate of 2.3 percent from January through March. It was a far better performance than the recession that many analysts had feared immediately following the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. This better-than-expected growth has led to expectations that the central bank may soon begin tightening up on credit conditions and boosting interest rates as a way of fighting inflationary pressures. Such an action would seem to be consistent with the generally upbeat economic assessments contained in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday. The report said manufacturing activity remained strong, primarily because of strong growth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. It said housing activity has shown some improvement following the slump at the end of last year caused by high interst rates and consumer jitters caused by the stock market collapse. The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> bank, which covers <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and part of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, reported that textile mills in the region were running at near capacity, in part because of rising export sales. Several regional banks in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> reported a pickup in oil drilling activity. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> region said oil-drilling had rebounded sharply with the number of rigs in use growing for the first time in six months. In agriculture, the report said farm incomes were expected to be high this year, but down slightly from the 1987 level because of smaller government payments and smaller profits in the livestock sector. `` Farmland values are generally rising in most areas and farm financial conditions appear to be strengthening,'' the report said. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank found that the number of farmers and ranchers leaving agriculture had slowed considerably, while the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> districts predicted that cotton acreage should be up substantially this year.

 How can anyone resist a bite of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutkin </PERSON>'s spinach rolls when he is deliberately pulling them apart in front of passers-by, letting the hot mozzarella ooze out? And who would walk by meatballs bubbling in sauce, or a pizza laden with pepperoni, when samples are there for the taking? The public does n't get to walk through this particular valley of temptation: The two-day Taste Show at the Convention Hall is designed for potential customers from the food service and retail food industries. But for the lucky convention-goers, it was a golden opportunity to try <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zitin </PERSON>'s honey ham, or maybe <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnurman </PERSON>'s mango nectar. They could chew on rope cheese, nibble at the chocolate cake, sample some shrimp or munch some macaroni salad. But above all _ Eat! Eat! Eat! That's what this convention is all about. There were 200 representatives of food product manufacturers on hand. `` This show is a glutton's fantasy,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Villari </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tri-State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy-Deli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the show's sponsor On Tuesday, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> handed out paper-thin slices of soppressata, a spicy luncheon meat made by a company in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Across the aisle, <PERSON> Zitin </PERSON> was promoting `` Made In the U.S.A.'' honey ham that he says has only 25 calories per serving. `` Ham has a bad reputation because people perceive it as fatty,'' he said. `` We have a hard time showing it off _ it's just a big wrapped loaf in the deli cooler.'' If <PERSON> Zitin </PERSON> thought he had a hard time marketing his meat, consider <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Groezinger </PERSON>, who was pushing `` headcheese'' made of pork tongues and pork snouts. `` People love it _ really,'' he said. The battle of the pizzas at The Taste Show was intense. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheaffer </PERSON> said his family company is the `` largest manufacturer of crusts in the country.'' But <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hips </PERSON> touted his `` gourmet pizza'' as fresh, not frozen. Unlike frozen pies, the melted mozzarella cheese pulls away from the crust when bitten into. `` This is wall-to-wall cheese,'' <PERSON> Hips </PERSON> said proudly. `` Women want fresh, you know?'' <PERSON> Schnurman </PERSON>, meanwhile, had a catalog with more than 2,000 products ranging from pita crisps to preserves to spicy sauces for ribs. He was attracting a variety of nibblers to his table. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Loperfido </PERSON>, on the other hand, was attracting some skeptics. People peered at his `` Sea Legs'' selection _ processed fish formed to look like shrimp and lobster tails. `` We sell these everywhere, from four-star restaurants to mom-and-pop delis to the local prison,'' he said. `` Why should people have to deal with shells and other inconsistencies in real shellfish?'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> had no problems with promoting his product, as eager tasters lined up for <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s ice cream. Business is so great, he said, that `` we're not going into new markets right now, but just trying to consolidate business in the states we're now in.'' Conventions in this seaside resort normally hand out tote bags with freebies _ key chains, rulers and posters. But at The Taste Show, no shopping bags are allowed. Only stomachs are allowed to leave full.

<TEXT>
 The top court of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> gave the go-ahead Wednesday to a four-year, scientific-theological inquiry into homosexuality. The nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the study is intended to provide `` a base of information to assist the church in resolving the difference of opinion within the church regarding the interpretation of homosexuality in the context of the Christian gospel.'' The go-ahead to the homosexual study, one of the most extensive ever undertaken by a church, came after its legality was questioned under a church rule barring funds to gay groups or `` to promote acceptance of homosexuality.'' The church court held that providing for the study clearly was `` not in conflict'' with the proscription. No estimate was given of the cost of the study authorized at the church's governing conference, held every four years. Earlier in the conference, the 9.6-million-member denomination strongly reaffirmed a ban on active homosexuals in the clergy and condemned such activity. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Wall of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a Methodist and editor of the ecumenical weekly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION>, said that undertaking the study `` leaves our position under a question mark.'' `` The simple fact that the study is being made says there may be something that was missed by the delegates'' in their actions, he said. In authorizing the study, the conference said `` homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling to conscientious Christians of differing opinions,'' with biblical, theological and scientific questions about it in dispute. To try to get the answers, the church directed a study enlisting the `` best biological, psychological and sociological information,'' as well as theological and ethical analysis. Scientists and other experts from outside the denomination will be consulted. The conference, attended by nearly 1,000 delegates, also called for a moratorium on the patenting of animals produced by genetic engineering and authorized a major study of the ethical and other implications of such technology. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leader who addressed the conference said Christianity is growing rapidly in his country and voiced hope for reconciliation between Chinese Catholics and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` I would say I hope very much and pray very much for normalization between the Chinese church and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and for reconciliation between the two sides,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ting </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. Chinese Catholicism broke ties with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> after Communism came to power and functions independently as the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> has made numerous recent moves for reconciliation without avail. <PERSON> Ting </PERSON> said there are 8 million Christians in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, about 4 million Protestants and 4 million Catholics. He said Protestants are increasing twice as fast as the population. However, he discounted Western evangelical reports of 50 to 70 million Chinese Christians. `` Conversion to the Christian faith is not not that easy,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee said Wednesday it had referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for criminal investigation a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official's testimony about his lobbying contacts on a $ 130 million pontoon contract for scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Testimony of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for shipbuilding, about his reasons for agreeing to set aside the pontoon contract for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> `` contains serious inconsistencies and contradicts relevant documents warranting further investigation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight of government management concluded in a report on <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and its involvement with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>'s testimony before the subcommittee last year was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last December and has been under review, said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee aides, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>, who was instrumental in awarding the pontoon contract to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, denied at the hearings that he spoke to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> before the contract was awarded in April 1984. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, convicted earlier this year of illegal lobbying on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and other clients, was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director until January 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee's report said the evidence includes statements by former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and a calendar of <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>'s secretary showing that <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> met at least three times with <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> in September and October 1983. The calendar also shows <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> accepted an invitation to an anniversary celebration of the Nofziger-Bragg firm on Feb. 2, 1984. <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> also `` failed to disclose the full scope'' of his relationship with <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight of government management. It was n't until after last year's hearings that <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> supplied the subcommittee with office calendars indicating that he spoke to <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> on the phone `` on at least 60 other occasions in 1984, 1985 and 1986.'' The post-hearing documents supplied by <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> showed he had a breakfast and two other meetings with <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> in 1983; seven meetings with <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985; at least two lunches with <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> in 1985 and 1986; and that he attended three anniversary celebrations of <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>'s lobbying firm. <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> supplied the information after testifying that he last talked to <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> about <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in early 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials have said <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> claimed to have discussed the pontoon contract extensively with <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> in this period. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said in a statement that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general found <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> had violated department ethics policy and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations when he attended the events A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>'s office stands on the testimony that the assistant secretary gave earlier to <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s subcommittee and that he would not comment further. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and two other men are under indictment for racketeering charges for allegedly extracting payments from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in a scheme to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials.

 After spending more than $ 2,000 and eight years seeking help from attorneys, illegal immigrants <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Beatriz </PERSON> <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> took their six children and applied for amnesty on their own Wednesday, the last day of the program. They said they gave up on one lawyer last week after it took him a year to tell them their papers were no good. `` He wanted to charge us $ 1,750 more to arrange the amnesty,'' said <PERSON> Casares </PERSON>, who says he has lived in <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION> with his wife since 1979. They borrowed the $ 420 family application fee from relatives in time to spend Tuesday night and early Wednesday wrapped in blankets outside the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s legalization center here. The couple and their children were among about 1,000 people in line when the center serving the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> opened Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> legally from <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with a border crossing card in 1979 and never returned, her husband said. <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> said he swam the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, a river that forms the border between <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. They have worked various construction, yard mowing and migrant farm labor jobs since then. Mrs. <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> said many employers paid them in cash because they did not have Social Security numbers, but whenever they were given a check, she saved receipts. She also held on to rent receipts from the four-room house they have rented for eight years. `` I thought we might need them someday,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> said. All the while, they put their faith in people representing themselves as immigration attorneys, in an effort to become legal residents. Most of the more than $ 2,000 they spent on the lawyers was for `` identification letters'' they would have to renew monthly, usually for $ 40, they said. Such letters have little value, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, chief legalization officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Harlingen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> center. `` All that is is a letter saying they are clients of an attorney and that the authorities have to call the attorney before deporting them,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, adding he has heard of similar fraud schemes throughout his 33-year career with the agency. `` There are lawyers who thrive on that,'' he said. Or, the `` attorneys'' may have been notaries public who prey on Mexicans who think the title means the same as `` notario publico,'' a term for lawyer in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Casares </PERSON>, 42, said the first attorney took $ 1,600 of their money over seven years then told them he could not do anything for them. The second man took $ 600 in a year before the <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> family decided a week ago they were wasting their money and their quickly expiring time. They said they would use their rent receipts, check stubs and other papers to show they have lived in this country since before Jan. 1, 1982, as called for in the 1986 amnesty law. On Wednesday, the couple and their older children born in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> received slips of paper telling them to report to the center Nov. 3 for legalization interviews. Mrs. <PERSON> Casares </PERSON> said she is confident their applications will be accepted and that their landlady will vouch for them if necessary.

<HEAD>Crack Raid Involves 100 Police Officers Taking Over One Block</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 100 police officers, their guns drawn, briefly took over a one-block area of a residential neighborhood intending to wrest control of a cluster of suspected `` crack'' houses. `` A lot of people were dealing out of multiple locations,'' Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Laux </PERSON> said after Tuesday night's raid. `` They are taking over a block and saying, ` This is our block.' We're saying ... it's a block and we're going to take the block back.'' Seven persons were arrested in the raids on seven suspected drug houses, which police said was the department's largest single police criminal action in recent memory. There was no shooting during the raid. One man faces possible felony charges was carrying 13 doses of crack, $ 600 and a handgun when police broke into one of the suspected crack houses, <PERSON> Laux </PERSON> said. The sweep only turned up two other small amounts of the drug and one shotgun, <PERSON> Laux </PERSON> said. If any charges are filed against the remaining suspects, they would be misdemeanor charges, <PERSON> Laux </PERSON> said. `` In that respect it was disappointing,'' <PERSON> Laux </PERSON> said. `` It certainly is nicer if somebody is there holding a large amount -LRB- of drugs. -RRB- But the message still goes out to the neighborhood that we will not let them take over city blocks and ply their illegal trade.'' The raids were prompted, in part, by hundreds of calls from residents to police and to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> <PERSON> Belton </PERSON>, who accompanied officers on the operation. `` The calls have been coming in every day of the week, whenever you're in the office,'' she said. `` People are frustrated that the narcotics unit ca n't come immediately. But concrete information has to be pulled together first. People do n't understand that. They see it at all hours on the street.'' In fact, police said, most of the houses raided by special assault teams Tuesday had been raided at least once in the past few months. In addition to making undercover purchases in the crack houses in recent weeks, surveillance officers witnessed drug deals taking place in front of several of the houses, said Sgt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who organized the entry teams. Neighbors said drug dealing has been prevalent not only on their block, but on surrounding blocks as well. `` You can bust'em, and bust'em and bust'em, but that does n't mean they're going to go away,'' said a man drinking beer on his steps next to one of the houses that was raided `` This has been going on for months. It's gotten real bad. There's little kids here and everything.''

<TEXT>
 Ignoring a veto threat, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday for a deep reduction in spending for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' anti-missile defense program After a long series of votes, the Democratic-controlled chamber ended up approving $ 3.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known. The decisions came as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> worked on a huge bill authorizing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, compared with the current $ 3.9 billion budgeted for the five-year-old program. The Star Wars budget was approved Wednesday on a 223-195 vote, after three earlier votes which rejected both total elimination of all Star Wars money and granting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his entire request, along with another proposal to provide $ 4.1 billion. First, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 312-105 to reject an amendment that would have granted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s entire $ 4.8 billion request. Then it turned down, 299-118, another proposal to eliminate the entire SDI budget. After that, a 227-190 voted turned back the $ 4.1 billion budget recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Later, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 244-174 to limit spending on the so-called `` phase one'' of SDI to 40 percent of the total Star Wars budget. `` Phase one'' is aimed at developing an early version of the missile defense and current plans called for raising the level of `` Phase One'' spending within the SDI program from 40 percent to 50 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the $ 3.5 billion SDI figure in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill is n't enough and warned that he will recommend a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto unless Star Wars spending is increased. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sends the president a defense bill that contains a funding level for SDI that is in my view inadequate, I would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in a letter read during the debate. The votes were part of the complicated congressional budget process and the $ 3.5 billion spending level means the final congressional SDI figure is likely to be around $ 4.1 billion. That's because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill that will be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> starting next week proposes $ 4.6 billion for Star Wars. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s SDI program traditionally has fared better in the more conservative <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, even though that chamber also is controlled by Democrats. Differences between the two bills, including the SDI budget, will eventually be reconciled by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes $ 4.6 billion and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> figure remains at $ 3.5 billion, the likely compromise will be around $ 4.0 billion, said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> During four hours of debate, SDI critics and supporters repeated their past statements. Critics contended the program wo n't work because it is technologically unfeasible, while supporters argued that SDI scientists have made a number of breakthroughs and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advances worry the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., called Star Wars `` an astrological dream our president decided to pursue,'' a reference to reports that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, follow astrology But Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said, `` The debate no longer is whether we ought to have an SDI ... the experts on both sides all support it.'' Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., said `` It makes no sense to spend billions on long-shot futuristic dreams'' when the budgets for non-nuclear weapons such as tanks and planes are being reduced Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said SDI is full of `` half-baked proposals'' and he urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to `` prevent a rush to deploy inadequate and destabilizing weapons in space. For Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., the House was being `` reckless, counterproductive'' to reduce the SDI budget below the current figure Rep. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, R-Calif., urged increases in SDI spending because he said, `` We're asking a question with this research and ... we have to devote resources to answer this question.

<TEXT>
 Little <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, a toddler found wandering in traffic almost six weeks ago, has been identified, police said Wednesday. But the boy's father, who came forward last week after hearing news accounts of the child's odyssey, has dropped out of sight again now that police have discovered warrants against him. The 20-month-old boy is <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the son of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION>, said Detective <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` The father gave me a lot of information that matched with what I had,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Police decided late Tuesday that <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>'s information was accurate after checking birth records and footprints The thin, fair-haired boy with brown eyes had been unidentified since he was found in the street, dirty and hungry. Police said he may have been wandering for two days. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, 21, told police when he first contacted them Friday that his wife and <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> left with a man named <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> in August while <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> was in jail on spouse abuse and bad check charges. After <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> gave police <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s birth certificate, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> compared <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s footprints with birth records on file at the hospital. The records show that <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> was born on Aug. 19, 1986. Shortly after the boy was found, a drunken man reported to police he had lost `` little <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>,'' and told a hard-to-follow story about being given the boy at a skid-row bar. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, in the company of a woman named <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, according to the report, left the child in a <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> bar and went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state on a borrowed motorcycle. Police say the owner of the motorcycle has since filed a report on the bike because it has not been returned. <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> police say there is no new information in their effort to locate the child's mother or <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>. `` I'd be interested in speaking to the mother,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, but added there have been no charges filed against her. <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies tried on Monday and Tuesday to arrest <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> on outstanding warrants related to driving while intoxicated and failure to complete more than 30 days in jail. Deputies have been unable to contact him at home. He works out of town as a carpenter, they said. A woman who showed up in <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION> on Thursday asking for custody, claiming to be the child's maternal grandmother, was arrested Friday in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state grand theft and fraud charges involving about $ 110,000 in cash and merchandise. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a child protection supervisor for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION>, said she ca n't say how the arrests will affect the child's future Besides <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, his parents and his mother-in-law, a maternal aunt in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have asked for custody. Home studies will be made to consider all custody requests by relatives, Ms. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. The boy continues to live with a family licensed by the state agency as an emergency shelter.

 Sandinista police thwarted an anti-government rally by rounding up more than 25 opposition leaders Wednesday, and the leftist government restricted the news operations of several radio stations. Radio Corporacion was closed for 24 hours while <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> were barred from regular news programming for eight days. The government said they had been broadcasting `` false news'' related to a strike. The actions came on the ninth day of a hunger strike by about 30 construction workers and auto mechanics who are demanding higher pay. Union officials said 4,500 workers remained off the job Wednesday, more than two months after their strike began. <PERSON> Lorena </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said police in military and civilian vehicles picked up 25 members of 14 opposition political parties, ranging from the rightist Social Christians to the Communists. They had gathered at the Social Democrats' office and were preparing to leave for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> building about a mile away, where the hunger strikers were holed up. The opposition leaders had planned to hold a rally at about noon, but it did not take place. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, later said the group `` was invited'' to meet with Cmdr. <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tijerino </PERSON>, head of the Sandinista police, and taken by bus to meet the commander. She did not elaborate. Police also detained two opposition leaders _ <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadamuz </PERSON>, both of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ as they arrived at the Workers Federation headquarters. `` This is the repressive customs of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Front,'' <PERSON> Guadamuz </PERSON> said before the police led him away. `` They are violent by tradition.'' More than 40 people have been taken into police custody in connection with the hunger strike since it began April 25. Police cordoned off the front of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> building and officers ringed the area. Reinforcements waited in military trucks. The protesting workers stood behind locked gates. At one point, the police pushed several journalists and demanded they move to another area. Under an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> order issued late Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporacion </ORGANIZATION> was shut down immediately and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station, had their news broadcasts restricted. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osejo </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporacion </ORGANIZATION>, was punched in the mouth by Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> last week because the station broadcast what <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said was incorrect information about the fast, according to Barricada, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> had been shut down for almost two years for failing to broadcast the president's end-of-year message in 1985. The only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, was shuttered on June 26, 1986, for 15 months. Press restrictions were common under a state of emergency enacted by the government in March 1982, four months after the war began with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> lifted those restrictions in January to comply with a regional peace plan signed in August by five Central American presidents. The Workers Federation, a coalition of socialist unions, said 4,500 construction workers and car mechanics went on strike Feb. 25 to demand higher salaries and better working conditions. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> has said only 400 workers are on strike. The interior minister, during an interview late Tuesday, said the strike was `` political and exaggerated.'' He defended the police actions, saying: `` Our police are absolutely anti-repression. They never are abusive, or use torture or murder.''

<HEAD>Phosphoric Acid Spill Kills Thousands Of Fish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBSONTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spill of 28,000 gallons of acid into a Gulf Coast shipping channel has killed thousands of fish and left environmental officials threatening to shut the plant responsible. The phosphoric acid that spilled into the 30-foot-deep mouth of the <LOCATION> Alafia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was a 54 percent concentration, according to <ORGANIZATION> Gardinier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which reported the spill soon after it occurred Sunday. `` That's real strong. It would burn you badly,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> director. <PERSON> Gardinier </PERSON>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> that makes fertilizer from the acid, reported the spill from a storage tank Sunday by leaving a message on the commission's telephone answering machine. `` The company said there's nothing wrong,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. But Tuesday, thousands of fish and other wildlife, including blue crabs, flounder and ray, were floating dead on the water. `` The time has come for that plant to shut down. I've got an attorney working on that,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials were en route to the scene from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said experts had not decided whether to let the acid dissolve or churn up the brackish, 3,000-foot-wide mouth of the river to dilute the acid with seawater. The acid overflowed Sunday from one of <PERSON> Gardinier </PERSON>'s 5,500-ton tanks, said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the plant's vice president for industrial relations. Company engineers estimated 200 tons of the acid spilled into the river, he said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said a plant operator was trying to pump the liquid from a tank to another area where it would be mixed with phosphate rock. Instead, an open valve that the operator thought was closed allowed the liquid to flow into another tank, causing it to spill over, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Company officials at first thought the acid was trapped in a retention pond around the tank, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Residents fishing near the plant Monday and Tuesday said they noticed milky-colored water and dead fish and crabs in the river and called the commission. The county recently cited <PERSON> Gardinier </PERSON> after a cloud of sulfur dioxide and ammonia sickened residents and diners in a restaurant across the river April 7. The company, which was cited for not notifying the county, blamed the leak on an improperly programmed computer that opens and closes valves. After heavy rains in 1987, storm-water retention ponds overflowed and <PERSON> Gardinier </PERSON> dumped 13.7 million gallons of acidic waste into <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The spill resulted in a massive fish kill, and the state fined <PERSON> Gardinier </PERSON> $ 200,000.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that it will stop allowing its employees to buy junk bonds the firm underwrites, a practice that had been criticized as unfair and possibly illegal. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> informed Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., by telephone that the firm was stopping purchases of new issues by so-called `` insider accounts,'' which had been the focus of congressional hearings last week, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s spokesman <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which was instrumental in developing the market for high-yield, high-risk `` junk'' bonds, had allowed employees and partnerships formed by employees to buy bonds from hot new issues even though that sometimes denied public customers the opportunity to buy all of the bonds they wanted. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had raised questions about the legality of the trading and its fairness to the customers. Employees, according to the committee, were able to make substantial profits by purchasing newly issued bonds from the firm and holding them for several weeks or months and then reselling them. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, in 6 -LCB- hours of hearings last Thursday, defended the practice as perfectly proper, saying bond prices were not as subject to manipulation in the same way as stock prices. But he had acknowledged that he was troubled by the appearance of a conflict. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the firm was barring employees and employee partnerships from buying new public issues of debt securities `` to avoid any appearance of possible unfairness.'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> praised the decision as `` a very good step,'' adding in a statement, `` It should lay to rest questions associated with the fairness and legality of that particular practice. ... <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s decision is both good from the standpoint of the public interest and wise.

 Shipping executives said Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British warships were investigating reports of Iranian vessels sowing mines off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, but there was no confirmation any were found.

The executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pilot described one ship as a `` landing craft'' and the other as resembling a frigate, but could identify neither.

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has asked the world to help it repair the damage of war and resettle millions of refugees. Neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where most of the refugees live, called the request a propaganda tactic. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> armed and supported Moslem rebels who have fought Soviet-supported governments since a Communist coup in April 1978. The Kremlin has had military forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since December 1979, but has agreed to withdraw its estimated 115,000 soldiers in nine months beginning May 15. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will support aid for the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the proper time but this is not the appropriate time, while Soviet troops have not started to withdraw,'' <PERSON> Mansoor </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhail </PERSON>, press spokesman for the Pakistani <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission, said Wednesday. He called the Afghan request `` a propaganda tactic to seek legitimacy of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime which was installed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ... a regime which is not acceptable to the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' More than 5 million Afghans, about one-third of the population, have fled their country since the civil war began. At least 3 million live in border camps and cities in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dost </PERSON>, asked the Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for urgent consideration of the request for assistance after the Soviets leave, but did not name a figure. The council, which held its first meeting of 1988 on Tuesday, will consider next week whether to put the question on its agenda. <PERSON> Dost </PERSON> said in a letter to the secretary-general and council that the withdrawal agreement, mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, paved the way for normalizing the situation in and around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` This enables the government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to embark upon a huge reconstruction effort to undo the enormous damage inflicted by the war and to resettle the Afghan refugees returning to their country,'' he said. `` Such an effort is beyond the domestic means available to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and requires the assistance of this world body.'' The 18-member Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> makes recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which has voted overwhelmingly every year for withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Astronomers Find Lightest Weight Star Yet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A star that may be the least massive ever found has been located by three <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> astrophysicists at a point 3,000 light years across the Milky Way. The star was discovered when it repeatedly eclipsed a heavier, rapidly spinning companion pulsar star, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. Discoverers of the pair of stars were <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fruchter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinebring </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, all of the physics department at <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>. The astronomers said the dwarf star interrupts or eclipses the radio signals from the pulsar star at regular intervals as the two stars circle each other every nine hours and 10 minutes. Measurements of this interval helped determine the size of the two stars. `` The dwarf star is possibly the smallest star ever seen,'' <PERSON> Stinebring </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> announcement. `` It's also unlike typical stars in that it does not shine by its own nuclear reactions. Nor is it anything like a planet.'' He said the pulsar star, which is much heavier though smaller in circumference than the dwarf star, is spinning at the rate of 622 times per second. This is the second-fastest spin of the 440 known pulsars. The fastest rotates at 642 times per second. Pulsars are small, dense stars thought to be remnants of exploded stars, or supernovas. Pulsars emit radio signals that are pulsed by their rotation. The pair of unusual stars was discovered using the world's most powerful radio telescope at the <ORGANIZATION> Arecibo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The pulsar was first seen March 3 by <PERSON> Fruchter </PERSON>. Two weeks later, the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> team discovered that the pulsar signal was interrupted for 50 minutes during each pulsar orbit. By carefully measuring the eclipse, the team discovered that the dwarf star is about 50 percent larger in circumference than the sun, but has only about 2 per cent of the sun's mass. <PERSON> Stinebring </PERSON> said this means that the dwarf star is only 25 times more massive than Jupiter, the largest of the sun's planets.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Wednesday met with advisers, liberal activists and congrssional Democrats as he vowed to continue his campaign for the presidential nomination despite his fading delegate count. Turning his attention to the West and the delegate-rich <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest on June 7, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> held meetings with a group of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members from western states and with some 50 or 60 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, with his advisers and with a group of representatives from liberal organizations. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave `` pep talks'' and heard reports about what's going on with various interest groups, including consumer and peace organizations, as he headed down the home stretch of the primary campaign. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said there is no intention to `` work any less'' in the face of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' widening lead. He said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp sees no reason to ease up on criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the interest of party unity, and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters will be ready to make their wishes known at the convention. `` There's no marriage unless we get to the wedding,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s heavy losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and his runaway victory in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> left the delegate count at 927 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to 1,500 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The seven states remaining on the primary calendar hold 577 delegates, including 314 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and 109 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Wednesday that he apparently made a mistake in saying that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received about $ 46,000 in consulting wages from entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> last year. `` That was my mistake. They have not paid him any money. They -LRB- <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, through his production company -RRB- have paid money to Personalities International. I do n't know the details of that,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Personalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company headed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s wife, received payments for his other speaking engagements and publications The company paid <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> $ 159,000 as an employee and consultant last year, according to the tax forms. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he did not know how much <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s production company gave the firm or what the payment was for, and said any details would have to come in writing from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> or his accounting firm, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKeever </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> nor the accounting firm immediately returned messages left at their <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> offices Wednesday evening. The discrepancy arose when <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, through a spokesman, disputed <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' explanation Tuesday of the $ 46,535 business services income reported on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1987 tax return. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said then it was mainly consulting fees paid by <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has made a point of stressing party unity, said at a news conference that he is not happy with the delegate-selection process in some states, but did not specifically say he would challenge it. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads him by only 8 percentage points in the popular vote, and that margin should be reflected in the voting by super delegates _ those delegates selected by virtue of holding important party positions or public office. `` The super delegates will do <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a super favor by not interfering in the process. ... I simply want fairness,'' he said. The super delegate system allows those delegates to back the candidate of their choosing, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said they should follow the popular vote, suggesting they should not try to settle the nomination before the primary season is over. `` We're within striking distance,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It's not over really till it's over.'' `` The party machinery is saying, in fact, go for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The pundits are saying go for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In some sense, the super delegates are moving in that direction and so against the party, the pundits, the press. We press on against those odds,'' he said. `` We're not about to turn back.'' The Democratic Caucus chairman, former presidential candidate Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, said `` everyone admires the grace and tone'' with which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has conducted his campaign, and characterized the morning meeting as ` ` warm and successful. In his meeting with 13 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who are part of a `` Go West'88'' group, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> discussed issues of concern to western states. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., an organizer of the group, said they talked about trade, drugs, immigration and energy `` He made it clear trade expansion was something very important on his agenda,'' said <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, who told reporters the sessiom was `` a very positive kind of discussion.''

 Three thunderous explosions destroyed a space shuttle fuel plnt and a candy factory Wednesday, generating a five-square-mile toxic cloud, injuring more than 150 people and leaving others unaccounted for, authorities said. Because of toxic smoke and flames, it was not immediately known whether all the workers at the plants escaped. Authorities initially said one person had died, and there were unconfirmed reports nine people had died, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cool </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> manager. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> later said there were no confirmed deaths, although two people were missing. Flames and orange smoke rose into the sky, and buildings shook 10 miles away in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> after the midday explosions at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>. `` It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground and windows in the whole town shattered,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, 37, of <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, who was getting gasoline when the blasts occurred. `` We have tried to count noses. We're uncertain whether we've accounted for everyone What we see is pretty much total devastation,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> spokesman. All roads to <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a town of 54,590 people midway between <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hoover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, were closed. Residents were told to keep windows closed against the toxic cloud. Two of the blasts, which leveled the fuel plant and the <ORGANIZATION> Kidd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> marshmallow factory next door, registered on earthquake seismographs 200 miles away at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>. The first blast, at 11:53 a.m., measured about 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion; the second at 11:57 a.m. had a magnitude of 3.5. `` I find that absolutely amazing. That is extremely powerful,'' said <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>. The fuel plant manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the accident was not expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights. The explosions followed a fire that began when `` one of our pieces of equipment malfunctioned,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` The fire spread quickly and there was an explosion.'' At least two blasts followed shortly. More than 150 people were injured at the plants and in surrounding neighborhoods, according to tallies from hospitals. Most had cuts and bruises from flying glass and debris. Others suffered burns, broken bones or shock. Firefighters were unable to enter the site for nearly three hours after the explosions because of the threat of additional blasts and the toxic cloud. Two hundred people were believed to be at the fuel plant at the time of the blasts, said <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>. The candy plant employed 85 people, but few employees of either plant had been seen at hospitals, authorities said. `` There are people out there who are probably dying,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Mercy Ambulance in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, which sent ambulances to the site. `` People are out there on the desert wandering aimlessly'' if they escaped, she said. The toxic cloud, five miles square and moving to the northeast, contained hydrochloric acid and `` it is very important that no one be within five miles of the smoke or fire,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` The strategy is to let it -LRB- the plant fire -RRB- burn.'' Hospitals reported treating at least 154 people, and at least four were in critical condition. More than 70 residents of the <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, two miles from the blast, were evacuated to the <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, after the explosion damaged their building, officials said. Emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke billowed across the entire <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. All area schools were evacuated, and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Services </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> appealed for emergency contributions. `` Our windows blew out. It blew the frame off the door. We are probably five or six miles away,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Henderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convalescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> provides the ammonium perchlorate to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s prime contractor for the motors, as well as to some <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> programs. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Amitor </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Morton-Thiokol </PERSON> had enough ammonium perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is one of two companies that supply ammonium perchlorate for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> solid fuel rocket engines, including the space shuttle, Minuteman and Titan projects. The other is <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION>, also near <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> received no <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> contracts in fiscal 1988, although they had two in 1987, totaling $ 675,000. `` Currently, we have no information that <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> work is in any way related to the fire,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statment. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Ligonier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, expanded to the Gibson Business Park and opened its 36,500-square-foot plant about two years ago.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to go along Wednesday with a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan to negotiate with a private firm for lease on a space factory that would be put in orbit by the space shuttle and serviced periodically by astronauts. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> space science subcommittee, in an action approved by a voice vote, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> may call for bids on a so-called Commercially Developed Space Facility, but that it can not award contracts without the express permission of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The committee's instructions are part of a bill that would authorize $ 11.5 billion to be spent by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It requires <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to submit the results of its request for proposals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the next presidential budget message next January or February. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new space policy, announced in February, included `` an intent for the federal government to lease space as an anchor tenant in an orbiting space facility ... that is financed, constructed and operated by the private sector.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which had strongly opposed such a facility until that time, came to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and said it would lease 70 percent of the factory for five years at $ 140 million a year. The agency declared its intent to issue requests for proposals within two months, saying the facility was needed to bridge the time span until a space station is in orbit in the mid-1990s. A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> firm, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has designed such a robot space factory, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee specified that proposals must be submitted by more than one company. Some critics see any government agreement for the Commercially Developed Space Facility as usurping funds and thus killing the space station, and the space subcommittee specified in its bill that the money for the facility must not come out of funds for other projects. Last Friday, four influential members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> saying they will not permit <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to enter into a lease in the next fiscal year and that they object to even a request for a proposal. Their argument _ that the idea had not been studied sufficiently and its need had not been established _ was carried on in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing. The subcommittee, however, voted 18-8 against a proposal that would have shelved the idea completely until next year.

<TEXT>
 Roman Catholic leaders are trying to negotiate an end to a hunger strike by at least 5,000 workers and students before Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> arrives next Monday on his first visit to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. The hunger strikers, who began their fast last week, oppose government economic programs and demand higher wages. Hundreds of students and workers have marched through the streets of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> almost daily in anti-government protests. Interior Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> said extreme leftist groups organized the hunger strike and the protest marches to create `` a climate of social unrest that will show a distorted image of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> when the pope arrives.'' On Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s five-day visit here next week, he will travel from the 13,000-foot-high city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> to the lowlands and will meet miners, farmers, and Indians as well as church and government officials. Church officials here are also trying to soft-pedal a letter sent by a group of Bolivian priests to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> last month protesting the appointment of foreign bishops. `` It seems strange to us that after nearly half a century of evangelization in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we must still import the ecclesiastical hierarchy to teach, santify and rule Christians in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>,'' said the letter. The protests originated after three foreign bishops were named in April to run dioceses in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. According to figures released by the church, 634 of the 834 priests working in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are foreigners, as are 17 of the 29 bishops. Church officials have been meeting with leaders of the Bolivian Workers Central trying to resolve the hunger strike. The Workers Central represents most workers in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Its secretary-general, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, says, `` The situation of hunger and misery can no longer be supported and for this reason the protests will continue until our demands are met. We can not hide the dramatic reality, economic and social reality, from the eyes of the pope.'' The Workers Central demands a wage increase higher than the 10 to 20 percent given by the government last month. With the increase the minimum monthly wage is $ 35. The Workers Central says a worker needs 10 times that amount to subsist. The Workers Central also demands bigger budgets for health and education. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Abril </PERSON> y Castello, said `` the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sees with great preoccupation how the social situation in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> could tarnish the visit of the Holy Father.''

 When the explosions at a fuel plant jolted nearby casinos Wednesday, some gamblers packing roulette and card tables rushed to cash in their chips before evacuating, officials said. After the first blast, `` people still played, they did n't want to leave, but after the second blast, everybody took it seriously,'' said shift manager <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Naujokas </PERSON> at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> casino in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>. The building rattled, the glass front door shattered, and ceiling tiles were knocked down, he said. Some of the 60 to 70 card players and slot machine users cashed in their chips before evacuating the building, which is about two miles from the plant, <PERSON> Naujokas </PERSON> said. The casino closed for about three hours. `` The place -LRB- Rainbow casino -RRB- across the street never closed,'' <PERSON> Naujokas </PERSON> added. Hundreds of people were routed from their tables for about 15 minutes at <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s Town, a casino-hotel-restaurant complex about seven miles northwest of <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, acting director of advertising. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people were at the complex when the building shook slightly. Fire alarms ushered them outside. `` No one quite understood what was going on until they got outside, and then it was obvious, you could just look at the skyline,'' Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` I never heard one person complain that it interrupted their bingo and their Keno.'' The gamblers, mostly local residents, returned to their games after the evacuation. `` It does n't seem to bother them. It was like a thunderstorm that just came and went,'' said employee <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Armengo </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> made progress in U.S.-sponsored negotiations on ending the civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and will meet again in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> within weeks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> announced Wednesday. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, said the agreement to meet again was `` an important step'' toward getting Cuban and South African troops to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and securing independence for South African-controlled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We were impressed by the tone of the discussions, by the absence of polemics and the iterations of seriousness,'' <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said of the unprecedented meeting between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white generals and the Cuban and Angolan leaders. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> also raised the prospect of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> guaranteeing an eventual settlement similar to the deal for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` But it is fair to be skeptical,'' <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the two-day talks. `` There are big, tough issues that lie ahead. Gaps need to be bridged. We do not think they should be unbridgeable.'' The place and date for the talks in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has not been decided, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said. He said the talks at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel focused on an Angolan proposal put forward in March for about 40,000 Cuban troops to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in a phased withdrawal, while <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> pulled its forces out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. No specific timetable for the withdrawal was described. The Cubans went to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1975 to defend the Marxist government against pro-Western rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aids <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. South African troops are in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to back <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and attack bases of the South-West African People's Organization, or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting for Namibian independence. In past months, fighting has intensified around the strategic southern city of <LOCATION> Cuito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuanvale </LOCATION>, where Angolan and Cuban forces are apparently hanging on under attack from <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has acknowledged 50 servicemen killed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in recent months, says it has up to 3,000 troops in the country. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> says 9,000 South Africans are there with heavy artillery. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said the talks reflected improved U.S.-Soviet relations. `` There may be a mutual recognition that it could be useful if the difficulties in these negotiations are addressed periodically... between us and the Soviets and some effort made to explore how it might be possible for our two countries to support a settlement,'' he said The talks took place after <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> conferred in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last week with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> were not invited to the discussions which <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> described as confined to `` sovereign governments.'' He added that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> continued and was not part of the negotiations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying for eight years to get the Cubans out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, backed by the Soviets, have demanded a South African withdrawal <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Previous settlements have foundered partly on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s argument that it can not accede to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> demands for pre-independence elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops remain in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Earlier, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> issued a joint statement saying: `` The meeting took place in a constructive atmosphere and progress was made.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has never filed an official protest with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government over evidence that American-designed M-16 rifles built in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been sold to foreign countries in violation of a U.S.-Korean agreement, according to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found that there was little <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oversight of the program and confusion over which government agency should be in charge of the 1971 pact, which banned sales to foreign nations without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission and placed a cap on the number of rifles <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could produce. When presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials usually instructed embassy officials to remind <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of the `` seriousness'' of such sales. A strong, official government protest was never lodged, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The agreement included <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> Division of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which set up the Korean rifle plant in exchange for per-weapon royalties. Government officials told <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigators that the program's management `` was left largely to Colt. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official close to the M-16 program agreed there was some confusion over `` who was supposed to be watching every element of implementation and how much day-to-day watching was appropriate.'' The official said a `` more meticulous accounting arrangement'' may be necessary in the future. But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, defended the government's actions in following up on illegal sale evidence, saying an official government protest was not necessary and that reminding <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials of the agreement had been successful. Colt sued <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company stopped receiving royalties in 1982. That was the year the Korean government, which operated the plant, turned over ownership to <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, a private company. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said records show that <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> produced more M-16 rifles and spare parts than allowed under the agreement. It also found that M-16s and parts were sold to third parties without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission, a violation of the agreement. The third-party nations were not mentioned in the report, which was declassified. A Colt official said Tuesday that the company had evidence of M-16 sales to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sukhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the Colt suit, said <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials have told him neither the government nor <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> has sold M-16s or parts to other countries or violated the production cap. He declined further comment, citing the pending litigation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had a good safety record, a state official said Wednesday, after a series of explosions leveled the plant and a factory next door. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, administrator of the state <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said his division will investigate the explosion, which plant officials said followed a fire. `` We investigate any catastrophe,'' said <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. `` We would be looking for safety and health violations. If there were any violations, we would cite them.'' The division's maximum penalty is a fine of $ 10,000 and up to six months in jail for each violation. A final decision on fines is made by <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s boss, state Industrial Relations Director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said they are barred by law from discussing safety problems of companies.

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Wednesday refused to relinquish the $ 92,000 protocol fund that figured prominently in his impeachment trial, and his successor said she will sue to get it back. `` The people who put it in -LRB- the fund -RRB- said it belongs to me,'' said the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor. `` If we go by the intent of the giver, well, it's mine.'' On April 4, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of misusing $ 80,000 from the fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. He also was convicted of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. Upon conviction he was removed from office. On Tuesday, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> released a letter in which he gave <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> until 5 p.m. Wednesday to return the money to the office of Gov. Rose Mofford. The deadline passed without action by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> both said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> essentially determined the protocol fund was state money when it convicted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> if misusing it. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said before the deadline that she will sue to get the money back. She said she will put the money in the state general fund. The former governor said in a telephone interview he was looking forward to a lawsuit to determine whether he or the state owns the money. The fund was created with receipts from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s inaugural ball in 1987. After it was determined under state law that the money could not be used to pay off campaign debts, the <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney and the inaugural reached an agreement to put the money into a fund to finance things like receptions and gifts for visiting dignitaries. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Wednesday some of the money was spent, but he would not say how much of the $ 92,000 was left. The former governor also faces a May 19 trial on felony charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan.

<TEXT>
 An amateur radio buff was convicted Wednesday of sending a false distress report that prompted an all-out search for a downed plane Jan. 8 at the height of one of the worst snowstorms of the year. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated two hours before finding <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> guilty of making a false report to the government. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, 29, could receive up to five years in prison at sentencing July 1. `` Imagine the power he felt making this <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane run east to west and north to south,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Papps </PERSON> said, referring to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane that for nearly four hours flew low over risky terrain searching for a small downed jet with a badly injured pilot and three dead passengers. The report of the downed plane sparked a search that cost about $ 50,000 and involved up to 100 people, 20 aircraft and six police agencies. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said he will appeal on grounds of insufficient evidence. `` This case is garbage, absolute garbage,'' <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> testified he could n't have committed the hoax because he was asleep and was n't aware that a plane was reported down until he woke and turned on a police scanner. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said he then overheard the pilot tell the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane that he believed passengers were dead, that he had lost a lot of blood, was having trouble staying conscious, and could see and hear the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane overhead. That recollection conflicted with times given by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reservist who piloted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane. Other critical testimony came from <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinan </PERSON>, 24, who lived in <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s apartment building <PERSON> Dinan </PERSON> said he heard the scratchy sound of a two-way radio through an open window in <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s apartment and a clear voice saying, `` I am in trouble. I am losing blood.'' When police searched <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s apartment and a storage shed, they seized radio equipment and printed material that included the name <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, the name given to searchers by the man who said he was the injured pilot. The materials also contained highlighted references to radio frequency used that night and information about police emergency codes.

 Hundreds of mourners, some shouting `` Marcos! <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>!'' packed a Mass Wednesday for <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother after the government refused her deathbed wish to let the ousted president come home. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> cited national security for her decision to stop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, exiled in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, from coming home. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> vowed to `` exhaust all possibilities'' to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Former <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> Cabinet members were among the crowd in a suburban church for the Mass for <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, 95. Vice President <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, who sent a wreath of white orchids, arrived after the Mass. He said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return `` could divide the country further'' but told reporters the former president should be allowed to attend the funeral. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, a distant cousin of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, sent a wreath of yellow orchids, but the crowd refused to allow the wreath inside the church. `` That color is sickening,'' shouted a man. Yellow was Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s color during her campaign against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was deposed in February 1986 in a military-civilian uprising. Some people shouted, `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>!'' as Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' coffin was brought in The Mass was said in honor of Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, but was not a funeral Mass. No funeral or burial date was set. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized Sunday suffering from pneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure. She died Wednesday as Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and key government ministers discussed her deathbed appeal. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to several coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, whose husband, opposition leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983. `` After careful assessment in consultation with the leadership of both chambers of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> committee, I regret that considerations of national welfare, which are above the individual interest, forbid us from allowing the former president to return,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had told air force cadets Monday that the threat from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters had been neutralized. But police said Wednesday they seized more than 40 rifles, 300 sticks of dynamite and hundreds of rounds of ammunition during two raids this week on buildings owned by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters.

<HEAD>Starstruck British Press Has Predictable Field Day With Reagan
Revelation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The revelation that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife consult astrologers was greeted by the British press Wednesday with the sort of relish that even the sorriest soothsayer could have predicted. `` White House Watchers Wild about <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> the ` Stargazer,''' blared the headline in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, which went on to report that `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was abuzz with claims ... that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> really believes what the stars foretell.'' Newspapers in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> gave relatively straightforward coverage to the president's denial Tuesday that his policies or decisions were influenced by astrology. But their British counterparts could not resist poking fun at the Reagans or the former administration officials who have revealed juicy White House gossip. `` There is no wrath like that of a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide, apparently,'' said the Independent newspaper. `` Or, to put it another way, former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aides will do anything to get their memoirs on the best-seller list.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, reportedly asserts in a forthcoming book that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly consulted astrologers in shaping the president's schedule. The tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> devoted almost an entire inside page to the hubbub. It also listed _ under the banner headline `` Star Struck!'' _ the famous people who purportedly sought insight from astrologers. Among them were <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> and <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> once wrote that `` astrology was a science in itself -LRB- that -RRB- ... taught me many things,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, the 16th-century English monarch, rarely acted without the advice of astrologer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, and French emperor <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> commissioned at least two astrological charts and `` placed his trust in the movement of the stars,'' she added. A sober headline in the Independent said `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Takes a Dim View of Star-Gazing Tales'' while the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' banner headline proclaimed, `` <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s Star-Struck White House.'' In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> bannered the story saying `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Governed by the Stars'' while the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Expressen </ORGANIZATION> had a large picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, What's the Stars Predicting for Today?''

 Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> broke his silence Wednesday to deny taking bribes from drug smugglers as claimed at the trial of reputed cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>. `` I have never been offered a bribe and have never accepted a bribe,'' he said in a statement released to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bureau chief of <ORGANIZATION> Bahamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, a government news agency. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s government had repeatedly said it would not comment on allegations made at <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial until it was over. The defense rested Monday without calling any witnesses. Several witnesses at the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> trial, which is expected to go to the jury next week after six months of testimony, have charged <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> filled his pockets with money from smugglers such as <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, who allegedly used <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> as a transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Bill'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, 42, a marijuana smuggler, testified in February about paying $ 3 million to $ 5 million in bribes to <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> also testified <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was paying <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> a flat $ 200,000 a month. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, in accepting what he believed was an open invitation to perjure himself in plea bargaining, told a story about me that is patently false and a complete fabrication, which can easily be shown to be such by even a casual observation of the alleged facts and the circumstances he described,'' the Pindling statement said. According to recent news reports, grand juries in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> are looking into <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s affairs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, whose district includes <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, has refused comment on the claim. `` I would be surprised, however, if anything came out of those investigations,'' <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> said. `` This is so because the testimony given concerning me is totally and absolutely untrue.'' <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s name has frequently been tied to drug investigations. In 1984, a royal commission of inquiry in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> found that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> had more money than known income, but that none of that appeared to be drug-related. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> won re-election a year ago, invoking the fear common to small nations in the Western hemisphere that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is meddling in their affairs. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> has been charged with smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980. He is accused of being a leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has become the first advertiser to buy commercial time on Soviet television. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a Somers, N.Y.-based unit of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it purchased five minutes of commercial time on a five-part program to be broadcast May 17-21 on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s main television channel Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the American company that represented the Soviet broadcast agency <ORGANIZATION> Gosteleradio </ORGANIZATION> in the sale said previously the going rate was $ 10,000 for a 30-second ad. Among the six commercials <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> plans to run are two 60-second spots that feature entertainer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. All six ads have already been shown on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television. The ads are to appear on the broadcast of `` Pozner in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a joint U.S.-Soviet production featuring Soviet commentator <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozner </PERSON> talking with Americans on topics such as attitudes toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and American family life. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> felt its purchase made it the first paid advertiser on Soviet television. He said that commercials are scarce on Soviet television and that <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> had been told Soviet advertisers were not charged for running their commercials. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> has been selling soft drinks in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> since 1974, and <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said it has 20 bottlers there.

 Hundreds of volunteers were graduated from military exercises Wednesday and declared ready to fight any invasion by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The nation's military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, attended the ceremony for the men and women of the so-called Dignity Battalion, and reiterated he was willing to meet with opposition leaders to bring an end to the nation's political crisis. `` We are willing to talk -LRB- with the opposition -RRB- if and when there is respect,'' he told reporters at the end of the ceremony. The Dignity Battalion was established last month as the government began to whip up nationalistic sentiment against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The volunteers have been training two to three hours a day for five weeks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed sweeping economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the commander of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces and power behind the civilian government. He is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges, which he denies. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arrived two hours late for the ceremony as unconfirmed reports circulated that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had arrived for new talks about his departure. Opposition sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were in the country. A military spokesman said he did not know if the reports were true. Although <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s late arrival was unusual, no explanation was given for the delay. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has acknowledged meeting with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy last week but denied reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he had agreed to leave his military post. During Wednesday's ceremony, the battalion members carried old M-2 carbines and M-16 rifles. They wore red-and-white caps with tiny <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> flags and white T-shirts with `` Dignity Battalion'' stamped on them. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who watched from the stands as two of the platoons demonstrated a mock assault, waved and smiled. `` Do n't run when you see this,'' an instructor told some of the women before the mock attack, showing them a smoke grenade. `` This is smoke, not tear gas.'' `` They have shown a great deal of enthusiasm,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, commander of the battalion, who said its members had been trained in light weapons. `` We are here to say ` No' to intervention and ` No' to aggression,'' said <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a battalion member. At the end of the ceremony, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stood, called the battalion to attention and shouted, `` One whole territory,'' a reference to the year 2000 when the last of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases here will be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the banks will reopen next week but with restrictions on the amount of cash depositors can withdraw. The banks were closed March 3 by government order. Banks were allowed to accept deposits on April 18 and resume other services, such as handling letters of credit, a week later. The commission said depositors will be allowed to withdraw 25 percent of the cash that was in their checking accounts as of March 3. The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, most of them foreign.

 Two families swapped their 9-year-old boys Wednesday after a court ruled that the children were switched by mistake at birth, a newspaper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Joongang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said Park Jong-tae, 44, of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, tearfully said good-bye to a boy he had believed to be his son. At about the same time, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung-shin </PERSON>, 35, in <LOCATION> Anyang </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said goodbye to <PERSON> Jong-suk </PERSON>, the boy he thought was his eldest son, the report said. `` I am glad to have my real son back, but it's a real pain to bid farewell to a boy whom I have raised with all care,'' <ORGANIZATION> Joongang </ORGANIZATION> quoted Park as saying. The paper said the switch was discovered in 1985 when the boy raised by <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, Jung-soo, had his blood type tested at school. Jung-soo's blood type was A but his parents' blood types were both <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joongang </PERSON> said <PERSON> Park </PERSON>'s wife feared her husband would think she had committed adultery so she went to the hospital where she gave birth Sept. 4, 1978. With the help of doctors, she went through records of all children born at the hospital that day, the paper said. A suspected accidental switch was discovered and the hospital arranged a meeting for the two families, the paper said. There was no doubt the children were switched because they were strikingly similar to each other's parents, it said. After discussions, the families agreed to get a formal court order to swap their children, it said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reached tentative agreement Wednesday on a job-protecting contract covering 66,000 employees in 15 states. The two-year agreement was reached after about 40 hours of non-stop bargaining. It would replace a three-year contract that runs out Sept. 14. The new pact would expire on the same date in 1990, putting <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s contract in sync with the rest of the Big Three automakers for the first time in a decade. Negotiators adapted to the No. 3 automaker the so-called pattern contract established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement will be presented Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s 140-member national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council for approval before it is put to a ratification vote next week. The pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies to keep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for any reason except slow sales. It also requires hiring of one worker for every two who leave the company. The pattern forbids plant closings except for those announced before negotiations began. In addition, the agreement includes $ 1,000 signing bonuses and lump-sum payments of 3 percent in 1989 and 1990, and provides profit-sharing for the first time. Profit-sharing will follow the formula in place at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. The Chrysler agreement also includes the union leadership's commitment to encourage its local unions to consider accepting so-called Modern Operating Agreements _ Japanese-style practices in which workers are organized into teams Talks began April 18, two to three months earlier than normal, in an effort to mend three months of discord between the company and its workers over various job security and retirement issues. `` We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve, and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>,'' union President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s chief bargainer and vice president for human resources, called the agreement `` affordable and equitable'' and said the bonus is `` in recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s contribution to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s productivity and profits during the past few years. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> contract, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract also includes the company's commitment that executives will receive neither cash nor stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula produces no payout for workers. The two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separate but related contracts covering about 7,000 former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The national contract will cover workers left on the job after a former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> plant employing 5,500 in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, closes.

 An attorney for a woman who got AIDS during a 1983 transfusion charged Wednesday that the blood bank that supplied the tainted blood neglected to take adequate precautions against the deadly disease. <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s lawsuit against a blood bank and two doctors opened Wednesday before a six-person jury in <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Similar suits have been filed, but lawyers said this may be the first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an AIDS victim's claim against a blood bank. In a 1986 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case, a jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the trial ended. `` It was just like a time bomb, waiting to send an AIDS virus into a person's body. That person turned out to be <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said of the plasma supplied to his client after she was injured in a gun accident. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said in his opening statement Wednesday that testimony would show the doctor who treated <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> used the blood bank's plasma despite offers by family members to share their blood because of their concern about AIDS <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Dolores </LOCATION>, is suing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, whose blood bank in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, supplied the contaminated blood; Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s doctor; and Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> infectious disease expert who first tested <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> for exposure to AIDS. <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON> told the jurors they will have to base their decision on scientific knowledge at the time and the judgment that was used. `` You will hear from doctors ... that there is a risk ... that any blood transfusion can carry some disease,'' Irish said. The blood bank's lawyers earlier said tests for detecting AIDS in blood were not available until two years after the woman was infected. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> was not even in charge the night the woman was treated. <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaudon </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> was called in as a consultant and `` saw the patient on frequent visits, spent time with her, answered her questions and talked with her.'' Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> is presiding over the case, which began with jury selection on Monday. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 53, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, claims his wife's illness affected the couple's sex life and potentially exposed him to AIDS as well. The Quintanas seek `` substantial damages,'' but their lawsuit does not name an amount, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> has had full-blown AIDS since September 1987, but her husband's tests have been negative, said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> has not had an easy time since <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> was told she has AIDS,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Thank goodness he's not infected, but they did n't know that at the time'' they had sexual relations after the transfusion. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> was brought to <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cortez </LOCATION> in May 1983 for treatment of an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot wound, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> was the doctor who treated her, he said. `` One hour later, that unit of frozen plasma was put into <PERSON> Susie </PERSON>'s body,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` You are going to hear evidence that over that one-hour period that <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s eldest son -RRB- could have given blood, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s husband -RRB- could have given blood.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was aware as early as January 1983 of the need to make blood safe from AIDS, identifying male homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers as high-risk groups. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, he said, issued a joint statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations following a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> meeting that January that recommended ways for the public to avoid contaminated blood. But he said the statement failed to call for blood donors to be asked about their sexual preference. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> initially tested <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> for exposure to AIDS and told her the tests were negative, and <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> that his wife did not have AIDS exposure. Biopsy tests performed in fall 1985 confirmed that <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> had been exposed to the AIDS virus, said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Controversial Amnesty Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s highest court on Wednesday upheld a law granting amnesty to military officers accused of torture and other human rights violations during the 1973-85 military regime. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 3-2 that the amnesty law of 1986 `` coincides perfectly with constitutional principles.'' The dissenting judges said portions of the law were unconstitutional, but did not elaborate. The ruling stemmed from a case brought by an unidentified man and woman who said they were tortured while in military custody in the 1970s. The law granted protection to about 100 officers accused of atrocities during military rule. Forty-eight other appeals of lower court rulings upholding the law are pending, but Wednesday's case was considered decisive. The law was approved by the official <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the main opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, after former commanding Gen. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> threatened to order accused army members to refuse to appear for trial. President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who became president when the military surrendered rule in 1985, signed the amnesty law in December 1986 under pressure from the military. According to human rights organizations, about 50,000 Uruguayans _ one in every 60 citizens _ were arrested and many were tortured during the military's harsh 12-year reign. Scores more were reported slain or missing.

 <LOCATION> WINDHOEK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Police fired rubber bullets Wednesday at thousands of black youths marching to commemorate hundreds of their countrymen killed in a South African military strike a decade ago. Inspector Kierie du Rand, a police spokesman, said the ranks of marchers swelled from an initial 400 schoolchildren to about 3,000 as the procession moved through the black township of <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, outside the capital of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. He said police used rubber bullets when the marchers reached the township police station. The <ORGANIZATION> Namibia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> estimated the number of marchers at 6,000 and said police used tear gas and truncheons as well as rubber bullets. The communications center is a news agency that works with churches opposed to South African rule of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The center said one youth was shot in the leg by the bodyguard of a pro-government tribal chief. Police reported no injuries or arrests. Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of a South African military strike on <LOCATION> Cassinga </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> town about 150 miles north of the border with <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a guerrilla war for independence for 20 years, says 582 Namibian refugees camped at <LOCATION> Cassinga </LOCATION> were killed in the attack by 370 South African paratroopers. Among the dead refugees were 120 children, the rebel group says. South African military officials contend that <PERSON> Cassinga </PERSON> was the guerrilla group's main operational base and that the attack was necessary to pre-empt guerrilla strikes in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. They say 800 guerrillas and six South African soldiers died in the battle. A military parade celebrating the Cassinga strike was held Wednesday at <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, a major South African army base in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff, said the raid had dealt the guerrilla group a blow from which it had never fully recovered, forcing it to concentrate on non-military targets.

 An avalanche swept down Mount Sissone on Wednesday and killed five skiers, raising to 25 the death toll on the Swiss alps this year, police said. The avalanche struck around noon about 9,240 feet up the mountain and was witnessed by Swiss soldiers and civilians who immediately alerted rescuers, police reported. Police said all five were well equipped for the mountain ski trip above this Upper Engadine resort and had electronic beepers that would signal search teams in an avalanche. Rescue teams with specially trained avalanche dogs were flown by helicopter and recovered the five from beneath seven feet of snow, police said. All were pronounced dead on the scene.

<TEXT>
 The release of three French hostages by pro-Iranian kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> follows reports of intense diplomatic activity on their behalf by Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government. There was no immediate indication whether <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> made concessions in talks with representatives of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials refused to answer questions about the negotiations. There were unconfirmed reports in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in recent days that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had agreed to pay <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> $ 670 million, the amount owed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on a billion-dollar loan made by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. Payments were frozen by the French government after the 1979 Islamic revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Ten French hostages have been freed since the conservative premier took office in March 1986. The government says an 11th hostage was killed. Although <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government has denied making deals, releases often coincided with expulsions of Iranian exiles, cash payments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on a disputed loan or other apparent concessions. The final releases occurred four days before <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> faces President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a Socialist, in the presidential runoff election. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> trails in opinion polls and commentaries have said release of the hostages could give him the boost he needs. Politicians on both sides saluted the release of journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> and diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, and denied that there would be political ramifications. `` The first politician who declares that this liberation was obtained for the electoral calendar, that politician will dishonor himself,'' said <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Juppe </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> campaign. `` I do n't want to make it an electoral game, but you have to have the courage to say it. ... When <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> came to power there were 10 Frenchmen held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Today there are none.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernu </PERSON>, a former Socialist defense minister, said: `` We must not mix up these two things. Frenchmen and Frenchwomen know that in a liberation of this kind, no partisan exploitation is possible.'' After <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> announced the release at a campaign rally in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, however, the audience began chanting: `` We're going to win! We're going to win!'' Families of the freed hostages reacted with joy undiluted by considerations of secret dealing or politics. <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> told The Associated Press her husband's release was `` a great present.'' Interviewed on French television as she drank champagne with friends and relatives, Mrs. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said she got the first word by telephone from the wife of French special envoy <PERSON> Jean-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiani </PERSON>, but thought the call a hoax. `` I'm sorry; I took it badly,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> said. `` I told her, ` I've had enough with jokes this past month.' She was very disappointed. She said, ` You can believe me or not, but I am <PERSON> Marchiani </PERSON>'s wife. They called me from there -LRB- <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB- and told me to tell you this, so there.''' Among the mysteries of the sudden release was a possible connection with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s expulsion Tuesday of Syrian businessman <PERSON> Omran </PERSON> <PERSON> Adham </PERSON> under procedures of `` absolute urgency.'' He was involved in previous efforts to free the hostages. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> said, without giving sources, that the expulsion was prompted by an article in the pro-Syrian <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haqiqa </PERSON> saying <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had sent negotiators to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> asked for arms in exchange and `` <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> responded favorably,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haqiqa </PERSON> reported. The French paper said <PERSON> Adham </PERSON> `` inspired'' the article. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haqiqa </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> paid 50 million francs -LRB- $ 9 million -RRB- for the release last November of French hostages <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON>. French officials have denied paying ransom and insist they have not dealt directly with terrorists, only with governments like <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s that might have influence with the captors. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had offered to help win the release of French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> repaid the $ 1 billion loan made before the Islamic revolution, cracked down on Iranian exiles and stopped selling arms to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has been at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since September 1980. French officials said privately <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also sought its own supplies of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> arms and freedom for five men convicted in a 1980 attempt to assassinate <PERSON> Shapour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>, the last prime minister before <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> was overthrown in February 1979.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s attorney general withdrew from an investigation of Gov. Rose Mofford's financial-disclosure forms Wednesday, citing a possible conflict of interest in his being next in line to succeed her. <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> agreed to take over the investigation from Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, who is prosecuting former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on charges of omitting a $ 350,000 loan from his disclosure forms. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she saw no conflict to having <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> investigate her and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> should handle the probe for the sake of consistency, but <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he considered it inappropriate because he might be accused of benefiting from Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s ouster or of having partisan motives. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> are Republicans while <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> are Democrats. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said he had agreed to take the case because he felt he could probably `` do it well, quicker than anybody else and at a lower cost than if they had to appoint a special prosecutor.'' `` This is clearly a damned if you do and damned if you do n't case,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> added, predicting that Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s supporters would accuse him of partisanship if he brought charges against her and that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s supporters would accuse him of throwing the case if he declined to press charges against her while <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> proceeds with the case against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` Since I am not running for re-election, I feel that I am perfectly positioned,'' he said. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> accepted after <LOCATION> Pima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> declined to take the case, said <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> did not return calls to his office Wednesday, and a spokeswoman, <PERSON> Kathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, said he would not explain why he had decided against taking the case. `` I did n't ask him,'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. `` I assume he had his reasons.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, elected as secretary of state, succeeded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> upon his impeachment and removal last month. Her replacement as secretary of state can not become governor because he was appointed rather than elected, and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> is the next highest elected official. As secretary of state for 10 years, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> was in charge of explaining disclosure requirements for state officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> disclosed on April 22 that she had not reported loans, land holdings and partnerships dating back to 1978, and Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, saying she had made `` an honest mistake,'' filed amended reports a week later. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has said that his legal troubles also stem from `` an honest mistake,'' and he accused <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> on Wednesday of `` ducking the issue'' by delegating the job instead of taking the case to a grand jury. `` I think he needs to be man enough to stand up and do his duty,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> had no immediate reaction to <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> taking over the case, press secretary <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> appeared relaxed Wednesday as he waited to file for amnesty by the midnight deadline for illegal aliens. He said he was n't worried whether he would receive amnesty and had no fear of being deported. After all, he said, he has been deported five times since coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nine years ago. And he keeps coming back, swimming the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. `` I've been so long here, I just make myself at home,'' <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> said while waiting for his name and number to be called at the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office. `` I've been here since 1979. I do n't even know who the president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is.'' <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, 26, was one of hundreds of illegal aliens who waited until the last two days to bring whatever documents they had to the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> INS office. Most of the last-minute applicants cited insufficient documents, money or fear as their reason for procrastinating. For <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, the reason appeared to be lack of interest. `` If they send me back to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, I figure I ca n't stay there,'' he said. `` I've spent almost half my life here. The last time I was there, I stayed three days and came back. I figure I belong here.'' <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> said he works on a ranch in <LOCATION> Konawa </LOCATION>, where he earns about $ 200 a week.

 Disclosures that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife consult astrologers have opened them to taunts from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and criticism from scientists, but the first lady is n't about to drop her longtime interest in stargazing, an aide says. `` She does n't think that there's anything wrong with it. It does n't control policy and it does n't control their lives,'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary, said Tuesday. White House officials were clearly discomfited by the revelation _ at one moment offering smiles and shrugs for reactions, at others stern denials that serious policy matters have been left to soothsayers.

 A group of world-famous scientists intent on debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> use `` superstition'' and `` mystical fortune telling'' to make decisions. The practice, said the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, harks back to ancient times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune tellers for advice. `` We are concerned by the apparent return to medieval superstitition,'' the statement said. `` Dozens of tests in recent years by scientists can find little, if any, evidence for astrological claims. Horoscopes have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting future events.'' The statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book by former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the book says, also regularly reads his horoscope. The White House later confirmed the Reagans' interest in astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions.

 Not all the animals running loose in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are dogs, cats or freewheeling cab drivers. It IS a jungle out there. `` I do n't expect to see a zebra, but then again this is <LOCATION> Fun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> so you'll never know,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watford </PERSON>, head of rescue services for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In 28 years with the humane society, <ORGANIZATION> Watford </ORGANIZATION> has seen alligators, baboons, bears, barn owls, caimans, chimpanzees and eagles. Foxes, horses, lambs, lions, mandrills and monitor lizards. Parrots, peregrine falcons, pigs, raccoons, sea turtles and sheep. Swans, tarantulas and tigers. They all make their way to special <ORGANIZATION> ASPCA </ORGANIZATION> preserves such as the room marked `` EXOTIC ANIMALS'' at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> shelter. There, in the din of baying dogs and mewling cats, one can occasionally hear a hiss, screech or roar more common to the wilds of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> or deepest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Last year, officials say, the organization captured 5,304 exotic animals _ a category that includes everything but dogs and cats. But it takes something special to turn the head of an <ORGANIZATION> ASPCA </ORGANIZATION> veteran. `` People consider bats exotic,'' said <LOCATION> Watford </LOCATION>. `` We do n't. We get a lot of them flying through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> shelter had three quail in its exotic ward one recent day; they had been seized from a pet store because selling the birds is illegal. Two weeks earlier, the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shelter confiscated a ram from a Moslem family planning to slaughter it for a feast. In December, a South American cargo ship 400 miles offshore radioed that an osprey had crash-landed on its deck. Once the vessel was in the harbor, a shelter worker was dispatched in a motor launch to retrieve the fish-eating hawk, now on the endangered species list. In the Greatest Hits category, nothing tops the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> python that police discovered protecting a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> drug dealer's apartment. `` I've never seen anything that large, anything that weighed more than me in the snake area. And I weigh 200 pounds,'' said <LOCATION> Watford </LOCATION>. The python was estimated to weigh 300 to 350 pounds. It measured 16 feet long and at least 30 inches around at the head. In the exotic animal room, the snake stood straight up on its tail and sniffed the ceiling. Police told <ORGANIZATION> Watford </ORGANIZATION> the diet of the `` guard snake'' had been full-grown rabbits, six at a time. `` If it got around your neck, God knows what would happen,'' he said. `` It was certainly capable of swallowing a 12-year-old kid whole.'' <ORGANIZATION> Watford </ORGANIZATION> does not always know how the animals come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` How does a sea turtle end up in a bathroom in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>?'' he said with a shrug. But he does know how they come to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> ASPCA </ORGANIZATION>. They run amok. Take snakes. `` -LRB- Owners -RRB- wake up one morning and it's not where it's supposed to be. It's not in the glass aquarium. Maybe the neighbor finds it in her bathtub. Or under her bed. Or in her bed. That creates the kind of environment that is quite frightening.'' Sometimes, the animals are involved in crimes. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzo </PERSON>, a 32-year veteran of the rescue service, remembers a monkey trained to perform specialized burglaries. The owner would cut circular holes in the windows of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> liquor stores and send the monkey in for cocktails. Sometimes, the animals kill. Two years ago, a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> woman was found dead in her home near aquariums full of venom-spitting cobras. `` They're fascinating. They're beautiful,'' said <LOCATION> Watford </LOCATION>. `` People fall in love with snakes, even the most venomous type... Just a nick and it could kill you.'' Often, it is not humans but the animals who are imperiled. Scores of barnyard animals have been confiscated before they could be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. `` We take a dim view of the killing of any animal,'' said <LOCATION> Watford </LOCATION>. Once captured, the animals are given to zoos, sent to animal farms or, when possible, released into the wild. They are not returned to their owners; keeping exotic animals is against <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> health codes. The owners, who sometimes have invested thousands of dollars, do not always relinquish the beasts gracefully. Police took custody of an ocelot after the forest cat ripped open both arms of its mistress, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> woman. Her arms were placed in casts, and her cat was placed with the <ORGANIZATION> ASPCA </ORGANIZATION>. When she came to visit, shelter workers left her briefly alone with her pet and she was next seen trying to spirit the ocelot out the door, cradling it in her casts.

 The faces of the rowers looked as cold and wind-stung as early morning on the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Oars ripped into the tea-colored <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> to the cadence of the coxswains. The tension was acute. Six women were trying out for the four remaining port-side rowing seats available for a race in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, one of the last major events before the Summer Olympic trials in June. `` Now switch seat three,'' ordered Coach <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> over a megaphone. <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> maneuvered her motorboat around the two racing shells, watching to see how the shift affected their speed. She took a few notes on a dog-eared pad, but she instantly detected the stronger rower. <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> would arrange six five-minute races before deciding on the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> team. `` The anxiety level is tremendous these days,'' <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> said. `` The Olympics has everyone on edge. Now, everything is on the line all the time. It's tough mentally as well as physically.'' For more than a year, the lives of about a dozen elite female rowers have centered on the weathered <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> boathouse down the street from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>. For some, the old building will be a gateway to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` It's come down to this, and everyone is looking for the little edge, that little extra, to put them on the team,'' said <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON>, a coxswain on the 1980 team pulled from the Olympics by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boycott protesting the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Except for an unlikely surge by a college team in upcoming races, the Olympic women's team will come from the <ORGANIZATION> BRC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pocock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A series of lesser races culminates with the June 22-26 nationals in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, the most important event in selecting the members of the four-and eight-member shells and the single scullers. Slowly, outside lives have dissolved for the rowers, who came from around the country to the <ORGANIZATION> BRC </ORGANIZATION> last year. Jobs, such as carpenter and physical therapist, have been abandoned as the training intensified. `` There's a feeling that time is running out,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 24, who came to train at the <ORGANIZATION> BRC </ORGANIZATION> after graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and rowed with the eight-member team that placed second behind <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in last year's world championships in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. `` There are so many peaks you go through, you just try to stay on top as the Olympics near.'' For 31-year-old <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, the 1988 games may mean a last chance for an Olympic medal she missed by two-tenths of a second four years ago in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I try to keep my mind off the Olympics,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a member of five national teams since beginning to row competitively six years ago. `` The emotional tension would be just too exhausting.''

<HEAD>First Collection of Asian Export Art Unveiled At Peabody Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1799, thousands of artisans in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and other ports in the Orient were crafting elaborate objects from porcelain, silks, ivory, silver and rare woods for export to the West. But the goods made by <ORGANIZATION> Easterners </ORGANIZATION> for Western commercial consumption never have been treated as a separate, scholarly discipline or gathered in one place. Enter the <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>, which calls itself the nation's oldest continuously operating museum. The museum will dedicate an $ 8.1 million new wing to house the first permanent collection of Asian export art in the world on May 14. `` We consider the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> influence on our decorative arts second only to the classical influence of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, curator of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> export collection. `` Our debt to <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> culture and our awareness of these influences needs to be more emphasized.'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and other scholars in the field spent over 20 years promoting the concept of a field devoted to the disparate objects, materials, styles and destinations of Asian decorative art. The collection is a combination of 2,000 pieces from the Peabody, established by the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1799, and 8,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, located in a home built by a sea captain in 1833. The two merged in 1984 and the new museum is the first to treat products exported from the Orient as one body of art. The <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Museum </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> contains a small gallery with about 120 items of Chinese export art, and other museums display random pieces of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> made items. About 1,000 objects are displayed in the <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>'s three-story new wing, a well-lighted and spacious area that features central displays explaining the key components of Asian trade <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said exports from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began as early as 1498 and flourished after 1557, when the Portuguese settled <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, giving Westerners a formal presence in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and opening a permanent market to the West. `` Those voyages of exploration and discovery that started in the 15th century and attempted to find the route to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> were primarily to obtain spices, which were sort of essential to the rich,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. The Spanish began regular trips in the late 16th century, while the British and <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> companies were established in the early 17th century. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said American colonists first imported goods through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> then set up direct trade with the Orient. Chinese porcelain has been found at trading posts in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, he said. In the 18th century alone, when the trade peaked, about 40 million pieces of porcelain were exported to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Newspapers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> frequently advertised up to 20 different kinds of Oriental cotton into the early 19th century. Asian-export decorative arts were made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>, now known as <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Tea, coffee, spices, textiles and porcelain accounted for about 90 percent of the exports; the rest were special orders such as furniture, paintings and carved wood. The Peabody's collection includes Chinese porcelains owned by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>; a pair of lacquer card tables brought to <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> 50 years before <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> opened to trade in 1854; a silver cup dating to 1840 depicting a rowing race between foreigners on the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>; and a massive `` moon bed'' made for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> centennial in 1876. `` The quality of goods in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> was very high,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` The materials were there _ you could have lacquers, porcelains and silks that were not available in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Because wages were low and raw materials abundant, the products were cheap for Western consumers; importers paid the local rate for silver and another 15 percent to 25 percent for labor, compared to a 100 percent markup in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The influence of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> export art ranges from pavilions and pagodas depicted in ceramics and wallpapers to the fluting on teapots made by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> silversmith <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>. In addition, the community of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> artisans _ some 250,000 in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> alone from 1750-1842, `` was in touch with Western influences and applied itself to making these remarkable objects,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. This cultural dichotomy was never reflected in Western collections because <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> export art was scattered in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The style was considered both Asian and European, and as such scholars pushed it aside, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` For the first time people will see the variety and richness of the field,'' he said. `` People will see that it started in the late Middle Ages and comes up right to the present.''

<HEAD>Panama's Health System Suffering as Crisis Drags On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The signs are everywhere that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s health system has been thrown into disarray by the nation's political and economic crises. An entire floor of one hospital is boarded up and closed. Thousands of doctors and nurses have been sent home on unpaid vacations. Pharmacists are running out of everything from heart medicine to surgical gloves. `` We're living on borrowed time,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Casco </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, a prominent physician. Since <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> became a cash-only society with the closing of banks March 4 because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic restrictions, it has been hard, often impossible, for patients to pay their medical bills, for hospitals and clinics to pay their workers, for pharmacists to pay suppliers. Government hospitals began turning away all but emergency cases in March during a five-week strike by doctors and nurses demanding payment of their salaries. In time, patients stopped going to the dentist or seeking elective surgery and laboratory tests because of the money problems and the uncertainty. One 28-year-old woman said she has delayed a hysterectomy for two months and wonders if she'll develop complications during the wait. `` I told my doctor that I'm optimistic,'' the woman said. `` He told me he's pessimistic.'' <PERSON> Casco </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said patients with serious problems are being cared for. Health Minister <PERSON> Franciso </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said a 25 percent drop has been noted in the number of people seeking medical care at government-run hospitals and clinics. `` The Panamanian people have understood they should go for medical services only when it is really required,'' he said. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> denied reports from medical associations of shortages of food and medicines in state facilities. At the same time, he acknowledged that the cash-starved government has requested and received a donation of drugs from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and is expecting more from other sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> agreed to put the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> antibiotics through laboratory tests after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacists </ORGANIZATION> questioned the quality of the drugs. Doctors and nurses at government clinics say they are working only 12 hours a week instead of the usual 40. The modern, four-story <ORGANIZATION> Paitilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a private hospital, has closed off its second floor. Dr. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a dentist, said the private <ORGANIZATION> Arango </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> where he works is opened only half a day and half the 45-member staff has been sent home on unpaid vacations for a month. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> added that some of his patients have been unable to pay even part of their bills. `` But if somebody comes to you and is pain, what are you going to say?'' he said. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medico </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest medical supply firm, said his sales fell to $ 9,000 in the first three weeks of April from a monthly average of $ 500,000 before the crisis He added that his warehouse is 75 percent empty and some of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers are refusing to sell him more supplies until he pays his bills. <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON> said he has large and small rubber surgical gloves but is out of medium sizes and has run out of units for intravenous feeding. He has casting material for setting broken bones but has run out of the stockings that are put on a patient's foot before the cast is set. <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON> said he recently sold his last two tubes used in cases where brain fluid must be drained. `` I'm the only supplier of those in the country,'' <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON> said. `` And if you run out of those, the patient is a goner.'' Pharmacists say they are running short of some of the most commonly used drugs, including some heart medicines, antibiotics and tranquilizers. Druggist <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said his sales of tranquilizers are up 30 percent. `` Demand is up because there is a lot of tension over what's happening in this country,'' he said But psychiatrist <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said he is seeing 30 percent fewer patients. `` In my field we know there are people who feel down or stressed _ we call it nerves _ but they'd rather live with it than spend the $ 50 an hour,'' he said. `` The stress level of the whole community is way up,'' he added. `` My own is too.''

<HEAD>New Policy To Protect Burial Grounds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE M. ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SENECA ROCKS, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 18th-century graveyard on the grounds of a new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> campground will be left intact through a trial policy adopted this year to recognize the religious views of American Indians. The gravesite, which forest service archaeologist <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> believes dates from at least 1791, contains no remains of any tribal members. But the policy, put into effect Jan. 29 by the forest service, encompasses all human burial grounds, regardless of race. `` It comes down to First Amendment freedom of religion rights,'' <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. The gravesite policy was developed in conjunction with American Indian and archaeology groups, she said. It is in effect in the Eastern and Southern regions of the forest service, which include land east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and will be put into effect nationwide if successful. Pre-historic American Indian sites, as well as homesteads dating from the 17th, 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, are scattered throughout <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, archaeologists believe. `` We've had lots of problems, both at the federal and state and graverobber levels, where desecration was taking place with increasing frequency,'' said <PERSON> Suzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harjo </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any place where there are Indian remains, it takes place.'' Although the plan specifies that the graves should be left undisturbed if possible, it does make provisions for scientific study, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. `` We need to be allowed to study and obtain samples of material _ that's going to be a bone of contention,'' <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. The policy would allow some human remains to be exhumed, but only after the forest service consults with the tribes involved, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. Any human remains exhumed must be returned to the ground, she said. `` The issue is a pan-tribal concern,'' <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. `` It actually represents two conflicting world views _ archaeology as a science and what we know about descent and cultural practices, and religious views. `` The Western European view of death relating to one's ancestors is so different than Native Americans' view of death and ancestry,'' <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. `` It's a deeply personal and spiritual thing for some of them.'' Tribal groups, especially in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> area and in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, were concerned that their ancestors were being unearthed from public lands with little concern for the tribes' religious beliefs. <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said the new policy was sparked by complaints from American Indians about national forests in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which are rich in tribal artifacts. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has also developed a tough policy to protect gravesites, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. The forest service policy requires that agency workers in each state deal directly with tribes to work out a plan to handle each specific gravesite, regardless of whether it belongs to those tribes. `` They feel that the tribal affiliation is not important,'' <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. `` Descecration of one is descecration of all.'' In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where no active <PERSON> American </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes are left, administering the policy would be slightly different, she said. `` It will involve making good faith efforts to research who the people are in those graves,'' <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. The tiny graveyard at <ORGANIZATION> Seneca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocks </ORGANIZATION> is nearly hidden by brush. The graves, some marked by worn rocks that once were headstones, resemble shallow trenches. <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said the indentations could indicate the people were buried in coffins. The forest service archaeologist said she believed the graveyard was in use for 50 to 60 years. One headstone contains a barely decipherable inscription including the year 1791. The hill, overlooking <ORGANIZATION> Seneca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocks </ORGANIZATION>, was a popular homesite for settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. Walking through the future campground, she identified several signs indicating people had lived there. Chips and flakes of stone, unearthed when workers leveled the ground for the campsite, show the site also was inhabited by American Indians, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. `` There must be some great spiritual significance the site held, but we'll never know,'' she said. The graveyard will be preserved in place, and <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said the forest service may clean it up and post some explanatory signs. Archaeologists say hundreds of historical homesites are located throughout the region, although many are hard to identify. `` One difficulty of managing historic sites in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is you ca n't see them.'' Except for such artifacts as stone chips, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said, `` there's nothing there _ it's not like the big stone pyramids in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' Many of the sites were occupied from the post-Civil War period to the Depression, but prehistoric American Indian camps also are scattered throughout the area, <PERSON> Brashler </PERSON> said. `` They give a really nice indication that even the mountains were occupied for thousands of years,'' she said.

<HEAD>RX for Long-Term Investing: DRPs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an era when the investment climate seems as changeable as the spring weather, it takes a special discipline to think long-term in managing your money. But many of the typical investor's financial objectives require long-term strategies _ retirement planning, for example, or saving to pay a child's college tuition. Thus, say many advisers on personal financial matters, now may be a particularly appropriate time to check into stocks of companies that offer dividend reinvestment plans, or DRPs. `` Stocks?'' you might well say. `` I do n't want any part of stocks, they way the market goes up 80 points, down 100, and that computer program trading ...'' Well, the point of systematic investing through some arrangement like a dividend reinvestment plan is to smooth out all that short-term volatility and maybe even turn it to your advantage. The first corporate DRPs were created in the 1960s, based on an idea borrowed from mutual funds, where they had long been popular and remain so to this day. The basic principle is simple: Instead of sending stockholders a check for their quarterly dividends, the company in question automatically invests the payout in more shares for their accounts. As DRPs spread, they acquired extra features. Beyond the dividend, some companies offered participants the right to invest additional cash at no charge. Owners of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> stock, for example, can invest as little as $ 10 or as much as $ 5,000 each quarter. At <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, the range is $ 20 to $ 5,000. As a further inducement, some companies issued stock to <ORGANIZATION> DRP </ORGANIZATION> participants at discounts of 3 percent to 5 percent below the market price. Though these discounts have been growing scarcer lately, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> still counts 47 exchange-listed stocks that offer them, including such familiar names as <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Utilities and <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>. Even without a discount, the savings on brokerage commission costs can be significant. Traditionally, most companies with DRPs have charged no fees or only a modest service charge to buyers. DRPs plainly are not for people who need current income from their savings or who are looking to make fast trading profits. But that's just the point. With regular investing in a DRP, you gain the benefit of dollar cost averaging. Your money buys more shares per dollar when the price is low. `` If you're investing in specific companies for the long term, dividend reinvestment offers a sound forced-savings technique that could be particularly attractive for retirement plans or children's funds,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, publisher of the financial newsletter <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> Reports in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. DRPs come with no Dollar-cost-averaging wo n't help much if you do it in a stock that falls into the basement and takes up permanent residence there. These programs require some good record-keeping for tax purposes. What's more, the dividends you reinvest count as taxable income in the year in which they are paid, even though you do n't actually receive the money You wo n't find brokerage firms volunteering much information on DRPs, since these plans bypass brokers. But if a company's stock looks good enough to you to warrant a long-term commitment, you can determine what sort of <ORGANIZATION> DRP </ORGANIZATION>, if any, it offers by inquiring directly at its shareholder relations office. Several independent investment advisory services and investor groups offer information and, in some cases, active help in DRP investing. Some examples: <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's offers a current brochure listing almost 600 companies with DRPs -LRB- Price: $ 2. Write <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dept. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25 Broadway, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> NY 10004 -RRB-. A more elaborate directory of some 1,000 companies, describing details of each plan, is published by <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, P.O. Box 763, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>, Md. 20707, which charges $ 24.95.

 Businessman <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> met <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> across a negotiating table in 1981 when <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> 7Up </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was pressuring corporations to expand opportunities for blacks. They met several times with subordinates and alone, coming up with a `` covenant'' under which 7Up agreed to spend $ 61 million to improve its minority hiring and spending program. Today, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says, ` I am a Republican, but if <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is the -LRB- Democratic -RRB- nominee, I will vote for him.'' `` He never one time wanted us to give something to somebody. He wanted us to give opportunity,'' for blacks, which ultimately was great for the 7Up business, recalled <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, now a <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> vice president. It was a different side of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and other corporate executives saw _ different from the man the public had come to know as a fiery spokesman for black concerns, who led street demonstrations, railed against City Hall, blasted the administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and spouted militant rhetoric. The public <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as head of his civil rights organization Operation PUSH -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, was honing his skills as a champion headline grabber, always able to seize on an issue or tactic that would put PUSH in the news. During those years, he began to develop a less flamboyant side, with the tactics of conciliatory persuasion that he is showcasing in his campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. For instance, he was given credit for successful mediation of the devastating 1980 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> firefighters' strike _ 22 people died in fires during the strike _ after marathon sessions with blacks, who were insisting on affirmative action before they would unite with white unionists, and with white firefighters and city officials. That side of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has become more dominant in the years since his 1984 presidential bid. Gone are the dashikis, blue jeans and leather vests that were the uniform of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s youthful protest days. Also gone is much of the confrontational rhetoric typified by his remarks on the day he launched PUSH in 1971: `` Power must not be blind. It must be used ... to picket, vote and if necessary to engage in civil disobedience ... We will be as nonviolent as we can be, and as violent as we must be.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, it is difficult to find many associates who do n't offer the observation that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has grown and matured since those days Today, in impeccable business suits and silk ties, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> projects himself as a conciliator and mediator, holding himself above the fray of campaign attacks and holding out the promise of understanding to all constituencies. Even in the heat of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, when Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a liar, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brushed it off. One former critic, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> radio commentator <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, says he set aside his misgivings about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> after determining his ego was n't as big as it used to be. `` I was one of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s greatest critics in the 70s. I was not convinced he was as serious about the movement as he was about himself,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` I had quit attending PUSH because I was convinced <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> was not for real. Now I'm one of his biggest supporters.'' But some say it's the old <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a new package. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>. Everything else is No. 2,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, former owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He declined further comment. Many who have been critical in the past seem reluctant to say anything negative about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> today as he glows in the successes of his presidential campaign. Former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was always capable of both protesting and trying to bring people together. `` I do n't see him any different today,'' she said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers point out that times have changed since the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> as a semininary student in the early 1960s _ and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has changed with them. `` Those were the days when he was absolutely confrontational,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> H.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brookins </PERSON> of the African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a longtime ally. `` That was the only way he got coverage was to be confrontational ... He's much more thoughtful now than he once was. I attribute that to maturing at the public level.'' In the PUSH days, when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was fighting to improve the economic and political clout of blacks, he achieved many of his goals through boycotts or the threat of boycotts, public attacks on adversaries during revival-style PUSH meetings and an ability to mobilize black followers. Recognized today as a master at using the news media, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made every effort to cultivate reporters, especially those from the black press, said <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, a former PUSH spokesman and now editor of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A workaholic who has skimmed several newspapers by 6 a.m., <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> knew how to make headlines, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said. He gave his staff tips on how to give reporters short, snappy quotations. `` He did not hesitate to call up editors and make his views known on editorials and stories,'' and before long <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the one who was called by reporters for comment on the various civil rights stories of the day. `` If I was critical of him, he'd almost always call and try to talk it out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Royko </PERSON>. `` Even if I was 100 percent right, I'd spend the next three days walking around with my liberal guilt throbbing.'' <PERSON> Royko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to persuade rather than intimidate him. But a former <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> official said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would make threatening calls `` unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> did exactly what he wanted.'' `` He would say it was anti-black,'' and threaten to make a public uproar over the matter, said the newspaper official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: of anonymity.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 On one occasion, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> saw a new black reporter on TV, <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> recalled. `` He started asking around the room, ` Who is that?' A week or so later, this reporter was at <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s house. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> told him he had an exclusive for him.'' That was typical of the way <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would `` cultivate anybody who could do him a favor,'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has a knack of going around picking up people like some people pick up stray dogs.'' `` He certainly was very fiery,'' in those days, said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> political consultant <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who now says his previously reported description of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> conniving to grab the mantle of the slain Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> has been overblown. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said in a recent interview that the day after King's 1968 assassination in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> to set up a couple of TV interviews for him in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In general conversation, according to <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, the two subsequently fell to discussing how <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` had terrific potential to become the leader of the movement.'' But <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said there was no concerted plan, as he had been quoted saying, to engineer that eventuality. In any event, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for two days wore a turtleneck _ even in a King memorial service of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ stained with what he said was King's blood. He told the council: `` I come here with a heavy heart because on my chest is the stain of blood from Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s head.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s biographer, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, said that more than 100 articles in the year after King's assassination reported that <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s blood was on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s shirt and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had cradled the dying leader or that he was the last person King had spoken to. All these details are disputed by some King associates who were present on the balcony of the Lorraine motel in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> King </PERSON> was shot. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been vague in more resent interviews on the events in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. He said in an interview on television's <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> show in April that it was not true he had not touched the dying King. He said he ran up to the balcony after a sheet had been put over the body. `` I then got up from a very bloody scene,'' he said. `` Blood was everywhere.'' Mistrust of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lingers from those days. King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and some other civil rights colleagues refuse to endorse <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In his campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> frequently cites his ties to King, but the Rev. <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> city councilman, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` could never work as a team person,'' with King or other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> recalled a staff meeting where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stubbornly challenged King's ideas. `` It got so ridiculous that Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> got up and walked out. As he got to the door, he turned around and he said, ` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, if you want to start your own national orgnization you can do so, but you do n't have to destroy me ...'' Ultimately, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> split with <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> leaders over finances and the leadership of the Operation Breadbasket arm of <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> which he headed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s longtime friend and pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, contended some were jealous of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his stature and support. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, `` he was the movement,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` Without him there would n't have been any movement.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s fame grew as he took on everything from housing discrimination and youth problems and signed minority opportunity pacts with such companies as <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, Burger King, <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION> and Coca Cola. One day he would be launching boycott against <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION>, telling blacks `` Do n't choke on <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>.'' The next day he might be pledging to defeat a proposed police chief or school board member. `` Nobody wants to be on PUSH's so-called list,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` He was n't just a ragtag individual. He was head of a significant organization.'' PUSH had 32 chapters nationwide and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s weekly sermons were carried on live radio every Saturday. `` I think anybody that was in business knew about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellinger </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION>. The Schlitz-PUSH pact was signed before <PERSON> Sellinger </PERSON> arrived in the late 1970s. But he said he heard from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fought the brewery's efforts to force out an unprofitable black distributor. `` If PUSH decided to get on your case about something, you got a real fight on your hands,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` PUSH became the eyes, the ears and the feet of the black community.'' Those who dealt with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> say he was as canny and in control behind closed corporate doors as he was firing up his followers. `` It was n't a lot of yelling ... but it was, ` You're going to do this,''' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was very businesslike. I found him to be tough but fair,'' said former Schlitz spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkin </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ` ` made it clear his demands were either, or else. Former <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he never dreaded going to the PUSH negotiations. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was `` electric and charismatic,'' and a sharp negotiator.

<HEAD>EAST ST. LOUIS: cash bond.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The inmate who beat <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> was placed in the same cell even though empty cells were available. <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> said the state had repeatedly warned the city its jail was being operated unsafely. `` The city was in an indefensible position,'' he said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON>'s attacker -RRB- was only the bullet. The weapon was trained and held by the city.'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> called the case `` the avalanche that broke the camel's back If not that, it would be something else.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> has long suffered a rough, ugly reputation. Its history of gangsters, gambling dens and gun battles in the streets has been updated only in the particulars, especially in politics. Last year, for example, a candidate for alderman was arrested hours before the polls opened for barging into a radio station and threatening to shoot another candidate, the host of a call-in show. Charges were dismissed. Since 1980, guilty pleas have been entered by a police captain who took bribes, a sergeant who sold drugs, a precinct committeeman who committed murder and a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> board member charged with unlawful use of a weapon _ he shot at a man he mistakenly thought stole his car, said <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON>. Two of last year's mayoral candidates were convicted in years past of extortion, and a third was found guilty of forging government checks and mail fraud. One had also pleaded guilty to trying to arrange another's murder. <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> himself faces trial on charges of misusing city money to buy campaign advertisements for Officer. Other charges are pending against Officer's administrative assistant and a second man, a convicted rapist and unsuccessful aldermanic candidate. The city denies allegations that some police go without cars or radios or cope with equipment in dangerously poor repair. <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> said some police have bought their own radios and detectives have used their own cars. If a cop `` gets shot at, how does he get help? He does n't,'' <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> said. `` If he tries to get away ... -LRB- in -RRB- some of the cars, you've got to roll down the window to get out of the car.'' Because of the ever-rising crime problem, state troopers were called in two years ago to help fight gangs and armed bandits preying on motorists. `` The public response was overwhelming,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, state police spokesman. `` People would wave to them from windows. It's like the vets from World War II coming into towns into <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It's the kind of things that brings tears to a cop's eyes.'' As of May 1, the state police had made 2,250 criminal arrests, and robberies and gang activities are down, said Capt. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. The city has received other assistance. Operating on grants, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> established an alcohol treatment center and school-work program, but the association fizzled in 1987. Former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> native and a former chairman of the community foundation, said that despite hard work from many residents and the outside aid, `` most of it was probably wasted'' due to inappropriate programs, corruption, inefficiency and poor coordination. A former foundation director offers another assessment. City leaders, said <PERSON> Handy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, `` make their own rules about everything. If you come to that community and are not prepared to play by their rules, they run you out. `` Nobody seriously gives a damn about <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> said. `` I think people who run it give a damn about their own personal fortunes.' Still, <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> and others agree hope lies along the riverfront. Bonds have been issued to build a port, a waste recycling facility and middle - and upper-income housing But some are skeptical the project will even get off the ground. Because of deadlines and legal questions, there's `` very little evidence -LRB- the projects -RRB- will come to fruition,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, executive director of Target 2000, a private economic development firm. A management company has sued the city for breach of contract, alleging that a man acting for Officer tried to solicit a $ 500,000 finder's fee and, when no money was paid, the company was illegally dropped from two riverfront projects. Even if Officer's plans fail, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> is confident the riverfront will be developed. He mentioned other plans for rejuvenation, including a proposal to extend a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> park across the river and make a national park. <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> admits that promoting the city is n't easy. `` People tend to discount it automatically,'' he said. `` Once they get past it, they're surprised at what they find. ... The perception is worst than the reality.''

<TEXT>
 Banks will reopen for nearly normal operations next Monday after being closed for two months because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president, said in a television interview that to avoid a run on the banks, the amount of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted. `` We are trying to reactivate the economy of the country,'' <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON> said. `` We will take care of the public in all banking activities'' within the restrictions set by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> late in March, he said. Conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25 percent of checking account balances as of March 3, the day the government ordered banks closed. It sets a maximum of $ 10,000, with the rest frozen for 90 days. Withdrawals of up to $ 50 may be made from savings accounts one month after banks reopen. Payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash availability in each bank. The commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks. On April 18, it let them begin accepting deposits. Because of limits on withdrawals, however, about 75 percent of the checks deposited bounced, analysts and business people said. A week later, about a dozen additional services were resumed, including handling letters of credit; collecting outstanding loans; transferring funds within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and making foreign exchange transfers. But business people said the operations were largely on paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity and credit. The association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here, most of them foreign. Both the March 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67 banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international banking business. Others also closed their doors because of the impact of the crisis. Some closed as early as late February, after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> following the president's attempt tried to fire the military strongman. The political instability, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and the lack of banking facilities brought <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy to a near-standstill. The <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had urged the banks to reopen with some restrictions intended to `` maintain the cash position of the banks and protect depositors.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expects to continue nudging its share of the world copier market higher with a new generation of copiers offering more features at higher prices. The new 50 Series unveiled Tuesday is named in honor of the 50th anniversary of the 1938 invention of plain-paper copying. It includes <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s first personal copier, a model made for it by <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The new copiers are the successors to the 10 Series, which helped the company begin to regain market share from Japanese rivals after its inception in 1982. <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> should continue recapturing market share from the Japanese with the new machines, although the recovery will come more slowly than did the rapid decline of the 1970s and early 1980s. `` Overall, I would say they're pretty impressive,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> long had resisted introducing a personal copier, saying it could not justify the investment necessary to compete with Japanese companies such as Sharp, <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ricoh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> that dominate the low end of the market <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said that even now the company's new personal copier `` is not key to the company's strategy.'' It required only a small investment by <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, because it is being manufactured by <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> personal copier is a close cousin of <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s Z-55 except for the exterior casing, a small change in the paper-feeding mechanism and alterations in the cartridges that make it impossible for Sharp cartridges to be used in <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> copiers and vice versa. The list price of $ 1,295 for the basic model is about the same as the list price of $ 1,299 charged by <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> for its Z-55. Actual retail prices for both could be substantially lower. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> makes the other new copiers itself. The machines range in size up to the 5090 duplicator, which starts at $ 145,000, makes up to 135 copies a minute and can bind pages automatically. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, the inventor of the dry copying process, created the first xerographic image on Oct. 22, 1938. His efforts to market the invention were met with an `` enthusiastic lack of interest,'' he later recalled, until the former <ORGANIZATION> Haloid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, picked it up in the late 1950s. <ORGANIZATION> Haloid </ORGANIZATION> became <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. While the new <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> copiers can not be compared directly with their predecessors because they have more features, the prices are about 5 to 10 percent higher than 10 Series machines with similar copying speeds, said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Haythorn </PERSON>, a vice president for marketing. <PERSON> Haythorn </PERSON> said the strength of the Japanese yen made it possible for <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> to raise prices while remaining competitive with Japanese rivals. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> recently announced price increases on its 10 Series copiers. The personal copier will be sold mainly through retail stores and office products dealers and will be available to resellers and agents later this month. Order-taking for the big 5090 duplicator will begin in major cities in the second half of the year. The rest of the line will be rolled out starting in major <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> cities, beginning this month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is counter-attacking takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, its largest shareholder and most threatening potential antagonist. Alleging that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has violated securities laws, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal court Tuesday to thwart his ability to use his <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock in moves against the oil giant. The suit filed at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, asked the court for an order blocking <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> from soliciting proxies, acquiring additional <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock or voting the shares he already holds, representing a 14.8 percent stake in the company. The nation's third-largest oil company also asked the court to void <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s nomination of five candidates _ including himself _ for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 14-member board in elections to be held at the company's June 7 annual meeting in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said the purpose of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s activities was either to force the company to buy back his shares at a premium, to force its acquisition by a third party or to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and liquidate its assets _ in each case netting large profits In seeking that goal, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> claimed, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> attempted to `` deceive investors and manipulate the market for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock'' with false and misleading statements. The company said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s group also had an illegal secret agreement to coordinate its stock purchases with those of another `` substantial buyer,'' who was not named in the suit <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> repsponded with a one-sentence statement issued at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, saying: `` We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and will vigorously defend our right to communicate with other <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders.'' Since last fall, when he began buying <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares at prices between $ 29 and $ 34 per share, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been an outspoken critic of the company's management. He has offered to withdraw his slate of directors if the company puts itself up for sale for $ 55 a share or more, which <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officals have refused to do. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 62 -LCB- cents to $ 49 a share Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. Federal Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> scheduled a hearing for all parties at 10 a.m. Thursday. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> began in the last months of its multibillion-dollar legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In 1985 a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> court ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, before buying <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had improperly interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to acquire part of <LOCATION> Getty </LOCATION>. It awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> a judgment that stood at $ 10.3 billion in April 1987, when <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for federal bankruptcy court protection to avoid having to post a similar amount while appealing the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> judgment. Late last year, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> interjected himself as a mediator between the two companies. In December, without his participation, the companies agreed on a $ 3 billion settlement that formed the keystone of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization plan. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from bankruptcy last month and paid the $ 3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. It subsequently expanded its original plan to sell $ 3 billion of assets to $ 5 billion, mindful of the threat that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> might attempt to take over the company in order to sell it off piecemeal to raise the value of his shares. Among other things, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s suit alleged that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said `` he did not intend to dispose of his stock or seek control of the company, when in fact his true purpose was to force the sale of the company, acquire the company himself and liquidate it or to extract ` greenmail' from the company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> also contended that: _ <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> illegally exploited confidential information he acquired concerning the status of the settlement talks with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> in order to acquire part of his <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stake _ <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s proxy for the slate of directors he plans to run `` fails to disclose important information about both <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and his nominees,'' including previous <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charges of `` serious violations of federal proxy rules,'' and `` material arrangements or understandings he had made with members of his proxy slate.

 A stern message about proofreading that was n't proofread won one of the first annual Percy Awards given by a private writing consultant for what he deems ugly business writing `` There's a lot of bad writing out there,'' New York-based consultant <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said Tuesday in announcing his personal selections from more than 500 submitted letters, memos and directives. The name <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> comes from `` pursuant to your request,'' a phrase that he says weighs down the top of many memos. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> _ who believes bad writing costs American businesses millions of dollars a year _ said the most common business writing mistakes were poor organization, wordiness, antiquated or overblown phrases and sloppiness. The Percy-winning proofreading memo, submitted by a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> print shop employee, began this way: `` When asked to ` proof' something whether it is a letter, a bulletin, something we are printing the follwoing should be the usual procedure.'' Once readers got past `` follwoing,'' they still had to cope with `` prodedure'' for `` procedure'' and `` a rpoof'' for `` approve.'' Dishonors also went to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> memo in <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, that spent eight paragraphs explaining how to look for defects in plastic office chairs; an unintelligible letter from an assistant branch manager of a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> bank; a puzzlingly vague memo from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, magazine publisher regarding staff meetings; and a scolding memo at a <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> company that threatened the removal of bathroom stall doors if employees did n't stop smoking in there. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said his clients have included <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Mexico Will Maintain Oil Production Levels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will maintain its current level of crude production until <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agrees to cut its own production, according to the government newspaper. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> was quoted Tuesday in the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>, as saying <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would maintain its export target of 1.36 million barrels a day until the 13-member cartel reaches agreement on a production cut. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the world's sixth largest oil producer, was one of several non-OPEC producers that last week held talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> about reducing output in a joint effort to bolster sagging world prices. <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> had not rejected the proposal, and would reconsider it in the coming months. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> wound up several days of meetings Monday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, without reaching agreement on the production cutback proposal. The cuts were to be made in conjunction with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and five other non-OPEC producers, which offered to lower their output by 5 percent or about 200,000 barrels a day if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members did the same. Other non-cartel producers involved in the talks were <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. While not an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> carefully monitors its decisions and often follows its lead on pricing and production policies. The nation's economy is heavily dependent on its oil industry, which is the No. 1 source of foreign revenue needed to service its foreign debt of about $ 100 billion, the second highest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. In an effort to ease the oil dependence, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> has pushed in recent years to expand sales of non-oil goods to foreign buyers. A recent report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said the nation earned $ 1.8 billion in petroleum sales in the first three months of this year, compared to $ 3.5 billion in non-oil exports. In all of last year, the nation gained $ 7.9 billion from crude sales, a 41.2 percent increase over 1986 when oil prices plummeted on the world market. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought nearly 47 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s oil exports last year, followed by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> with 15.2 percent and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with 13.9 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the state-run oil company. Last July, the government boosted its export volume to 1.36 million barrels a day after maintaining an export target of 1.32 million barrels a day in the first half of 1987. Prior to the 1986 collapse in oil prices, the daily export platform had been 1.5 million barrels.

 A jury's failure to reach a verdict on charges that two former bank executives defrauded <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> should n't deter other probes of such white-collar crime, federal prosecutors say. `` We sent up the best trial lawyer to try an extraordinarily complex case. They did a good job,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The verdict is not going to deter us in any of our bank-fraud cases.'' After a 6 -LCB- - week trial, the jury was `` hopelessly deadlocked'' and could not reach a consensus Tuesday in the cases of former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, former executive of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The jury acquitted co-defendant <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, an oil contractor from <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, of wire fraud. The government maintained that <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> manipulated his debt-plagued co-defendants in schemes to save his own failing bank by defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Continental nearly collapsed in 1984 following a run on deposits sparked partly by revelations of bad energy loans, and survived mainly because of a $ 4.5 billion government bailout. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> vice president until the bank's July 1982 collapse, and <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> headed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' energy-lending division The government charged that <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, caught in spiraling personal debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, accepted kickbacks from <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION> in exchange for financing high-risk energy loans for <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> customers in 1981 and 1982. The indictment cited <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s involvement in $ 44 million in loans made by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to 12 Penn Square customers, many without any documentation. `` I am very disappointed,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> declared a mistrial after a week of deliberations. `` I had hoped for a resolution.'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said he would huddle for a few days with assistant prosecutors before deciding whether to seek another trial. Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>, had nothing to say to reporters. But in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Burck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, said he was disappointed. `` We were hopeful that the jury would return a verdict of not guilty, but of course we're pleased on the other hand that there was no guilty verdict returned,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> was jubilant after the jury found him innocent. `` What can I say? The dream came true,'' he said. Attorneys for <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> contended <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy, not because of a fraud scheme. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> were accused of engaging in a related `` buyback'' investment scheme that began with <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> buying into <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>' oil operations in May 1981. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> allegedly bought <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> out less than a year later at triple the original investment to improve his chances of getting a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> loan through <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, prosecutors said. The buyback scheme was devised as a way for <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> to clear much of his personal debt and for <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, who was being pursued by creditors over $ 100 million in business loans, to find a new lending source, prosecutors said in closing arguments.

 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of illegally using confidential information to help a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> partnership launch a takeover bid for the company. The suit, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, charges the investment house provided <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> with information acquired while <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> served as <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s financial adviser in prior business deals. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said, `` Although we have not yet seen the lawsuit, we have reviewed the situation and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> believes that no conflict exists in its involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>.'' USG, a leading producer of gypsum and building materials, has been fighting <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' hostile takeover attempts since last October. This week, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> announced a restructuring plan to counter a $ 2.32 billion buyout offer from the partnership, which is headed by oilmen <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. USG's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for what it called a misuse of confidential information in addition to the profits <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> will receive from `` the exploitation of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s confidential business information. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s financial adviser when it acquired <ORGANIZATION> DAP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year and as its selling agent for the $ 59 million in notes <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> issued to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Masonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, the lawsuit said. From both transactions, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> `` obtained confidential, valuable and proprietary information about <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s financial condition and long-term business prospects,'' the suit said. Desert Partners announced last week that <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> is one of its financial advisers and has committed $ 200 million of its own money to assist the proposed takeover of USG. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to be an equity partner with <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> throughout the transaction, obtaining 13.33 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' profit if the takeover is not consummated and gaining a 14.7 percent stake in USG if the deal goes through, according to the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> has paid <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 million in fees and that the investment house will receive an additional $ 4 million when the takeover is completed.

 Bargainers for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> met through the night in attempting to smooth out by today some last-minute snags in a proposed labor contract covering 66,000 autoworkers. Negotiators, who stopped only for meals from Tuesday morning on, had hoped to wrap up the contract by Tuesday night. But by evening, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said they still had to resolve several, unspecified major issues. `` We've got some issues we're both having some difficulties with,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said late Tuesday. `` We're sort of in a holding pattern.'' Nevertheless, union officials said they still expected a settlement today. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said the last-minute snags were a normal part of the bargaining process and would not keep negotiators from working until they reach a settlement. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> spent much of Tuesday meeting with St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials at the so-called `` little big table,'' where they use their authority to settle issues, including contract economics, that ca n't be resolved at lower-level negotiations. The two sides were working to fit an industry-pattern contract established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to the much-smaller <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. The pattern contract already includes 3 percent lump-sum bonus payments instead of wage increases in 1989 and 1990. But negotiators must settle on the amount of funding for a crucial job-protection program. That program requires the company to continue paying workers it otherwise would lay off for any reason other than slow sales, until funding runs out. Workers also were expecting a so-called signing bonus similar to the $ 2,120 they each received for ratifying a three-year agreement in 1985. `` If it does n't include an upfront bonus, that would make ratification difficult at my plant,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danski </PERSON>, president of Local 1264 at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Sterling Heights stamping plant. `` There's all this money flowing out of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> right now, like <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Iacocca </LOCATION> -RRB-'s $ 17.9 million'' in 1987 earnings, <PERSON> Danski </PERSON> said. `` I feel that our workers should get a piece too.'' Under the pattern profit-sharing formula, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers would have received an average of $ 1,800 to $ 2,000 each, union officials said. But unless the money is presented as a signing bonus, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers wo n't get 1987 profit-sharing. Both sides have withdrawn several demands that did n't fit the Ford-GM pattern. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s current three-year contract expires Sept. 14 but would be replaced by a two-year pact as soon as members ratify one. Once the two sides reach a settlement, it must be approved by the 140-member national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council before it can be submitted to the rank-and-file for a vote. The council meeting could occur as soon as Friday if a settlement is reached today. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> announced tentative settlements covering about 7,000 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> workers who were employed by <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought it in August and a local agreement covering 6,500 of them, who work at plants in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. The settlements cleared the way for a final push toward agreement on the national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract, which will cover about 1,200 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> workers after a 5,500-worker assembly in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closes at year's end.

<HEAD>Government To Investigate Kuwaiti's BP Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said today it would investigate the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake in oil giant <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC to determine whether the investment harms the public interest The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said it would refer the acquisition, made by the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government's London-based investment vehicle _ the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> _ to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said `` the implications of BP coming under the influence or control of a government with substantial oil interests and which is a member of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> raised questions of public interest.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and has n't cooperated with the cartel's efforts to control prices via production restraints <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> shares were down about 9 cents to $ 4.99 on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at about midday. The monopolies commission will deliver its report within four months, the trade department said. The investigation does not necessarily reflect a government intention to force the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government to sell any of its stake, but might serve as a warning against further purchases. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which refused to comment on the referral, has said it is only interested in the BP stake as a long-term investment. It has not indicated any plans for a takeover bid. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> told shareholders at their annual meeting that the Kuwaiti stake `` is a higher shareholding than one would wish to see'' and that it created potential uncertainty about the company's future. Oil industry analysts said the government would be breaking new ground in studying the stake. But some discounted the possibility that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would attempt to acquire BP. `` There's just no great takeover story in this,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, an oil industry analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has accrued the stake over the last six months. It began acquiring <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> shares after the government sold off its remaining 31.5 percent stake in the oil company in the fall.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was urged by his friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to get involved in a telecommunications industry issue at a time when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> owned $ 14,000 in regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock, administration sources say. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> subsequently obtained a White House waiver permitting him to make a decision and then approved a reversal of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s previous position, urging a federal judge to lift restrictions that were barring the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies to enter various new types of business. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, whose regional telephone stock holdings and meetings with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> executives have been under criminal investigation, received <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s advice in a memo in mid-December 1986, according to the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the attorney general in a nearly-year-long criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities, said Tuesday he had `` no knowledge that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ever saw or read the memo.'' <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo `` had nothing to do'' with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to seek a White House waiver permitting the attorney general to approve the reversal in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position. The decision to seek the waiver `` was based solely on the advice of the attorney general's staff, out of an abundance of caution,'' said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is now under indictment for alleged racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, in which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> remains under criminal investigation. In addition, it was <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> who got <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> involved in a $ 1 billion <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project which is another part of the ongoing criminal investigation of the attorney general. The independent counsel investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also is examining the $ 40,000-a-year job held by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife and funded by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate family which is leasing space to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. According to the sources, the memo from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division was making major decisions in the telecommunications industry breakup. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said the decisions appeared to be going in the correct direction, but that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should involve himself in the issue, said the sources. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said in the memo that he based his comments on a lunch with `` MH,'' whom the sources identified as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, the former counsel for policy analysis and law at the White House Office of Management and Budget. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday that he was beginning to delve into telephone industry issues as a private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer at the time that he had lunch with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said that he did not recall any details of the lunch but that the two men may have discussed telecommunications issues. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> had joined the firm of <PERSON> Dickstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was `` of counsel'' to the firm, which was analyzing for the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies factual submissions they had made to a consultant, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> was hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help the antitrust division determine whether restrictions on the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies should be lifted. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo refers to the <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> report, said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>. On Jan. 20, 1987, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> obtained a waiver from then-White House counsel <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON> declaring that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his wife's telephone stock holdings were not substantial enough to influence him or to cause the public to question his integrity On Feb. 2, 1987, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approved a reversal in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position and asked a federal judge overseeing the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to lift most of the restrictions on the types of business which the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies could enter. The restrictions included bans on making telephone equipment and providing long-distance and computer services. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been trying to determine whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> may have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws by becoming involved in the issue when he owned stock in the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies. The White House waiver was based partly on incorrect or incomplete information supplied to <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON>'s office by the attorney general's staff. The stock was worth $ 14,000, but the attorney general's staff told <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON>'s staff it was worth $ 9,611. In addition, <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON> was n't told that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> already had met with executives of four of the companies in 1985 and 1986. The executives urged that the restrictions on their companies be lifted. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> says the meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> executives were `` courtesy calls'' which did not constitute substantial involvement by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in the issue.

 Corn and soybean futures prices opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while wheat futures gained slightly. Weather forecasts continue to dominate price movement as soybean planting begins, corn planting advances and the winter wheat crop approaches maturity. Forecasts issued today predicted generally good planting and growing conditions in most crop areas, which tended to depress futures prices, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're seeing a fairly typical spring situation _ scattered showers, a little cooler, generally good conditions for crops that are planted and dry enough for soybean planting,'' he said. <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> attributed the light, early gains in wheat prices to a technical rebound after some fairly significant recent declines. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 2.98 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with May at $ 2.04 \ a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower with May at $ 1.56 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with May at $ 6.86 Cattle futures were mostly lower and pork futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today announced a bankruptcy reorganization plan that calls for no further layoffs or plant closings but includes scaling back steel operations and restructuring the company around existing business units. Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors has already approved the plan, which will be submitted to creditors of the steel-and-aerospace giant for consideration, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy, filed in July 1986, is one of the largest in corporate history. Liabilities total about $ 6 billion and include a $ 2 billion liability to the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditor. Principal components of the reorganized <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> will be a smaller but major steel company concentrating on flat-rolled products, two aerospace-defense operating groups and a streamlined energy products company sized for today's market place, <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` Today's action reflects our commitment to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible with a strong, reorganized company that will be competitive in each of the industries we serve,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` The settlement of claims and the financial restructuring of the company, as proposed in the plan, are major steps in fulfillment of that commitment,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said he doubted the company would emerge from Chapter 11 this year because all creditors would have to agree on the reorganization plan, which would then be submitted to bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy-court protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws gives a beleaguered company a reprieve from creditors while it devises a plan to stay in business and pay its debts. While <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said he anticipated no additional layoffs or plant closings, he noted that the company is studying several cost-cutting options and does not plan to reopen any plant it has already closed. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> has 48,115 employees worldwide. The reorganization plan also includes improving the bar segment of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s steel business, which <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said has been consistently unprofitable. `` This is the most difficult part of the plan since we can not come out of Chapter 11 with any unprofitable businesses,'' he said. Since 1986, more than 35,000 claims have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, although some were thrown out or discovered to be duplicates. That leaves about 32,000 claims to be addressed in the reorganization plan. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> has also been feuding with the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over steel pension plans. The agency took over the plans in 1987 but then turned them back to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, arguing that the company should have to fund them. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> has argued it ca n't afford to do that, and the matter is in court. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said the three <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> pension plans involved will remain terminated in the interim, although he expects the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> to see a `` substantial recovery'' of the money <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> owes it. `` The cost associated with these pension plans was one of the major factors that put <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> into Chapter 11,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` The reduction of costs resulting from their termination is crucial to the company's successful reorganization.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. The names once dominated American retailing, but growing competition from specialty retailers and discount stores keeps challenging the giants to rethink the business they helped create. The way they used to do business _ known as general merchandising _ is n't working anymore. `` It's a very mature industry,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Mature'' means there is little opportunity for growth. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, is retooling its sales strategy and revamping its management structure. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the fourth-largest retailer, already enjoying some success from its shift to apparel, is moving its headquarters from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to cut costs And <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the 11th-largest retailer, is going private just three years after many observers expected it to go out of business. At their height, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> stores numbered in the thousands. Where they had no branches, consumers could buy from their catalogs. But changes in American society affected the way consumers shopped and the way these companies did business. `` The'70s was an era where people went to shopping malls and had more time,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, a consultant with <ORGANIZATION> Loren-Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. In the 1980s, Ms. <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> said, working women have less time to shop and when they need an item, they go to the store where they are most likely to find it. Increasingly, specialty retailers are the place they turn. Ms. <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> cited Toys R Us as a specialty retailer that has taken away business from general merchandisers. `` I know Toys R Us will have the best selection and the price is right,'' she said. `` I know I am going to come out with what I want.'' Home improvement stores such as Home Depot and electronics stores such as <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> also drained business away. `` The specialists were clearly becoming the leaders in the industry,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we did n't begin to specialize, we did n't have much of a chance to survive.'' A further toll was exacted by discount store chains such as K mart and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, which offered name brands at lower prices while general merchandisers sold goods under their own labels. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> was the first to change. In 1983, the company began to move toward specialty retailing by focusing on its clothing lines. It discontinued hardware and automotive items and closed unprofitable stores. The strategy worked. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, in business for 86 years, has seen its profitability improve dramatically. It was do-or-die at <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ward </LOCATION>. In 1985, after years of losses, the retailer closed its catalog operation and weakest stores and eliminated money-losing lines. `` We clearly went to certain categories in which we had consumer acceptance already,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in an interview. The 116-year-old <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> is now a specialty retailer, concentrating on appliances, apparel, automotive items and home furnishings. But <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> _ headed by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, brother of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s chairman _ has been slow to catch on to new trends and has become a follower instead of the industry leader it once was. `` They were the biggest and most powerful, the mostly likely to be bound by tradition than anyone else,'' said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The attitude at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> was, `` This is what <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is, what we've always been and what we'll continue to be,'' he said As a result, the 102-year-old Sears stagnated. The company tried to capitalize on its strong points, starting a chain of paint and hardware stores in 1983. But not until 1987 did <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> begin a push into specialty retailing. Its first steps were through acquiring other retailers, such as Western Auto stores. Now it is experimenting with `` neighborhood stores,'' outlets focusing on specific merchandise lines such as home fashions. In its full-line stores, the company is trying to jazz up its image, teaming with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to market clothing, toys and other merchandise. And while it has sold appliances only under its own Kenmore label, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will now offer brand names, a strategy working for <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also recognizes its internal structure must change. In March, the company announced it would overhaul its staff, reducing the number of management levels and making each part of the business more independent. It also wants to cut its costs, which some analysts call the highest in the business. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> indicated <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has become a giant bureaucracy that has to be more manageable. `` We want to measure everything in a smaller arena,'' he said in an interview. Some analysts are cautiously optimistic <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> can do it. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' plans should increase their market share, but just how sucessful the company will be is `` anybody's guess.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the restructuring would be a difficult process that `` has to go slowly to be careful not to step on any toes'' but that should pay off. More important, <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> `` has to be more responsive to what the consumer wants.'' <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>, was skeptical, noting <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' continuing growth in financial services through its Coldwell Bankers real estate, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> insurance and <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> investment operations. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is a company shifting from a retailer to a financial services company,'' <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON> said. `` That is pretty much what the thrust of the company is.'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, however, is a proven success story. Before <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> became chairman in 1985, the retailer, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was losing money. By transforming itself into a chain of what <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> calls `` value-driven specialty stores,'' it became a profitable and attractive property that found the financial backing to go private. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said his company will continue to develop its specialty format, but he does n't see it branching into other directions. `` We are very comfortable with our structure,'' he said. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> is hoping to reduce its overhead by moving to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The company wo n't say how many managers will relocate, but some reports put the number as low as 15 percent. `` They've done a very expeditious job of replacing -LRB- management -RRB- with qualified people,'' said <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. `` It may be disruptive, but wo n't hurt them long term.'' <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> wo n't fall behind retail trends by being in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, because today's technology, including teleconferencing and satellites, will ease the way, Ms. <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> said, adding, `` You do n't have to be living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to accomplish their goals.

 Department stores have to be special these days to hold on to their share of the retail market. `` They have to offer something that you ca n't find somewhere else,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, a consultant with <ORGANIZATION> Loren-Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Competition from specialty retailers, who have taken business away from general merchandisers like <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, has put big department store owners on the defensive as well Consumers who flocked to a Lazarus or May department store for clothing, electronics and toys often turn now to stores like <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and Toys R Us. As a result, `` department stores as a whole have very, very limited growth potential,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintzer </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Some stores, such as <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Nordstrom </ORGANIZATION>, are perceived as unique with natiowide appeal and therefore can move into new markets and win new customers. Customer service also can set department stores apart from the specialty crowd, but it's been a problem for some companies. Tackling the service issue means more than adding sales help and making merchandise returns easier. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dayton-Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it also may involve changing store layout and appearance. `` The issue of how the store looks and its presentation is important,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, noting that consumers do n't want to buy new clothes in a run-down, drab store. It also means improving the merchandise mix, which today means updating fashion lines so a department store can better compete with specialty apparel retailers. The strategy has worked, but it also has changed the image of the department store industry and moved the stores in the direction of specialty retailing. `` They are purveyors of the current -LRB- fashion -RRB- image,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Department stores have evolved from being true department stores to being what are primarily fashion stores.'' One of the best success stories in department stores is <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, crediting <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, the retailer's chairman, for turning the company around `` <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> came in and made major changes in the Herald Square store, gussied up the first floor ... put in more inventory per square foot,'' the analyst said. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> also revamped the merchandise in all its stores, and in the process won praise as a retailing innovator. Other department store owners also recognize their problems and are trying to resolve them. Crumbling downtown stores are being refurbished, and newer stores in shopping malls are also getting makeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>'s, plans to spend $ 110 million just to renovate the chain's flagship store in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, cited <ORGANIZATION> Dillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, a growing chain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's seventh-largest retailer, as being among the nation's strongest department store owners. `` They have been more flexible with the changing times,'' said <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>. Some department store companies learned too late they should have changed their old-fashioned ways. <PERSON> Gimbel </PERSON>'s failed to keep up with the times and went out of business. Other examples of how not to run a department store company were <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON> said. Both companies' poor use of assets left them vulnerable to takeovers. Associated was bought out by May in 1986 and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is being acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts do n't expect much growth in department stores, but they also do n't foresee trouble for the industry as a whole `` They continue to have a future,'' said <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>. `` But you have to be a strong operator.''

<HEAD>Variety of Retailers Compete For Consumer Dollar</HEAD>

 A consumer in search of a television, tablecloth or jacket has a variety of stores where he can shop. His choice likely will depend on how much he wants to spend, the brand he's looking for and the time he has available The options include specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, general merchandisers and hypermarkets. Analysts point out that the distinctions among retailers are becoming more and more blurred. For example, department stores have taken on a more specialized slant by concentrating on apparel, and supermarkets are selling more general merchandise. These are the major categories of retailers and the markets they serve: _ SPECIALTY STORES These concentrate on a specific type of product, such as apparel, home improvement items or toys. They can be independent stores or part of a chain such as Gap, Home Depot, Toys R Us and <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoe </PERSON>. Specialty stores appeal to consumers because they offer a wide selection of items within one category of merchandise. They're also smaller than other retailers and less time-consuming to shop. Some specialty retailers, in particular fashion stores, offer a certain image that a consumer may be looking for. _ DISCOUNT STORES These offer a variety of merchandise categories, including national brands, at lower prices. They offer the convenience of one-stop shopping and one-stop checkouts. Discount stores include chains such as <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, K mart, Venture and Target. _ HYPERMARKETS Such stores as <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hypermart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> offer the same merchandise as discount stores, plus a full-line supermarket, giving consumers lower prices and the convenience of one-stop shopping. _ DEPARTMENT STORES Modern-day department stores generally serve the moderate-to-upper end of the market, offering several categories of merchandise with an emphasis on apparel and home furnishings. They appeal to the consumer through their increasingly upscale image and ambiance and by offering more services than other retailers. They also offer one-stop shopping. _ GENERAL MERCHANDISERS Operations such as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, like department stores, offer a broad range of merchandise. They emphasize their own labels, although national brands are making their way into the selection. Their apparel lines tend to be at the lower-to-moderate end of the market. _ MASS MERCHANDISERS Stores such as those operated by <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> also offer a range of merchandise, generally at the lower end of the scale. They offer the convenience of one-stop shopping and lower prices.

<HEAD>Tenneco Boosts Quarterly Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> profits jumped by 117 percent in the first three months of 1988, boosted mainly by a one-time $ 25 million foreign tax credit, the company announced Wednesday. For the quarter ending March 30, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> recorded profits of $ 63 million, or 38 cents per share, on revenues of $ 4 billion compared with earnings of $ 29 million, or 8 cents per share, on $ 3.6 billion in sales during the same period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s energy businesses had first-quarter operating income of $ 205 million, compared with operating income for the 1987 quarter of $ 169 million. Despite lower domestic crude oil volumes and prices, and lower natural gas volumes, exploration and production operating results improved from the first quarter of 1987, the company said. Officials attributed the gain to higher natural gas prices, improved international crude oil prices and volumes, and a benefit for the reversal of excess prior years' windfall profit tax expense. The company's industrial businesses had first quarter operating income of $ 69 million compared with $ 87 million for the first quarter of last year. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had first quarter operating earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> had lower earnings largely due to a shift of lower-margin contracts. Retail sales of farm equipment were much stronger in the first quarter of 1988 for Case IH and the industry, indicating an upturn in that business after nine years of decline. But Case IH posted a larger first quarter operating loss than in 1987. The first quarter earnings included a one-time $ 25 million tax credit for foreign taxes relating to <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> oil operations.

<HEAD>Has Airline Deregulation Improved Highway Safety?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 According to a university study, the evidence is quite strong: Airline deregulation has led to improvements in highway safety. No, the study does n't refer to highways of the air, as the air lanes sometimes are called; the reference is to what most people think of when they read the word `` highway,'' that is, a road on the surface of the earth. The improvements, say two scholars, are significant: 1,700 lives saved, 665,000 fewer accidents, a reduction of 66,000 in the number of injuries and a $ 1.9 billion saving over what would have been lost without deregulation. The authors, two <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economists, say deregulation of the airlines since 1978 has not only changed air travel patterns but the pattern of highway travel as well. Most importantly, it has spurred travelers to use safer sky routes rather than more dangerous surface transportation, say <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> in their study for the Center for the Study of American Business. The two professors concede air deregulation also might have reduced air safety and slowed the long-run decline in air deaths. But they say it is almost incontrovertible that the shift to air did indeed make highways safer. Their conclusions are based primarily on two broad observations: 1. After 1978 there was a marked `` structural'' decrease in the growth of ground travel that was unrelated to changes in a range of factors that normally affect driving, such as cost, income, population and permissible road speed. Between 1979 and 1985, the time in which the statistical improvements were compiled, annual passenger-car travel appears to have droped an average of 3.9 percent below what might have been expected. This and other evidence, they say, `` convinces us that deregulation played a major role in lowering the growth in automotive travel.'' 2. Relating the reduced surface miles to the rate and cost of accidents per mile you come up with the statistics cited earlier. If they seem overly large, the author's suggest you cut them in half; what remains is still substantial. The authors observe that the calculations were more involved and scientific than these points might suggest. For example, air deregulation induced many people to fly rather than drive; but it might have caused more driving, too. Deregulation, they explain, seems to have induced additional air-miles to be flown by travelers who otherwise would n't have taken as many trips. And this added air travel might have meant more ground travel to get to airports. Secondly, greater efficiency in the airline industry due to deregulation may have marginally increased national income and, therefore, may have led to a greater demand for ground travel as well as air travel. Such considerations give you an idea of how involved the study became, but there were other things to measure as well. For example, deregulation reduced air service to small rural airports, forcing travelers to drive instead of fly. Moreover, the measurements were made more complex by the fact that aircraft generally are flown in a more direct path to their goal than automobiles are driven to theirs. While the authors agree that other scholars might quibble with the specifics, such as the number of dollars saved, they stand firm behind their general conclusion that air deregulation has reduced ground-travel accidents. From this conclusion they distill a warning: `` Reregulation of the airline industry could drive some air travelers back to the nation's roads and could increase ground-travel accidents, injuries, deaths and economic losses.''

<HEAD>Desert Partners Increases Proposal for USG</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> today unveiled new proposals in its pursuit to acquire <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that value the company at about $ 2.58 billion in an attempt to top <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s own restructuring plan. Under one scenario proposed to <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s board, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> would pay $ 39 in cash, $ 9 in bonds and offer stock in a new company for each of the Chicago-based company's outstanding shares. Wall Street sources have valued the offer at about $ 50 a share, giving the deal an indicated value of $ 2.58 billion. Under another scenario, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> would pay $ 50-a-share in cash for 72 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 51.5 million outstanding shares. The remaining shares would be exchanged for bonds and stock in the new company `` for the same aggregate amount,'' <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. USG has been fighting a takeover for months. On Monday the building products manufacturer proposed a $ 2.2 billion recapitalization plan that would pay shareholders cash and notes. The company noted that it would have to sell off its <ORGANIZATION> Msonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Kinkead </LOCATION> businesses to finance the restructuring. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' chief financial officer, called his company's proposals `` clearly superior'' to the recapitlization plan. The new proposals come less than a week after <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 45 a share if the two companies could negotiate a friendly deal. Desert Partners, led by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, is offering $ 42 a share in a hostile tender offer. That bid, including debt securities and warrants valued at $ 42 each, has a value of about $ 2.2 billion and remains in effect. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> owns about 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s shares and said that as of last Friday about 19.3 million shares, or 37.5 percent, had been tendered under its $ 42-a-share offer.

<HEAD>Brazil Prepares To Return to IMF After Three-Year Hiatus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN LEHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, strapped with the Third World's largest foreign debt, has subdued its nationalistic rhetoric and is preparing to resume negotiations for financial help from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moura </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s press spokesman, said Tuesday that an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> mission was expected to arrive Monday in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, to start negotiating an 18-month standby loan of $ 700 million. The talks end a three-year chill in relations between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, which was widely seen here as the epitome of foreign intransigence and meddling in this country's internal affairs. `` Before the end of July, the agreement will be signed and relations between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will have been formally re-established,'' <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> said. He said the $ 700 million would help <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which owes $ 121 billion to foreign creditors, to close this year's balance of payments. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> stopped negotiating with the Fund in 1985. Critics said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed cure for the economy was recessionary, and nationalists protested that the agency's monitoring of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s economic performance was an affront to the country's sovereignty Then-Finance Minister <PERSON> Dilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Funaro </PERSON> said this country would never again submit an econmic plan for the Fund's approval. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> would set its own goals, he said, and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> could take them or leave them. But <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s independent stance made foreign bankers balk at lending this country more money. And when the government in early 1987 suspended interest payments on about $ 70 billion owed to private banks, debt rescheduling talks came to a near standstill. But late last year <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> started to pay back some of the interest due, and in January Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said the government would negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> `` an accord that will be of interest to the country.'' In March, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and its private creditors reached a preliminary agreement to reschedule over 20 years most of what this country owes through 1993. <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> said only some legal details still had to be worked out and that the accord should be signed in June or July. According to <PERSON> Moura </PERSON>, the outcome of the new negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will depend on an agreement on an acceptable size for the government spending deficit. The government has said that this year the deficit will be cut to 4 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Gross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> and to 2 percent in 1989. The deficit now stands at about 6 percent of the GNP, estimated roughly at $ 300 billion. <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> denied reports that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> was pressuring the government to slash its deficit to zero. `` That's something <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will never be able to accomplish,'' he said. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> wants is to see a downward trend in the deficit, and this we are doing through the recent austerity measures,'' he added. In April, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> announced deficit-cutting measures that included a two-month wage freeze for government workers, a limit on the number of jobs public employees can hold, tax increases, financial incentives for early retirement or voluntary resignation, and an end to federal wheat subsidies. The most important benefit of the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> said, will be `` the reopening of credit lines from the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' as the group of Western government lenders is called. He said these credit lines would help finance Brazilian imports of foreign machinery and other equipment needed `` to modernize our industrial park.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> accord `` has nothing to do with the debt renegotiation agreement'' worked out with private creditor banks. `` The fact that both should be signed at about the same time is coincidental, although it is obvious that an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will make private creditors breathe easier,'' <PERSON> Moura </PERSON> said. The agreement with the private creditor banks includes: a $ 5.8 billion loan to help pay part of the interest due in 1987, 1988 and 1989; the rescheduling, over 20 years with an eight-year grace period, of almost $ 64 billion in interest and principal due through 1993, and spreads -LRB- the extra interest banks charge high risk clients -RRB- of 0.8125 percent, down from the 1.66 percent <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> now pays. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which has not paid any of the principal it owes since 1982, has knocked off almost $ 400 million from its debt in debt-for-equity swaps held in auctions at the Rio and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> stock exchanges in March and April. Through these swaps, creditor banks can exchange, at a discount, part of what <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> owes them in investments in Brazilian firms.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose Wednesday against all major currencies in listless European trading, bolstered by expectations of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s biggest private fortune was built on a better milk carton, according to a new survey of wealth in a country that discourages high incomes. The survey, published Wednesday by <PERSON> Affarsvarlden </PERSON> -LRB- Business World -RRB-, showed the four wealthiest families have left <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and relocated their companies abroad to avoid a tax system designed to equalize personal income. However, the magazine said its list of multimillionaires has grown from 26 to 163 since its first survey six years ago. Thirty-one families were listed as having assets worth more than one billion kronor. Three families would qualify as billionaires in dollars. A dollar is worth just under six krona. The wealthiest family is headed by <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausing </PERSON>, the sons of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousing </PERSON> who began producing milk cartons in 1952, and in 1963 gave the world a flat-topped carton that can be packed and shipped like bricks. <PERSON> Tetra </PERSON> <PERSON> Pak </PERSON>, the company at the base of the family fortune, has its head office in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The Rousing brothers, said the magazine, are worth up to 30 billion kronor, or $ 5 billion. Second on the list is the family of <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamprad </PERSON> who founded <ORGANIZATION> IKEA </ORGANIZATION>, a chain store selling cheap do-it-yourself furniture and accessories. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s best known industrial family, ranked 64th on the list. One distant relative was <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, the diplomat who saved 100.000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi extermination camps during World War II. He was arrested by the Soviet army during final days of the war and disappeared. King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> just squeezed onto the list in 158th place with estimated assets of about 100 million kronor, or $ 16.6 million. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s newest billionaire is <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Arwidsson </PERSON>, 35, who took a small loan from a bank eight years ago and parlayed it into a fortune on the stock market, the magazine said. He was 31st on the list. Senior Editor <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzon </PERSON> said the list was difficult to compile fairly. `` We tried to evaluate the market value of the family holdings in listed companies,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The situation is a little tricky. We are talking about family equity because we do n't care if the owner has transferred some or all of his shares to one son or five sons ... for tax purposes,'' said <PERSON> Franzon </PERSON>. Most Swedes pay about half their wages in taxes, and the marginal tax rate on top income brackets goes up to 75 percent. Inheritance tax can amount to 100 percent, and even more, of an estate. <PERSON> Franzon </PERSON> said the magazine's first survey of the super-rich was in 1982 when the Social Democrats, who ran <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for 50 years, were returned to power after six years of non-socialist government. The quantum leap in the length of the list was only partly due to the government's economic policy, he said. That policy encourages business profits while heavily taxing private income. Employee benefits and tax-financed government welfare programs give Swedish workers one of the world's highest standards of living. The growing number of millionaires could be attributed to a real estate and stock market boom, despite the crash last October, and by inflation, which pushed up the nominal value of the companies, <PERSON> Franzon </PERSON> said. He acknowledged his earlier list was not as accurate as it should have been. `` I'm a little ashamed to say that our journalism also is better. We have better resources ... and a better understanding of the companies,'' he said. `` We have 40 or 50 people on the list this time who should have been on before, but it was n't possible to find them,'' the editor added. <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ax </PERSON>: son-Johnson, 45, is the only woman listed as head of a wealthy family, with assets of up to 2.4 billion kronor, or $ 400 million. She spells her name in a disappearing form of Swedish abreviation, but the company she inherited is known as <ORGANIZATION> Axelson-Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, a trading and investment firm which last month <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest department store chain to its holdings. <PERSON> Franzon </PERSON> said the list is still incomplete, and the magazine has more to learn. `` My guess is that an accurate list should have many more real estate people,'' he said. <PERSON> Affarsvarlden </PERSON>, a weekly first published in 1901, has a circulation of 25,000.

<HEAD>Japan Retreats On Farm, Computer Chip Trade Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> retreated Wednesday in two trade disputes, agreeing to arbitration over its restrictions on farm imports and accepting a finding it violated world trading rules with its pricing policies for computer chip exports. Dropping its long-standing resistance on the farm issue, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it would submit to arbitration on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaint about its import quotas on beef, oranges and orange juice. An international panel under the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will study and rule on the complaint. The renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for a probe followed three weeks of unsuccessful settlement talks with Japanese officials, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. The restrictions are causing `` substantial harm'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, with up to $ 1 billion in lost trade possibly at stake, he said. Japanese delegate <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatano </PERSON> accepted the probe at a regular meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and said his country also will allow consideration of a separate Australian complaint over the beef quotas. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, officials of both nations said they still hope to resolve the beef and citrus issue in two-way negotations in spite of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> proceedings. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> also approved a panel report ruling that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> violated <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules in the way it implemented part of a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor trade pact. The report found in favor of a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> complaint, which effectively charged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> illegally tried to rig the cost of certain types of computer chips in third markets through an international price monitoring system. <PERSON> Hatano </PERSON> pledged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will take `` appropriate measures as soon as possible'' to comply with the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> ruling, but did not elaborate. The council of the 96-nation trade pact and agency traditionally makes decisions by consensus, so <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had the power to block action on the farm or computer chips matters if it had chosen to. Delegates from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, both Southeast Asian semiconductor producers, welcomed the report's adoption and urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to take action. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pressured <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> into the pact after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers complained Japanese companies sold computer chips below cost in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last month, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> blocked formation of a panel on beef and citrus imports at a special U.S.-requested council session, prompting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to threaten retaliation. Australian envoy <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON> said his country, once was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main beef supplier, has seen its share of imports drop from 74 percent in 1976 to 41 percent last year _ while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share rose to 39 percent from 13 percent In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> blocked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaint against <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> subsidies to promote processors and producers of oilseeds and similar animal feed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had sought a panel to investigate its charge that the 12-nation bloc's policies are illegally cutting into long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean exports to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which have been duty-free under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> since 1962.

<HEAD>Eastern Cancels Orion Pilot Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has canceled its contract with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to provide strike-replacement pilots, but pledged to remain flying in the event of labor troubles. Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union on its expiring labor pact, had contracted with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> in case its own pilots refused to cross picket lines, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled in March that the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> violated the existing contract between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its pilots union. Replacements can not be trained until a strike begins, the judge said. <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, is one of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> filed a similar suit in April, accusing Eastern of using its planes to train <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants to break a strike. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion contract to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s legal setbacks, however. The contract was terminated `` for sound business reasons,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. `` Beyond that I ca n't elaborate.'' The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the spokeswoman said. `` We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,'' she said. `` But our first priority is still reaching a settlement'' with the Machinists. <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pilots union at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said the federal court decisions against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> left the carrier with no choice. `` This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey court orders,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. `` The judge said you can not train -LRB- replacement -RRB- pilots in any capacity until such time as there is a strike.'' The cancellation will cost <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> about $ 5.5 million under a provision of the <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> contract, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> refused to comment on any provisions of the contract or its cancellation.

 The chairman of takeover target <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday called on the government to block foreign raids of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s confectionery companies, which have been dubbed the candy bar wars. <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadbury </PERSON> told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that the British confectionery industry has been in turmoil since U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it planned to increase its 17.7 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>, possibly through a tender offer.

But <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> SA, <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s rival in the battle for <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, said its stake in the British candy maker has been boosted to 23.5 percent The raids on <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>, both major players in the world confection market, have sparked an uproar in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> said the government should not allow the stock market to decide the fate of the companies. `` There are a number of public interest issues involved, which it is for the government rather than the market to take into account,'' he said. He stressed that the two Swiss companies were protected from hostile bids in their own country while they were free to try to acquire British companies. Both <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> represent `` generations of patient British investment, and they are appreciating assets. So where the returns from them are to flow in the future is an issue of national significance,'' he added. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> has not directly appealed to the government for intervention but is discussing the matter with `` one or two people,'' said a company spokesman who asked not to be identified.

 While declining to say whether <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has become a possible takeover target, the company's chairman told shareholders Wednesday that management will fight to keep the computer maker independent. `` I have great confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> management to pursue the vital task of enhancing shareholder value,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Bloomington-based <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will fight to remain an independent company.'' Price met with shareholders Wednesday for the company's annual meeting. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had bought a stake in the company and may be considering a bid for it. At a news conference after the shareholders' meeting, Price refused comment on whether a takeover attempt of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> is under way. `` We do n't comment on speculation and rumors,'' Price said. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $ 1.75 a share on Tuesday and was up another 50 cents a share at $ 27.12 -LCB- a share shortly before the close of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. The report of a possible takeover bid by the <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> family is the latest in a series of takeover and break-up rumors that have come since <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> reported total losses of $ 832 million in 1985 and 1986. Net earnings in 1987 were $ 19.3 million, or 45 cents a share, and Price said the company is still in the midst of a turnaround. Despite a projection in <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 annual report that the company will have a negative cash flow through most of 1988, Price said Wednesday `` there is some good news in each of our major areas.'' He said the company continues to see profit margin improvements in its data storage division, where new disk drive products were introduced in 1987. The division suffered serious setbacks in 1985 and 1986. Cash flow will be held down in 1988 because the company needs to keep spending money on improvements in data storage and other divisions, including supercomputer subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, Price said. `` You ca n't do these things without spending money,'' Price said. `` We have to be able to invest in the businesses we have pursued.'' Price also said he is comfortable with the size of the company's debt load, which is between $ 450 million and $ 500 million <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON>, the company's chief financial officer, said the terms on the debt could be better. But he said the company's debt-to-equity ratio improved to 42 percent at the end of 1987 from 56 percent the year before

<HEAD>LTV Discloses Bankruptcy Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly two years after seeking federal bankruptcy protection, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unveiled a reorganization plan that keeps the steel-aerospace giant largely intact but scales back its steel operations. The reorganization plan envisions no further layoffs or plant closings, although it includes restructuring the company around existing business units. Chairman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s principal components will be a down-sized steel company concentrating on flat-rolled products, two aerospace and defense operating groups and a streamlined energy products division. The plan, approved by <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, will be submitted to creditors for consideration, <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who had given the company a May 20 deadline for the proposal, must also agree on the proposal. `` It has been our commitment from the beginning to emerge from Chapter 11 as quickly as possible with a strong, reorganized company that will be competitive in each of the industries we serve,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws in July 1986, one of the largest filings in corporate history. Liabilities total about $ 6 billion and include a $ 2 billion claim by the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditor. The reorganization hinges on three <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> pension plans, terminated by the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> in early 1987. The agency took over the plans but then turned them back to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, arguing that the company should fund them. The dispute is now in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court, but <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said the company is confident it will prevail. `` It is our contention that <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> did not have the ability to fund these pension plans when they were terminated, and it does not have the ability now,'' he said. `` The cost associated with them was one of the major factors that put us into Chapter 11,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` And the reduction of costs resulting from their termination is crucial to the company's successful reorganization. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said he expected the company, which employs 48,115 workers worldwide, to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings some time next year. `` The thing that delayed our ability to come out as soon as we had hoped to was the issue with the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. And that has pretty much slowed everything down,'' he said Sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> the reorganization plan is likely to be revised during court negotiations, and that it could offer creditors no more than 30 cents on the dollar, mainly as an equity stake in the company. <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said several years of weakness in <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s steel and energy businesses, along with operating and liquidity problems that developed in mid-1986, caused the company to seek bankruptcy protection. But, he said, the company's steel operations were more efficient than two years ago, aerospace and defense sectors were restructured to `` sharpen the focus of on our principal lines of business'' and energy operations were scaled down. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, predicted <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> will succeed. `` If you have a company with a substantial amount of revenues related to aircraft, with fewer and fewer new military programs coming on line, then these guys will have to redirect their future somewhere,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dozen Major Companies Endorse Computer Communication Standards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dozen companies that represent more than 80 percent of the nation's computer and communications sales joined Wednesday to endorse a set of standards that will some day allow effortless communication between computers of different designs. The companies committed themselves to following Open Systems Interconnect standards because of strong pressure from customers, who are tired of computers that ca n't easily talk to each other. The federal government, the nation's biggest computer customer, has warned computer makers that starting two years from now it will not buy any equipment that does not follow the Open Systems Interconnect standard, except by special waiver. Many big computer makers have been cautious about embracing standards, fearing they will lose their loyal customers once it becomes easy to mix and match computers from different suppliers. Wednesday's new conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was a demonstration that the companies feel they have more to lose by rejecting standards than by embracing them. `` This is an epochal event, and it's all customer-driven. That's what's so extraordinary,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fram </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co The 12 companies will demonstrate products that follow the Open Systems Interconnect standard at a trade show in June in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Showcased will be products for electronic mail and file transfer. All major computer makers already offer ways to do those jobs, but at the show they will demonstrate how they can do them in compatible ways. `` OSI has left the drawing boards,'' said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Faurer </PERSON>, president and chief executive of the <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, Va.-based Corporation for Open Systems, which brought the companies together. The dozen companies represented were <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Telenet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Standards save money, said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>, a former chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, who was invited to speak at the news conference <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cut the frequency of downtime in half and the length of downtime episodes to 5 minutes from 15 minutes when it put a standards-based manufacturing system into its truck and bus plant in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>, who is at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expects to save 15 to 80 percent off the cost of its antiquated, $ 800 million-a-year communications system when it builds a new one that is based on Open Systems Interconnect standards, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> computer expert.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has accused <ORGANIZATION> Endotronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of reporting millions of dollars of phony sales between 1985 and 1987 in violation of security laws. In charges filed Tuesday in federal court in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also accuses the Coon Rapids-based biotechnology company of filing false reports with the government and covering up that the company's founders, <PERSON> Micheal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruenberg </PERSON>, were secretly financing the sale of its instruments to foreign customers. In a simultaneous filing, Endotronics, while neither admitting nor denying the charges, agreed to a permanent injunction barring it from such actions in the future, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We merely have agreed to manage the business professionally and in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> rules and the law,'' <PERSON> Monis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuster </PERSON>, general counsel for Endotronics, said Wednesday. `` We have clean hands,'' she said, adding that the allegations stem from the company's previous management. The injunction, if approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>, would close the book on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of <LOCATION> Endotronics </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, chief of enforcement in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office, which conducted the investigation She said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must decide if criminal charges will be filed. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakowicz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Endotronics </PERSON>' current president, said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, called a consent decree, does not call for any fine against the company. It is significant because it marks the end of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, which current management has cooperated with, <PERSON> Sakowicz </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have been investigating Endotronics, which makes machines for use in genetic engineering, for more than a year. The company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code last year after the investigations were disclosed. The disclosure came during a highly publicized effort by the company to get the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to free $ 24 million in taconite production tax funds for economic development on the Iron Range. The company said it wanted the money for research which it said could lead to a plant in <LOCATION> Hibbing </LOCATION>. Endotronics has since emerged from bankruptcy under new management. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, in its first formal charges against Endotronics, alleges that founders <PERSON> Micheal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruenberg </PERSON> supplied at least $ 5.9 million of their own money to pay for machines that supposedly had been sold to customers. The Gruenbergs and other company officials have been sued by a group of shareholders who allege the officials faked sales to inflate the company's stock price and defraud investors. Endotronics stock peaked at $ 35.50 in August 1986, before falling to less than $ 1 last year. The stock closed at $ 1.62 -LCB- Wednesday on the over-the-counter market, down 25 cents a share. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said at least $ 3.4 million of the company's sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were false, because the customers had no firm obligation to pay for them. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruenberg </PERSON>, former chairman and cofounder of Endotronics, declined to comment. He and his son, <PERSON> Micheal </PERSON>, former president of the company, resigned last year.

 The dollar was mixed against key currencies Wednesday in light domestic trading, which dealers attributed to a lack of economic news. Gold prices rose slightly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after falling in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 444.40 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 443.25 Tuesday. Currency brokers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said there was little to influence the dollar's behavior, so the currency rose or fell marginally based on short-term trading strategies. `` We're just sitting here in a very narrow range,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohorst </PERSON>, managing director of foreign exchange trading for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some traders said the dollar was mildly affected by conflicting speculation about the the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s impending report on April unemployment, due Friday. Stronger employment figures would imply greater demand for imports and higher inflation, which would erode the dollar's value. Conversely, weaker employment figures could help ease fears of inflation and boost the dollar. Currency markets were closed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a national holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 124.95 Japanese yen from 124.83 yen late Tuesday. But later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 124.68 yen, down from 125.15 late Tuesday. The British pound fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.8650 from $ 1.8715. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.8652, less valuable than $ 1.8683 on Tuesday.

 Oil futures prices slipped lower Wednesday, pressured by a continuing negative mood in the market and a report that showed larger-than-expected domestic inventories in gasoline and crude. June contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, fell 17 cents per 42-gallon barrel to close at $ 17.20 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded gasoline lost 0.56 cent per gallon, settling at 49.72 cents, while wholesale heating oil dropped 0.57 cent to 46.20 cents per gallon. In a weekly report issued after the market's close Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based trade organization, said gasoline supplies jumped 5.9 million barrels in the week ended April 29, while crude stocks were down by 700,000 barrels.

The figures put downward pressure on prices because they indicated continuing abundant supplies for existing demand. Ms. <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> also said the market remained depressed by a perception that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be unable to agree on a way tighten up its production, even when it meets next month in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. In addition, she said technical factors contributed to the day's slumping prices

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Pressured By Breakdown Of Japan Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A breakdown in talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over Japanese restrictions on imports of beef and oranges helped push live cattle futures prices lower Wednesday. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s downward revision of its March cattle slaughter estimate would likely become a negative factor in Thursday's trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On other exchanges Wednesday, grain futures advanced while soybeans retreated; precious metals were higher; energy futures were lower and stock-index futures fell. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s approval, had asked an international trade panel to settle the beef-and-oranges dispute. It was the second collapse in the negotiations since late March, when a four-year agreement on Japanese beef and citrus import quotas expired. `` The cattle market ... came under pressure during the day as it appeared there would not be an agreement reached between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a livestock analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Despite the market activity, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said beef trade with the Japanese accounts for a very small share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle market. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday afternoon it had overestimated the number of cattle slaughtered in March by 44,000 head and revised that number accordingly. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the revision was `` nothing but bearish on the cattle futures.'' The correction should help clear up industry concerns over discrepancies between <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> daily estimated slaughter totals and the weekly actual figures. Feeder cattle futures finished mixed while pork futures advanced on ideas that hog slaughters have passed a seasonal peak, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to .03 cent higher with the contract for delivery in June at 71.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .40 cent higher with May at 79.55 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent to .95 cent higher with June at 50.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to .23 cent higher with May at 51.17 cents a pound. Grain futures settled mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while soybeans posted modest losses. Activity in both soybeans and corn, which showed only the slightest improvement, was primarily influenced by forecasts for favorable planting and growing weather, analysts said. Longer-range forecasts indicated conditions also would favor soybean planting when it begins in earnest next week. Wheat and oat prices rebounded after four straight days of losses as traders hunted for bargains. Wheat settled 1 cent to 3 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 3.01 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.05 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with May at $ 1.60 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 5 cents lower with May at $ 6.84 \ a Gold and silver futures posted slight gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in reaction to the dollar's weakness against the Japanese yen, analysts said. For the second day in a row, gold futures did not follow crude oil futures, which finished slightly lower. Inflation-sensitive precious metal prices often follow oil prices closely. Gold settled $ 1.50 to $ 1.60 higher with June at $ 446.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.9 cents higher with May at $ 6.327 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices slipped lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report showing larger-than-expected domestic inventories of gasoline and crude, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents lower to 5 cents higher with June at $ 17.20 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent to .57 cent lower with June at 46.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent to .56 cent lower with June 49.72 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.85 points lower at 259.85.

 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its first-quarter net profit rose 2 percent over a year ago, aided by improvement in its Spanish and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> operations. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest automaker said quarterly net income increased to 144 million marks, or about $ 84 million, from 141 million marks in the same period in 1987.

Company officials said the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations will post another loss in 1988 because the underused plant in <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, will not be shut down until July.

 <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, according to an announcement from the troubled toy maker. The company's board of directors named <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> as chairman and chief executive and promote <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> to the board, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> will continue as president and chief operating officer while <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> will remain as a consultant and a director of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>, the statement said. `` It is necessary to intensify and accelerate cost cutting actions already begun and to further contract the size of the company,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said in the statement. He also said `` financially directed leadership is desirable during this period, and I believe <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, working together with ... <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> can accomplish these critical objectives.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>, which once rode high on the success of its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and other toys, was hit by declining sales in recent years, along with other major toy manufacturers. The toymaker posed losses of $ 105.4 million in 1987 and $ 111.2 million in 1986. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 330 employees at manufacturing and distribution facilities, mainly at <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s three manufacturing plants in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, area. The company also laid off about 145 members, or 35 percent, of its corporate staff. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> attempted in March to cut its $ 335 million debt by more than one half by exchanging four separate issues of debt securities for a combination of new debt and common stock. The company said that move was the next-to-last step before a possible filing for federal bankruptcy protection from creditors. But reception to the plan has been cool, and <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> last week for the second time extended the deadline for holders of debentures to agree to the proposal. The new deadline is Friday, May 13.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moved to erase <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil provisions of the trade bill Wednesday and sent the plan to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in what sponsors called a compromise gesture designed to head off a threatened presidential veto. `` By this action we are offering to meet the president half way by taking care of one of the two items to which he has expressed disapproval in this ... legislation,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure 253-159. It now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> which could take it up as early as next week, although it is not clear when it will do so. The technical-corrections resolution amends the 1,000-page trade bill passed last week. The resolution itself would not go to the president's desk, but merely instruct a clerk to delete the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions before the trade bill is sent to the White House. Republicans complained that reopening the trade bill after it already had been passed was a violation of House rules. `` You've come the wrong half and you've done it the wrong way,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. `` When it's over, it's over. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been expressing concern about a provision of the trade bill that would require companies with 100 or more employees to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Democrats said they wanted to compromise but ruled out deleting the plant-closings provision. They said it was needed by blue-collar workers whose lives are disrupted when they find themselves out of work without warning. `` Maybe they should consult their astrologer to find out when they are going to be out of work,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. More recently, the president has been critical of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil provisions. One of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions would clear the way for export of 50,000 barrels of crude daily to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, but first require shipment of the oil in an American vessel to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> port. It is a favorite feature of politically influential maritime unions and a similar provision appears in the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in January. The other provision would permit export of 70,000 barrels daily of petroleum products from the refinery at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and any new refineries that are constructed in the state. Republicans have been complaining that it violates accepted procedures to reach back and alter the bill after floor action is complete. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said bills have gotten similar handling at least five times in the last three years and that it falls within proper bounds. `` Now we again call upon President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to demonstrate reciprocal good faith and reconsider his oft-repeated threat to veto the trade bill because of the socially responsible provision regarding worker notification,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acknowledged that dropping the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> provisions was partly aimed at picking up two votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a possible veto override. The measure cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 63-36, last week _ short of the two-thirds margin needed to override a veto. Both of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, opposed the bill Critics of administration trade policy said the Alaskans would have supported the bill if the export curbs had been deleted. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, however, said he could not guarantee that he would vote for the measure, even if the restrictions were stripped from it.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to pay $ 11.5 million to a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> woman left a quadriplegic after a 1984 rollover accident involving a Jeep. In return for the settlement, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 34, agreed not to pursue her claim for punitive damages. The settlement included $ 9.5 million awarded by a jury in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> on April 1, 1986, plus interest. The same jury awarded Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> $ 10 million in punitive damages, but that amount was reduced to $ 1 by the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. However, the appellate jury recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review the punitive award, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON>, one of Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s lawyers. <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON> said he had intended to seek the original $ 10 million in punitive damages before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who now is a nursing home patient, was riding in a Jeep CJ7 on May 4, 1984, when it was struck by a car. She was thrown from the Jeep, which then rolled onto her, and suffered a broken neck. The driver of the car, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, earlier had agreed to a $ 600,000 settlement with Ms. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON> said experts convinced the jury that the Jeep's center of gravity was too high, making it susceptible to rollover accidents.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reached a tentative settlement Wednesday on a two-year national labor contract, following about 40 hours of non-stop bargaining. `` We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve, and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>,'' the union said in a statement attributed to <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> began negotiating April 18 on a contract to replace a three-year pact covering 66,000 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers in 15 states, which expires in September. The proposed national labor pact _ which includes a $ 1,000 a worker signing bonus _ will be presented Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s 140-member national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council for approval It will be submitted to the rank-and-file for a ratification vote sometime next week. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s chief bargainer, called the tentative agreement `` affordable and equitable'' and said the signing bonus was `` in recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s contribution to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s productivity and profits during the past few years.'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> told a news conference that the $ 1,000 signing bonus, when added to a $ 500 bonus <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers received in March, would equal the amount workers would have received in profit-sharing payments if the profit-sharing formula in the new contract had been in effect last year. Negotiators adapted to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> an industry-pattern contract established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies to keep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for any reason except slow sales _ until funding for the program runs out. It also requires hiring of one worker for every two who leave the company. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will fund its program with $ 230 million. The pattern also provides lump sum payments of 3 percent in the next two years and includes the profit-sharing formula that has paid thousands of dollars to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers over the past few years. The pattern also forbids plant closings over the life of the contract except for those closings announced before negotiations began. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> contract, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract includes the company's commitment that executives will receive neither cash nor stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula produces no payout for workers. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said that did not prevent executives from exercising stock options granted in previous years. The contract also includes the union leadership's commitment to encourage its local unions to consider accepting so-called Modern Operating Agreements _ Japanese-style agreements in which workers are organized into teams. The new contract will expire Sept. 14, 1990, meaning <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will negotiate its next new contract at the same time as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in a decade. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> agreed to early talks in March in an effort to ease growing labor-management friction. Problems stemmed partly from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s January announcement that it would close a 5,500-worker former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant _ a sudden reversal of promises that the plant would run five more years _ and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s aborted attempt to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> backed down from the <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale, but the early negotiations were threatened by outrage among the rank and file over the April 19 disclosure of 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executive wages, including Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s $ 17.9 million. That was followed by confirmation a few days later of the company's plans to shift K-car production to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in July. Uproar over the those developments, plus <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to restrict when workers could retire with full benefits, almost prompted the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> to break off negotiations until August. But following a brief <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> boycott of the talks, the company backed off on those issues. The two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separate but related contracts covering about 7,000 former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, clearing the way for settlement of the national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> issues had to be settled before the national contract in part because the national pact will cover workers left on the job after the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant closes.
