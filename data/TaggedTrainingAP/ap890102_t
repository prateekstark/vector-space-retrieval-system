 The jury is still out on <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but history is likely to regard him as an average to good president, according to some scholars of the presidency. With little time left in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final term, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists in history, political science and social psychology. Their tentative verdict: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will get high marks for his use of the White House pulpit to unite the country and will get credit for improving East-West relations even though Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have been more responsible for it than he. `` My view is that he will be viewed by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as an above-average president,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, a historian of the presidency at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who calls himself a moderate Democrat. `` I think the historians and biographers will treat him a little bit more harshly, still ranking him at least an average president but not as high as the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people now do or will.'' But <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who is critical of many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies, said, `` I think, in the historical sense, somewhere down the road, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of the problems that he has left us.'' If the economy turns sour in the wake of his administration's record budget and trade deficits, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may go down in history like <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> as a president who failed to take action to stave off coming disaster Some scholars said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reputation will also suffer from scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless. `` I think probably in the short range reaction in the next five or 10 years, even liberal and radical historians will find something good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a kind of quality of Americanism and a sense of national unity and he projected that from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Belz </PERSON>, a neo-conservative historian at the University of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` Whether or not in the long run our relations with the Soviets will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall of 1988 under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> I do n't know, but it would certainly look that way,'' said <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bornet </PERSON>, professor emeritus of history at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a self-described moderate Republican. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, a conservative historian at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said it is too early to evaluate <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But, echoing many of his academic colleagues, he said, `` The deficit does bother me. The deficit does bother me.'' `` I think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for a renewed sense of national pride,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional aide who teaches political science at <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and has written widely on the presidency. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said, `` On just the externalities of it, I think <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, with one huge ` if,' will probably go down as one of the most successful ones certainly in this century and maybe ever.'' However, comparing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with one of the predecessors the president most admires, <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON> also said that `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may go down in history pretty much the way <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> did'' if some economists' predictions of economic collapse come true `` Coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, a bum, but as a president whose do-nothing policies led to the huge crash of the early'30s that <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was the victim of,'' he said. Dean <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> who has devised a formula for predicting how history will rate presidents, said, `` When you put all the pros and all the cons in the equation, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> comes out as a slightly above average president.'' One of the `` pro'' factors for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON>, is the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have forged. `` He gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he did n't take the initiative for that,'' <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said. `` In all fairness, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deserves more credit than he does,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` Still,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bornet </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stepped forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and that's going to be hard to erase, I'll tell you.'' <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, similarly, argued, `` A good leader also must seize the opportunity, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered an opportunity to play for high stakes in the international arena. He seized that; he was not frozen in place by rigid ideology, and thus I think one has to give him credit.'' From <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ranny </PERSON> said the relaxation of East-West tensions was the most important of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s accomplishments in foreign policy. `` Now you might say that's because he got lucky and had <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> there, and I would n't quarrel with that,'' he said. `` Nevertheless, it did happen. And I think when historians look back at that, they will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most successful postwar presidents that we have had.'' Psychologist <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said one big factor working in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to serve eight years `` The longer you serve the more events happen that can be credited to you, whether or not you are responsible for them,'' he said. `` You make a thick chapter in the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under your name.'' Although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently pictured himself as the adversary of a `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> colony'' protecting special interests at the expense of ordinary citizens, some scholars argued that one of his own chief shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the outside.

 `` There will be a feeling that he was largely indifferent to those without voice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that he responded much more to upper middle class and middle class <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` The presidency ought to be a place which raises its voice on behalf of those who do n't have the powerful lobbies.'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> is self-described as a Democrat with a liberal viewpoint compared with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, but the more conservative <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> agreed, `` I also think <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could perhaps have done more for the homeless.'' The Iran-Contra affair and the investigations and indictments that have marked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration also will cast their shadow, the scholars said. `` The people will forget that quickly; the historians wo n't,'' said <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. `` The historians will have chapters on the sleaze stuff and they'll call it as bad or equal to the Watergate mess.'' Some who praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> highly on other grounds conceded he was not as attentive as he should have been to his duties. `` He did n't keep his ear to the ground enough and he did n't have enough interest in political life, the warp and woof of it, to do as good a job as he could have,'' said the neo-conservative <PERSON> Belz </PERSON>. In strikingly similar language, <PERSON> Ranny </PERSON> said, `` I imagine he loses a few points because of the large number of scandals and indictments and things like that,'' and <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said that `` he is probably going to get some negative points'' because of such troubles. In comparing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with past presidents, scholars cited the names ranging from <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Personality and character issues for 20 years have overwhelmed evaluation of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as president and if that's any precedent, then maybe for several decades it will be difficult to get down to serious business with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bornet </PERSON>, who has written extensively on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, he said, `` is still the crude, cornpone president, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is going to continue to be for a long time this image people watched on TV and this person the press correctly portrayed as essentially a lazy president.'' As for <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, he has undergone a re-evaluation in recent years, with scholars believing him a much more activist president than first believed. <PERSON> Ranney </PERSON> said, `` If future scholarship finds out that behind the scenes and when the truth is known <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself was also a much more hands-on active president than we now believe _ and incidentally it is unlikely that they will find that _ he might undergo the same kind of upgrading.'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, however, said, `` Definitely a comparison of <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in order. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> had a very subtle style of leadership that evidently caused him to lead more effectively than most people thought he was leading. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s leadership I do n't think will come off as that kind of subtle hidden hand leadership so much as it has been leadership through orchestration of symbols and movement of the public mind.'' On the other hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> political scientist said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may also be in for the kind of scaling down of his reputation that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has suffered as the force of his personality recedes. `` There is no longer the Camelot mystique to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>; a lot of that has worn off,'' he said. `` I suspect that with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> there will be a little bit of wearing off of the mystique that surrounds him.''

 Where most people list their job experiences, <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s resume brags, `` Arrested 26 times in seven cities.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> complains it's out-of-date. `` It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activist said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where the latest protests against abortion are being planned. Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion a high-profile issue again. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion clinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until police carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> says he is trying to produce the `` social tension'' necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960s civil rights protest as a model. `` He's the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of a movement,'' said <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brignola </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortion drive. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s critics claim Operation Rescue, so named because followers try to `` rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women's rights `` The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people. They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing human beings,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> jails during the five-day Democratic convention. Since then, demonstrations have spread to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and still more cities. The activists want the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated 1.6 million women have abortions each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used car salesman who once wanted to be a rock star. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, began their crusade in 1984 by standing in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out of entering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an office that offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down baby clothes. `` God clicked a light on in my head and said it was n't enough to just be against child-killing, that I had to do something about it,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who's selling his auto dealership because he is too busy with Operation Rescue. Critics concede <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has a mesmerizing personality. He even tries to convert relatives at family reunions, said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, his aunt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quit high school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, who is communications director for the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> chapter of Planned Parenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequently target. She stressed that she does not speak for the organization about her nephew. `` He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s transformation into a born-again Christian `` He came back a totally changed personality. It was more like a cult reaction than a spiritual quest.'' Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesman have calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child and three foster children. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessment that `` he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention. To <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, Operation Rescue is nothing new She said anti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and glued the clinic's door shut four or five times. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himself to a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for 22 days for refusing to pay a $ 60 fine. `` It does n't matter what you say to him. There is no reason involved,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` He does n't care about women. I think he really hates women.'' Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION> clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-present demonstrators at shouting distance. `` They really want to make it personal,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has shouted at her, `` How many babies did you murder today?'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being `` too nice'' during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friend like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> into not working hard for its goal. `` We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' he said. `` That's not an adequate response to murder. A logical response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the victim.'' The lean, bushy-haired <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> expects and even hopes his demonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue was responsible for 11,000 arrests in 1988 and predicts 500,000 will be arrested in 1989. There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified. `` In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their own beliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent children murdered,'' he said. `` That's like saying, ` Why ca n't a white man follow his own conscience concerning owning a black slave? Why ca n't a German follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?''' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has attracted some prominent supporters, including former presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who said he backs `` any means short of violence'' to stop abortion. If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said, they could change abortion laws in six months because the political system is not built to deal with mass protests. Yard dismisses <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> as a `` puppet'' groomed for the role of point man in the latest anti-abortion offensive. `` Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. `` The reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings -LRB- of abortion clinics -RRB- and Operation Rescue is that people do n't believe <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I know is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.'' At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted. Pinned to the wall is a large map of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with `` abortion mills'' dotted in red. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> distractedly complains to a staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will take him to a television appearance. As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from his desk, saying `` that's too casual for someone trying to change world history.'' He adds, chuckling: `` It's comical, really. I think God has a sense of humor. Do n't you think it's rather funny that a former used car salesman is heading such a movement?''

 Faced with the choice of trying to kick heroin or going back to jail, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> fought his way 14 years ago from the murky world of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s shooting galleries to the academic heights of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Now he's back on the streets. He again faces a possible jail term, but this time he's charged with illegally handing out clean needles to people he used to run with _ many of whom already have contracted AIDS by sharing dirty needles. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 33, said he does n't want to go to jail, but he's willing to risk it to try to change the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> requirement for a prescription to buy a hypodermic syringe. `` People look down on addicts, but it's through them that AIDS is going to spread to the heterosexual community,'' he says. `` People are going to have to realize that.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> is founder of a 50-member organization called the AIDS Brigade, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate students as well as former addicts and convicts. It was formed about four years ago and distributes AIDS education materials, bleach and needles in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Critics say he's a renegade, too far from mainstream efforts to curb the spread of AIDS, most often transmitted through homosexual contact and shared needles. `` I think clean needles clearly is one way of addressing the problem for addicts. It would be nice if they were available, but they're not, so we do what we can through other aspects,'' said <PERSON> Brianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Comella </PERSON>, director of Project Trust, supported by city and state funds. Project Trust volunteers distribute bottles of bleach and show addicts how to sterilize needles. `` I think that there is an absolute need for fringe groups such as the AIDS Brigade to push the system. Unfortunately, I think that they could be more effective if they worked with existing programs rather than as Lone Rangers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Commella </PERSON> said. State health officials estimate there are about 40,000 addicts in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and about one-third are believed to be carrying the AIDS virus. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> backed a needle exchange program, but it was rejected by the City Council. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, first deputy commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Hospitals, supported the attempt at a needle exchange program and said he will testify at <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s trial, which he hopes will revive interest in the program. Addicts meet AIDS Brigade workers in dingy restaurants and on street corners to get their sets of needles, known as `` the works.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> makes rounds of the neighborhoods where the people he tries to help live, such as <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, who used to shoot dope with <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> 18 years ago, but now is trying to stay clean. A thin, pale woman in her 30s with dark circles under her eyes, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> spoke at her apartment on condition her last name was n't used. She tested positive for the AIDS virus last summer, and she's sure she contracted the disease through sharing dirty needles. `` The works are hard to get,'' <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was arrested this summer and charged with illegal possession of hypodermic syringes, which he buys legally in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. The charge is a misdemeanor, but <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> requested a jury trial, which will probably take place this spring. `` I want to show that this is the logical answer to stop the spread of AIDS,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. His attorney, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON>, plans a `` necessity defense,'' saying that illegally handing out the needles is justified by the need to curb AIDS. But prosecutors say having a reason for doing something does n't excuse an offense `` We're only kidding ourselves to think -LRB- addicts -RRB- are going to go out and only use the needle once,'' said First Assistant Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney's office. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> says his personal history makes him a better judge of how addicts are likely to respond. He shot heroin as a teen-ager and robbed drug stores for money and supplies. At 17, he served more than two years time, earning his high school equivalency diploma in jail. A month after his release, in 1974, he was caught violating parole and given the choice of checking into a drug rehabilitation center or going back to jail. He chose reform. Since then, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> has worked a variety of jobs, including driving a cab and a few bouts as a local boxer, to get money to help pay his way through <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, where he studied biology, and then to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, where he is completing work on a masters degree in public health. He says he wants other addicts to have the same chance he did.

 Uniformed men beat up <PERSON> Cecilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> beneath an avocado tree, marched him and two friends down a wooded path and pounded them to death with rifle butts, witnesses say. Leftist guerrillas captured <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> as he was searching for three wayward cows, took him away and shot him. The killings are examples of the growing toll of politically motivated slayings in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1988 as both sides in a 9-year-old civil war grow frustrated with a stalemate. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Legal Aid office has counted 181 summary killings in the first 11 months of 1988, compared with 129 in all of 1987. Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said during his homily Sunday that altogether 1,369 civilians, soldiers or leftist rebels were killed last year in military clashes, rightist death squad operations and car bombings or other terrorist acts. The war has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives since it began. `` It is so hard to see any sort of light,'' said a church worker who has spent nearly two decades in <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, an eastern province divided between guerrillas and government forces. `` It's so disheartening because you had the feeling things were getting better. And now you feel them going backward, getting worse,'' the worker said on condition he not be identified. When the uniformed men had finished killing <PERSON> Cecilio </PERSON>, they went back to his house to demand food and his weapon. His mother could give them only tortillas. `` They said he was a guerrilla. But my son had no weapon, only a machete,'' said <PERSON> Dominga </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>. In her one-room mud brick home, she recounted through sobs the events of Nov. 12, when men she described as government soldiers swept into this hamlet. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> was the former mayor of another small town, <LOCATION> Lolotique </LOCATION>, 12 miles from <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>. He was searching for cows with his brother Dec. 6 when leftist guerrillas captured him, his wife said. They killed him for what they said was his complicity in a U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan. The cases in <LOCATION> Lolotique </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, a village of a dozen households 90 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, are not unique. Respect for human rights improved steadily from 1984 until 1988. The early 1980s were a time of slaughter when soldiers and rightist death squads were blamed for the slayings of about 30,000 people. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has provided more than $ 3 billion in aid this decade, told Salvadoran authorities in 1983 that support would dry up if the rights situation did not improve. Salvadoran authorities say the government no longer has any ties with right-wing death squads. The leftist guerrillas have killed eight mayors and 32 other civilians in 1988 for allegedly collaborating with the army. The Catholic Legal Aid office blames the army for 90 summary executions of suspected guerrilla collaborators. Death squads are blamed for 51 murders. The slayings of <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, 17, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, 18 and <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>, 24, devastated their families, the community council they all sat on and the village soccer team. <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> was the goalie, <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> a fullback and <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> a midfielder. <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> died with his soccer shoes on. `` I wo n't play ever again,'' his mother, <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON>, quoted him as saying as he laced up the cleats before being taken away. `` He knew. He lifted the dog's front paws and danced with him. He kissed the baby and said, ` This is it, <PERSON> Ma </PERSON>. I'm saying goodbye,''' she said. Those who took them away were government soldiers, six witnesses said. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON>'s mother said the officer in charge repeatedly accused the family of setting corn aside for the guerrillas. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, also has blamed army troops for the <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> killings and called for an investigation. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> denied army responsibility. He blamed the guerrillas, claiming they wanted to discredit the armed forces. He said army records show no troops near <LOCATION> Piedra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luna </LOCATION> on Nov. 12. He denied a request to see the records, saying they were classified. He said the case is closed. <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>'s 15-year-old brother has been a guerrilla for a year, Mrs. <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>'s father was detained for four days in October, and _ according to his family _ he was severely beaten and accused of guerrilla sympathies. The three young men, though perhaps not outright collaborators, maintained friendly relations with rebels who pass through regularly, villagers said. The community council they sat on functions with tacit guerrilla approval. When the guerrillas kill civilians, they usually announce it on their clandestine Radio Venceremos. The radio announced Dec. 9 that <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, the former mayor, was found guilty of `` crimes against the people.'' He was the secretary-general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lolotique </LOCATION>. He had been kidnapped by the guerrillas for five months in 1985. `` We explained to him how mayors are tools for the implementation of the counterinsurgency plan ... but he did not obey, and continued implementing the plan in <LOCATION> Lolotique </LOCATION>,'' said the broadcast. `` He helped whomever he could,'' said his widow, <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON>, in their home. The room where she sat contained a sort of shrine _ a crucifix and her husband's photograph surrounded by flowers in coffee cans. `` Maybe they killed him for helping the community,'' she said, a tear tracking down her cheek.

 When a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador sat down with a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation for the first official meeting in 13 years, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> scored a triumph for a foreign policy variously described as magnanimous or meddlesome. For a small country, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is engaged in other people's troubles to a surprising degree. `` Some people call it international meddling or giving unsolicited advice,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Schori </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary who is the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 official. But <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> sees its foreign diplomacy as central to its own well-being. `` Our security has not only to do with our borders. It also is affected by the international climate,'' <PERSON> Schori </PERSON> said. Increasingly, neutral <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is being used as a communications channel for parties who ca n't talk to each other. On Dec. 16, the same day the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ended its formal boycott of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauffin </PERSON>, was instrumental in mediating the release of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate who was kidnapped Nov. 17 by a Palestinian faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s approach to world affairs, sometimes criticized as moralistic and preaching, has created some ill feeling, particularly in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but also in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The late Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was blacklisted from the White House for his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War after he marched through <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> with North Vietnamese leaders. `` We believe strongly in human rights, international law and the resolution of conflicts,'' <PERSON> Schori </PERSON> said in an interview in his vaulted 18th century office. `` Our actions are motivated by a combination of self-interest and solidarity.'' The U.S.-PLO dialogue was a personal victory for Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, who worked in secret for nine months to nudge <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for ending its ban on contacts with his organization. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> success was the climax of a long process,'' <PERSON> Schori </PERSON> said. `` But the positions were blocked, and what was needed was a midwife. Somebody had to take the initiative. <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> saw that.'' <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, a wily politician with little foreign experience, came to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after nearly 20 years as secretary of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and three years as health minister. He brought with him the typically Swedish approach that any problem is solvable by discussion among reasonable men. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, which allocates 1 percent of its gross national product to foreign aid, also has provided a pool of experienced diplomats for international service. <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. He died in Dec. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> while on his way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to observe the signing of an agreement for Namibian independence from South African rule. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, was tapped by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Sept. 1 to lead Iran-Iraq peace negotiations. In less public roles, Swedish diplomats have been conduits for contacts between rival factions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, among others, <PERSON> Schori </PERSON> said. Last year the Swedes persuaded <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to visit prisoners in Cuban jails. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s international activity goes back a long way. Prime Minister <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Branting </PERSON> won the 1921 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the League of Nations. It has contributed 55,000 men to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces, which were created by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Dag </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammarskjold </PERSON>, a Swede. Count <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernadotte </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s royal family, was the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s first martyr. He was assassinated by Jewish extremists in pre-independence <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> in 1948. Four years earlier, diplomat <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> distributed Swedish passports to Hungarian Jews threatened with deportation to Nazi death camps. He was credited with saving 100,000 lives before Soviet forces arrested him at the close of the war and he disappeared. The Soviets say he died in prison in 1947, but his family is convinced he is still alive. <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarring </PERSON>, appointed special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> emissary to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after the 1967 Six-Day War, earned a footnote in history as the inventor of shuttle diplomacy, though the credit went later to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. Jarring's mission ended in failure. <PERSON> Schori </PERSON> said the relaxation of U.S.-Soviet tension may usher in a less active period for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` There's been a need for bridge-building. Now it's changing,'' he said. `` We have no ambition to be mediators. Where we have a contribution to make, we do all we can. But I see this role declining in an era of detente.''

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators rescued a post-Depression record 217 savings institutions in 1988, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to figure out the best way to pay the $ 38 billion bill. Theoretically, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the S & amp; L industry, expects enough income over the next 30 years _ $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion _ to cover the cost. But analysts and many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say regulators have run up such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable. `` We still do n't know the magnitude of the S & amp; L crisis,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said Sunday. `` We're not even certain what the regulators have been doing the past week, running up a tab of some $ 40 billion.'' Even with a last-minute spending spree of nearly $ 6 billion to rescue 22 institutions in the final 48 hours of 1988, regulators still have about 350 more insolvency cases to handle. And, as of last Sept. 30, another 150 savings institutions were sliding toward insolvency with capital levels below 1.5 percent. Estimates of the total cost of paying for the mess run as high as $ 112 billion, a figure reported last month by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing agency. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials are considering a variety of plans for the incoming administration. Most attempt to spread out the burden over time and keep as much as possible from adding to the federal budget deficit. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said, `` Somebody's going to have to pay. ... We ca n't hide it by putting it off budget or smoke and mirrors. This year's failure and rescue total _ 217 of the 3,100 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls operating at the start of the year _ is more than quadruple last year's total of 48. It is the highest total since a record 277 failures and rescues in the Depression year of 1938. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures the nation's 13,500 commercial banks, 221 banks failed or required government assistance. That is also a post-Depression record, topping the previous record of 203 in 1987. Both the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> draw their funds from an assessment on member institutions. But the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> depends on the much-larger banking industry, which as a whole is in much better shape, and enters 1989 in relatively good shape with more than $ 15 billion in reserves. <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, however, is technically insolvent. So, regulators have been patching together rescue deals with as little cash as possible. Most of the aid takes the form of various commitments secured by revenue that regulators do n't have now and in some case wo n't have for as long as 30 years. Moreover, the revenue projections depend on charging S & amp; Ls a special assessment, originally intended to be phased out in a few years, over the next three decades. Industry officials say that would drive even more S & amp; Ls into the red. The biggest rescue on the last day of 1988 was for the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a giant <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> institution whose financial problems had plagued regulators for years. The package called for the government to provide $ 983 million in assistance in the sale of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a bank holding company in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, that is putting $ 52 million into the deal. Also on Saturday, the bank board pledged: _ $ 243.3 million in aid to Home Federal Savings and Loan, a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L putting up $ 25 million to acquire three institutions in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area. They are: <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan, <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, and First Security, <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. _ $ 151.1 million in aid to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which agreed to put up $ 20.4 million into the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunrise </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ $ 29.9 million in aid to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to pay $ 1.25 million for the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Tahoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. _ $ 8 million to Home Federal Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, which is purchasing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION>, S.D.

<HEAD>Last Year Was Bloodiest In DC History: 371 Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's capital also may be the nation's murder capital In 1988, 371 people were killed in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, far surpassing the previous high of 287, set in 1969. Police say drugs are mostly to blame. Final population and homicide figures have yet to be compared, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> had the two highest per-capita murder rates in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1988. Thus, the nation's capital, where the federal government's war on drugs is mapped out, could earn the dubious distinction of being the murder capital as well. The District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s drug problems dramatize the two different Washingtons _ the Capitol, the White House and other sites visited by millions of tourists each year, and the squalid neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power. There, a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn to the status and money that come from selling drugs. Police say drugs _ particularly the arrival of crack cocaine _ are to blame for about 60 percent of the slayings. As recently as 1986, drug-related killings accounted for just one-third of the city's homicide total. The absence of organized crime in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may be a factor in the city's murder rate, officials say. Law enforcement officials say that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug market, there are fewer drug-related slayings. `` What you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting among themselves for drug turf,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` They are just working for themselves.'' Stemming the city's drug tide has become an increasingly tough battle for <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and his 3,800 officers. Earlier this year, police decided they will switch to .9 mm semiautomatic handguns out of fear that weapons commonly found on the street were outclassing the standard .38 - caliber six-shot revolver officers have The new weapons, which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots before reloading, were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted in the seizure of Uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated weaponry. Surveying the weapons at a March news conference, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called the district's streets `` something out of the wild, wild West.'' Officers will have their new guns by 1990. And police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects has n't dulled the city's appetite for narcotics. A highly-touted anti-drug program, Operation Clean Sweep, has produced more than 46,000 arrests since it began in August, 1986. However, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has complained that the program, which sends swarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make arrests, has done little more than further clog the city's already overcrowded jail and court systems. For each drug dealer arrested, another springs forward, according to <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` A lot of these kids are high school dropouts with few skills,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` They can make up to a $ 1 million a year selling drugs. What would you do?'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, who can prosecute both local and federal crimes, announced in December that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work solely on drug-related killings in the district. Turner also has called on city officials to spend more money on drug education, prevention and treatment programs. Currently, a three-week wait is common for people wanting to enroll in the city's treatment centers As for the future, police believe that as markets are more firmly established for crack, a highly-addictive cocaine derivative, the murder rate will decrease. `` This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an infusion of crack,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` When crack arrived in other cities, like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, murder rates went up there, too.''

<HEAD>Medicare, Pensions Among Changes To Take Effect With New Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ringing in the new year are dozens of changes in federal laws and regulations, many of them aimed at quenching Americans' thirst for security and a few that will make life a little more expensive. Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vast expansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, faster pension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women, and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchases on credit. Others that occurred just before the end of 1988 or are scheduled early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private employers, 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating against the handicapped and families with children. A few of the changes are a little more esoteric but their impact eventually may be felt by the entire population. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> regulations implementing the 46-nation ozone treaty took effect Jan. 1. The regulations do n't require chemical companies to actually do anything until next July, but then they must cut their production of chloroflourocarbon or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds by an estiamted 20 percent back to 1986 levels. The treaty is aimed at halting the depletion of the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles up protecting the earth's surface from ultraviolet rays. <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds also contribute to the `` greenhouse'' effect that is warming the planet. As a result of the regulations, consumers may notice fewer plastic food containers from fast-food outlets, thicker insulating panels and possibly even slightly harder seat cushions. The biggest of the immediate changes is the Jan 1. expansion of Medicare coverage for 32 million <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries to include catastrophic health care costs Prior to passage of the measure last summer by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ the first major expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> in its 22-year history _ the program paid full hospital bills for no more than 59 days a year. With the changes that took effect Sunday, the beneficiary still will have to pay the first-day deductible of $ 560. But that charge will be assessed no more than once a year no matter how many times the patient has to be hospitalized. The other 364 days are fully paid. That fundamental change in the hospital benefit was the cornerstone of the Medicare expansion set in motion by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his 1986 State of the Union message. `` Let us remove a financial specter facing our older <LOCATION> Ameicans </LOCATION> _ the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death,'' he said then. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees will pay for the new benefits through a flat increase in the premium deducted from their monthly Social Security checks and an additional sliding scale premium for approximately 40 percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax. The flat increase will be $ 4 a month effective immediately, climbing to $ 10.20 monthly in 1993. The sliding scale premium is projected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax liability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993. Many of the Jan. 1 changes grow out of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The biggest new benefit from that law is faster vesting in pension plans. The maximum waiting period for employees to become fully invested in a pension is being cut in half from 10 years to five years. However, employers can adopt an option that denies full vesting until seven years. To do so, they have to offer 20 percent vesting after three years and an additional 20 percent vesting annually until the seventh year, when it reaches 100 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the pension changes will provide a retirement stake to 2 million more workers a year. `` We'll especially see more women being vested than in the past because they tend to be in the workforce or with the same employer for shorter periods,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the institute. Another tax change is that only 20 percent of personal interest payments on everything from car and student loans to credit card charges will be deductible in 1989, compared with 40 percent last year. And while the government is now raising tax brackets, exemptions and standard deductions to keep cost-of-living raises from bumping people into higher brackets, it also is taking more Social Security taxes. The 7.51 percent Social Security tax took a maximum $ 3,380 out of employee paychecks in 1988. This year the maximum amount of income subject to the tax rises from $ 45,000 to $ 48,000, raising the maximum Social Security tax that can be collected from an individual employee to $ 3,605. The latest change came about just last Thursday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered airlines, effective Jan. 1, to either inspect by hand or X-ray all luggage checked aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline flights from western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The new inspections, prompted by the bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21, are expected to delay passenger check-ins by about an hour. Other changes taking effect slightly before or after New Year's Day include: _ The use of polygraph or lie detector tests by private employers to screen job applicants was outlawed, with some exceptions, effective last Tuesday The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> estimates the law will effectively eliminate about 80 percent of the 2 million polygraph exams now administered annually. _ A 47-year-old ban on homework in five apparel trades is being removed on Jan. 8, unless unions which support the prohibitions win a court stay first. Affected are an estimated 50,000 to 75,000 workers in fields such as mittens and gloves, embroideries, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry trades. They will be able to work legally at home for the first time if their employers obtain a certficate from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after pledging to abide by minimum wage and other federal labor standards. _ A law requiring employers to provide 60 days advance notice of plant closings or layoffs affecting 50 or more people officially takes effect Feb. 4. However, there are different interpretations on whether companies are required to have provided 60 days notice beforehand if they close a plant on that date. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advised in early December that, to avoid potential liability, they should. _ Regulations implementing a law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer forbidding landlords from discriminating against the handicapped or families with children take effect March 12. Violators can be fined up to $ 10,000 for a first offense, $ 25,000 for a second violation in a five-year period and $ 50,000 for two or more violations within a seven-year period.

<HEAD>Volcano Eruption In Southern Chile May Last Two Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Christmas Day eruption of the snow-capped <LOCATION> Lonquimay </LOCATION> volcano in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is gaining in force and seismologists say they expect it to continue for at least another two months. Authorities have issued masks to residents who are remaining in the area to protect them from a thick cloud of ash spewed by the volcano over a sparsely populated area of about 12 square miles. And scientists estimate that 525 million cubic feet of lava have oozed out of the 8,400-foot volcano, toward an uninhabited valley, since the eruption began. Lonquimay, a peak in the Andes foothills about 400 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, had been dormant for a century when it erupted on Christmas Day. Authorities say the eruption poses no danger for two nearby villages, <LOCATION> Lolco </LOCATION> and Malacahuello. Residents of both towns quickly evacuated after the eruption, and some later returned home. But many remain lodged at schools and municipal buildings in <LOCATION> Curacautin </LOCATION>, a city 50 miles away. Authorities on Saturday issued masks to the few residents who had returned to their homes. Researchers, soldiers and police officers also in the area were also wearing the white masks. On Sunday, the volcano continued to spew smoke and lava through a 300-foot-wide crater. The volcano initially showed three separate smaller fissures, but a series of explosions joined them into a single crater, authorities said. Seismologists from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontera </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Temuco </LOCATION>, the largest city in the region, said a 1,200-foot-wide, 30-foot-high mass of lava is slowly slipping down the volcano. They said the route followed by the lava is the same as the one in the Lonquimay's previous eruption, in 1889, and poses no danger for the population. Livestock in the area were removed to safer zones, police said.

 Outgoing Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> says her successor needs to carve out a place on President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s team of top economic advisers to help solve the nation's competitiveness Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, the only woman in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` On occasion I've felt that we were spending too much time looking backward instead of preparing a human resource policy for the future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently named former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as the next labor secretary and _ so far _ the only woman in his Cabinet. But he did not give her what Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> thinks the labor secretary needs: a designated spot on his top economic team right alongside the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments and the White House budget office and <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, during her 14-month Cabinet stint, sought to heighten business awareness of employee needs such as job retraining, flexible hours and child-care assistance, and emphasized the links between education and competitiveness. `` I see the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as an economic arm,'' she said. `` I think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is headed there. The question is how do we get to the next step.'' `` The name of the game is going to be competitiveness and unless the incoming labor secretary moves in there and ties the human resource issues with the equation ... we're going to have a skills shortage,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, in what she calls her holistic approach to workplace issues, has often complained that too many people in government, labor and business are looking backward and constantly fighting over turf. During her brief tenure, Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> spent a good part of her time in those skirmishes, fighting her way into them on occasion and sometimes finding herself on the sidelines. It was on her watch that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> won its first major legislative victories in a decade: a ban on the use of polygraphs or lie detectors by private employers to screen job applicants and mandatory advance notices of plant closings and large layoffs once vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. With Sens. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., forming an uncharacteristic but also unstoppable alliance on the first, Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> helped persuade the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to acquiesce to the polygraph ban rather than continue opposing it on behalf of some business groups She was relegated to the sidelines on the second, with then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> using the plant closing notices as the primary reason for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto legislation overhauling the nation's trade laws. When Republican moderates from northern and midwestern states with large blue-collar constituencies wanted to cut a deal last spring in which labor would get advance notices of plant closings but not other layoffs, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said no. Four months later, with polls showing that more than 80 percent of voters favored advance layoff warnings, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chief, persuaded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to let the notices for both layoffs and plant closings become law without his signature `` Plant closing was bigger than all of us,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. `` There was never a time when the plant closing situation was really thought through. If I'm remiss, I suppose I should have hollered louder.'' As the former No. 2 official in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> relished playing the broker, mediating disputes between environmentalists and oil companies and cutting deals on Alaskan and offshore drilling. She tried the same approach at <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, finding that while union leaders and business executives spoke glowingly of cooperation, they were often unyielding in practice. `` Organized labor is not there yet in its role of what it can do for itself and this country with regard to training, a quality work force and all the issues of the workplace as we move into the 21st Century,'' she said. `` And they wo n't be there, in my view, if they continue just to back mandated legislation piecemeal to address workers' needs. `` On the other hand, business is n't there yet either. It will hold the line on legislation, just like labor will push it, instead of finding out what's driving these things,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said she will keep speaking out on child care, flextime, education, drugs _ the human resource issues that she says will determine the nation's economic health in the 1990s. She claimed she is not surprised not to have a role in the new administration, although she had declared her availability early. `` I expected <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to find his team, his people,'' she said. `` It's time to leave because I leave on a high. I join a prestigious group of people who were here only a year or two years.''

 Ants, ants and more ants are marching into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area homes, crawling up Christmas trees and making themselves a nuisance in unprecedented numbers because of winter's sudden onset `` They give me the heebie-jeebies.

<HEAD>Chief Justice Backs 51 Percent Pay Raise For Jurists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> has strongly endorsed a proposal to raise federal judges' salaries by 51 percent to $ 135,000 a year. In his 1988 year-end report on the federal judiciary, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> threw his weight behind a presidential commission's recommendation of big pay raises for judges and about 2,000 other top federal officials. Besides calling for the pay raise for trial judges, who now make $ 89,500, the commission recommended boosting salaries of federal appeals court judges from $ 95,000 to $ 140,000, a 47 percent jump; of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> associate justices from $ 110,000 to $ 165,000, a 50 percent increase; and of the chief justice from $ 115,000 to $ 175,000, a 52 percent increase. The recommendations are pending before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who can accept or modify the figures before sending his fiscal 1990 budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 9. Under the law, whatever pay increases the president endorses will take effect 30 days later unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to set them aside. `` Over the past two decades, the purchasing power of federal judicial salaries has been seriously eroded by inflation,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. The buying power of an appeals court judge's salary has dropped 30 percent in the past 20 years, said the chief justice, adding, `` While the salary of the median household has increased approximately 200 percent to keep pace with inflation since 1969, the salaries of federal -LRB- trial -RRB- judges rose by little more than half that amount.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> cited a recent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> survey in which 30 percent of the federal judges who responded said they planned to resign before retirement unless `` a significant increase in compensation'' is provided. `` Dozens of federal judges have resigned from the bench during the past 15 years, far more than ever before, due in large part to financial reasons,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. `` And the problem appears to be growing worse.'' He said judicial salaries are directly linked to `` the quality of American justice.'' Comparing justice and medical care, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, `` We are interested in receiving the best medical care available. If the quality of medical treatment is poor, it is little consolation that the cost may be low.'' He added: `` The right to one's day in court is meaningless if the judge who hears the case lacks the talent, experience and temperament that will enable him to protect imperiled rights and to render a fair decision.''

<TEXT>
 Deep in the basement of a suburban family home, 220 ferrets from all around the country frolic with toy balls, crawl tubes and other ferret-phernalia in a makeshift halfway house for the weasel-like creatures. The ferrets, unwanted by their owners or between homes, are the pride and joy of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahm </PERSON>, who keeps 14 of her own upstairs. It started 18 months ago when a group of concerned Chicago-area ferret-lovers formed the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahm </PERSON>, the only founding officer with a basement, was asked to run the association's shelter. She agreed. So when a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> woman recently asked her veterinarian what to do with two ferrets her older son had outgrown, she was told to head for the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahm </PERSON> home. There, the ferrets live in cages until a new owner is found. `` We've gotten ferrets from all over the country,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahm </PERSON>, who prefers to keep the location of her home a secret so as not to disturb the neighbors. Some were transported from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A batch from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> arrived after animal-welfare officials seized 19 ferrets from a <LOCATION> Louisville-area </LOCATION> woman who kept them in a cramped back-yard shed. Others come from disenchanted owners. `` It was not what I expected,'' one woman said, complaining that her ferret did not like to sit in her lap to be stroked like a cat. `` They are more exotic than dogs or cats,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahm </PERSON> said. `` They are good for apartment dwellers because they are small and can be kept in cages most of the time. `` They also have a bit of a wild look, and they do n't provoke allergies,'' she said. Of the nation's estimated 5 million pet ferrets, about 10,000 live in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> based in suburban <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>. She said the association was formed because `` so much was unknown'' about ferrets. `` We wanted to say, ` Hey, these little guys are n't so bad.'' Ferret lovers say the animal's reputation as a sometimes vicious biter is unfounded. They are often mistakenly considered rodents but related to weasels and mink. Like cats, they can be trained to use litter boxes and will eat cat food. `` They have a strong will to survive,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> veterinarian and another association member. `` They are easy to work with. I'm seldom bitten. In fact, I'm bitten far more often by iguanas and birds.''

 Not long ago, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was a mere rubber-stamp body that met for just four three-day sessions a year. Now, outspoken deputies are openly demanding accountability from Communist authorities. Live television coverage came to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in September, and its 383 deputies have since begun edging the once-tame forum toward democracy. Increasingly, deputies are bringing into the open formerly taboo subjects such as defense spending. They challenge government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders to adhere to their avowed policy of openness and disclose facts and figures. The changes, more rapid than political reforms occuring in <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have prompted rare admissions from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership about how parliamentary work was controlled in the past. <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON>, head of the party's parliamentary group, was quoted by the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> as admitting that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders once met with deputies to tell them how to vote. On live radio and television, constituents watch closely what one <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> man termed the `` great theater'' emanating from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 19th century quarters on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> _ and are exercising their own rights as a result. Deputy <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Eke </PERSON> says he has received a `` tremendous response'' from constituents since the broadcasts began. Just two days into December's session, he had already received eight letters commenting on his behavior in debates. Deputies now meet often, and debate into the night. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> held the year's unprecedented fifth session, the third in as many months. The agenda was so long that speaker <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadinger </PERSON> announced an unprecedented Christmas recess, with business to resume Jan. 10. Mindful of November's exhausting session, when deputies worked 12 hours a day to get through the agenda, he also limited the length of daily sessions in the high, gilded chamber. The non-Communists who make up 25 percent of the deputies then took another unprecedented step, banding together in a formal group intended as a counterweight to the long-established group of Communist parliamentarians. <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, coordinator for the new group, told <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> it aims to obtain the same information as Communist deputies. The non-Communists include one of the most outspoken deputies, <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON>, a television journalist from southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> who was expelled from the Communist party earlier this year for his views. In October, <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON> stunned the chamber when he and other deputies requested a change in voting procedures on a controversial dam and power plant project opposed by many Hungarians as damaging to the environment. His request for a roll call vote sparked an acrimonious, spontaneous debate that was eventually settled by compromise. Taking government and party leaders at their word that this Soviet bloc country's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> should be more independent, <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON> and other deputies have also called for new elections prior to those planned for 1990. The reformers say the current legislature _ with 75 percent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> deputies _ is incapable of making independent decisions. In some ways, the changes in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> mirror events in the society at large. Within weeks this fall, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> went from debating whether a multi-party system was feasible to discussing how soon it would come about. The Communist leadership _ the country's ruling force _ has appealed for patience, saying the package of political reforms it outlined in November will take 18 to 24 months to introduce. Deputy Justice Minister <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilenyi </PERSON> has said a new constitution and a law on establishing political parties will be adopted before the 1990 elections. <ORGANIZATION> Non-Communist </ORGANIZATION> candidates were allowed to contest and win seats in the last elections in 1985. But debates that seemed fiery and controversial then now seem dull. In December, for example, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> transport official <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Derzsi </PERSON> won only a simple majority when elected to head a new `` superministry'' for construction, transport and communications. Just 25 deputies voted against <PERSON> Derzsi </PERSON> _ the only candidate put forward by Communist premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>. But 128 abstained in a vote that was forced into a recount after one deputy complained the 115 tally for absentions was inaccurate. On the dam project vote in October, <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> admitted the Communist leadership `` gave a firm orientation'' to party deputies not to support a referendum or the organization of international supervision. But he added swiftly in a December interview, `` This belongs to the past.''

 <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON> said he believes his latest marriage will last forever. But then, he felt the same way about the previous 16. `` I'm a very optimistic individual,'' said <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON>, who is nearly two weeks into his latest marriage. His shortest marriage lasted two weeks, his longest about five years. `` Some people say once you're married, that's it _ you go through thick and thin,'' said <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON>, 46, sitting on his sofa and stroking a long-haired cat. `` I like this cat, but if this cat scratches me, I'll put it down.'' <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON>'s 48-year-old wife, <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON>, was unconcerned about his previous marriages. `` I never heard of a man being married that many times,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON> nearly two weeks ago. `` But it did n't bother me a bit.'' According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the highest number of verified marriages in the monogamous world is 27. The Yelders live in a small, green house. Mrs. <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON> works as a part-time nurse's assistant. <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON>, who has been unemployed since heart surgery nearly 19 years ago, does the cooking. `` My wife is the breadwinner,'' he said Sunday night. `` I cook and clean up. I'm the house man.'' <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON> said he has no regrets about his previous marriages. He said his divorces can show people that `` there's a way out of marriage without violence. In all those marriages I've never killed any one; I've never shot anyone.'' `` A divorce can be mended, a broken heart can be mended, but once you're 6 feet under, it's all over,'' he said. `` That's my philosophy.'' Probate courts list 16 of <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON>'s marriages, starting at age 18 when he married a 15-year-old girl. He said he had only three children during his marriages, but has fathered 11 illegitimate children. As for his new wife, `` If she said tonight, ` Baby it's over, pack your grip, make your trip,''' he would end the marriage, <PERSON> Yelder </PERSON> said.

Democrats, firmly, to fix figure to $32 billion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like prizefighters entering the ring, Republican President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will return to the political arena this month, after two months of preparation, with lots of smiles and a handshake. And as in any championship, high-stakes fight, it will be only a matter of time before someone ends up with a bloodied nose _ the tough, veteran Democrats who have controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for years, or the Republican administration, which showed in last fall's campaign that when the going got tough, it did, too. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s new Democratic majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, already has asked the president-elect to approach <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with `` candor, consultation and trust.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who promised a `` kinder and gentler nation'' in his successful campaign, has indicated he wants a closer relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> than that enjoyed by his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Round One wo n't begin until after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated on the West Front of the Capitol on Jan. 20 and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns the following Monday, Jan. 23. Then, however brief, will come that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> institution, the political honeymoon. But unlike other <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> institutions, the honeymoon probably wo n't last long. Democrats, firmly in control of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, are anxiously awaiting the new president's budget recommendations, starting with his ideas on how to save $ 32 billion to meet deficit-reduction targets. Then, in May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise the national debt ceiling above its current $ 2.8 trillion figure. Democrats also will have their own agenda to push, perhaps a renewed drive for a hike in the minimum wage, and other costly plans to compete for tight budget dollars. And all these problems and programs come wrapped in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise not to raise taxes `` The deficit is a time bomb with a lighted fuse,'' Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., said in a recent interview `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tendered solution, his flexible freeze, is deja voodoo all over again The idea that we can grow our way out of this mess is absolute nonsense.'' The question is: How can a Republican president, elected by a solid majority, deal with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, also elected by a solid majority? History, it seems, is against the president. `` Presidential success is mainly a function of the number of seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> held by the president's party,'' say writers <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malbin </PERSON> of the House Republican Conference, in their book, `` Vital Statistics on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Using figures compiled by Congressional Quarterly, the congressional observers uncovered some stark statistics. `` When one party controls both branches, success never drops below 75 percent,'' they said. `` With divided government, presidents average well below that level of success.'' For example, when <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> swept into office in 1964, his agenda, measured by public positions, was near 88 percent successful in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Republican <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, however, managed only a 58.2 percent `` victory'' rate in first full year in office. When <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> marched into the White House in 1976 with his party in control of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he enjoyed, initially, a 75 percent success rate in pushing his legislation. But that should n't be the case in 1989, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowing no new taxes and Democrats almost daring him to run the country without them. `` It is n't a question of economics, it's a question of mathematics,'' says <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Surely he must have a plan,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. Across the Capitol, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also is offering to reason with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The larger objective is to provide to our people the greatest possible individual liberty and economic opportunity,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Our system, divided or not, can do that. But it can do it only if there is a shared understanding of the need for candor, consultation and trust.'' `` Divided government can not work in a polarized society, one in which mistrust and deceit are widespread,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> added.

<HEAD>27 Arrested Outside Pilgrim Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-seven people were arrested during a demonstration to protest the Pilgrim nuclear plant's restart nearly three years after it was closed for management and maintenance problems. Those arrested, who were among more than 125 demonstrators, were charged with trespassing and released, authorities said. `` It was a symbolic show of our frustration, of our determination not to go away,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON>, a member of Citizens for Responsible Energy. The protesters gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Duxbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday morning and positioned themselves at the entrance to one of the plant's two main gates. One protester, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yarmouth </LOCATION>, said she is a 12th-generation descendant of a Pilgrim born on the Mayflower. `` Why are they still making these wasteful products with no place to dump them?'' she asked during the hour-long protest. On Friday, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for low-power testing of the 670-megawatt reactor for up to 5 percent of its capacity. If the plant's restart schedule is followed, Pilgrim will provide customers power when it hits 10 percent of capacity sometime next month. It will reach full power in four months. Pilgrim had been shut since April 1986, when the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> called the reactor `` one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the country. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> has spent about $ 200 million since the shutdown to replace nearly all of the plant's top management, fix mechanical problems and fight skepticism by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and a growing anti-nuclear movement among residents. But the state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from operating. State officials including Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have said evacuation plans for those living near the plant are inadequate despite utility company revisions. They also have said the plant should not reopen until a new study of leukemia rates of nearby residents is complete.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said all nations must cooperate to track down whoever sabotaged <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 but made clear she opposes an `` eye for an eye'' revenge attack that could harm innocent people. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> welcomed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s reported offer to help in identifying any suspects. However, he said he still had no evidence linking a terrorist group to the plastic explosives bomb that downed the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> distanced herself Sunday from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vows to punish the culprits, saying `` I do n't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever valid.'' The Dec. 21 explosion and crash at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> killed all 259 people on board. Another 11 people on the ground are missing and presumed dead. `` The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought to justice,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in a television interview with journalist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>. `` Revenge is never a good word to use because it can affect innocent people,'' she added. The Sunday Express, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, reported without attribution that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has vowed to dispatch an assassination squad to hunt down and kill whoever is responsible. The paper said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also sent a message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledging `` a traitor's death'' for the bomber if its operatives find him first. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say no group has offered a credible claim of responsibility for the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused mostly on Palestinian extremists opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that a report overseen by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advocating possible military action against terrorists `` ought to be giving some people sleepless nights'' in the wake of the bombing. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed last week to `` seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did this, if you could ever find them.'' Sessions, interviewed Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has `` a wealth of information he can give us'' but said he opposes any attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader to retaliate by killing any suspects. `` We believe in the system of justice,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director said. `` We hope those people are handled in the courts.'' He added that contacts between the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> presumably could be set up by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials opened a dialogue Dec. 17 after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Sessions said he anticipated a lengthy investigation into the crash. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers based in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to bomb <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on April 15, 1986, in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> sponsorship of international terrorism. At least 100 people were killed in the raid. She said Sunday that no country should grant the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bombers safe haven or permit them to escape justice. `` I think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not try to track down terrorists, absolutely disgusted,'' she said. Searchers in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> gave up their traditional New Year's celebrations Sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and wreckage Police said that one more body, thought to be one of the missing local residents, was recovered, bringing the total found to 242. British newspapers reported Saturday that investigators believe the bomb was smuggled onto the flight in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, possibly by a Lebanese-born passenger duped into carrying it. The West German government said no evidence supports those reports. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 and switched to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 A Palestinian held by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner may hold clues to the group that blew up Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last month. Whether he will ever tell his story in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court is an open question. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has twice delayed the extradition of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 39, who is thought by Western intelligence experts to specialize in the planting of bombs aboard jetliners and to be a senior operative in the May 15 Palestinian terrorist group. The Rashid case has taken on extra significance since the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which killed all 259 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and about a dozen on the ground. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European officials are focusing on the May 15 group and another extremist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, as possible suspects in the bombing. On Nov. 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> indefinitely postponed its decision on extraditing <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had failed to supply key documents in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> says the requested documents have been turned over to the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government. `` The requested papers have been sent. I guess they are being moved from ministry to ministry,'' said an embassy representative, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of planting a bomb that exploded on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet as it flew from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> six years ago. A Japanese teenager was killed and 15 people were hurt. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport on May 29 on a tip from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and was sentenced to seven months in jail for entering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with a false passport. American officials have claimed <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> and the May 15 organization _ which is named for the date the 1948 Arab-Israeli War began _ also involved in the 1986 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> that killed four Americans. That blast is not mentioned in the extradition request. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has not said when it will issue its decision. An extradition ruling has to be approved by Justice Minister <PERSON> Vassilis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotis </PERSON> before it can be carried out. The long delays in <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s case, combined with the rejection of an Italian plea for extradition of another Palestinian, have given rise to charges that <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is not committed to combating international terrorism. In early December, the government reneged on an extradition agreement with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and put 27-year-old <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Zomar </PERSON> on a plane to <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zomar </PERSON> was suspected of helping to organize a September 1982 attack on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main synagogue that killed a 2-year-old boy and left 37 people injured. The Palestinian had been imprisoned in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since November 1982, when he was arrested at the Greek-Turkish border driving a car loaded with explosives. Justice Minister <PERSON> Rotis </PERSON> said he overturned a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> extradition decision because <PERSON> Zomar </PERSON> was `` acting in the struggle for the re-acquisition of his homeland.'' <PERSON> Zomar </PERSON> had been identified as one of two Arabs jailed in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with links to the extremist <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> faction <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by terrorist mastermind <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. The other is <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabrouki </PERSON>, serving a 10-year jail term for trying to shoot the Jordanian charge d'affairs in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in 1984. According to Greek and Western intelligence officials, <PERSON> Zomar </PERSON>'s detention may have triggered an attack on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship last July near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> Nine people were killed and 11 others were injured in the assault. There have been no arrests in connection with the ship attack, but one of the four men apparently involved in the machine-gun and grenade assault has been identified by Greek police as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON>, 40, the alleged operations officer for the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group. In the past, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has been criticized by its Western allies for failing to crack down on suspected Palestinian terrorists operating out of the country. Last year, the government was accused of allowing the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group to operate a logistics office in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in return for a promise by the group that it would not launch attacks in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The office was shut down in July 1987 after strong protests from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s allies. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has repeatedly denied it is soft on terrorism. `` The government condemns all forms of terrorism and takes all measures it deems necessary to fight it,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said recently.

<TEXT>
 The New Year rumbled into <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> with an earthquake, left thousands homeless in <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> fireworks accidents and claimed at least 51 lives in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> when a tour ship capsized. But 1989 brought a warm exchange of greetings from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It ushered in a prayer for peace by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader in war-torn <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and a tentative olive branch from one <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to the other. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the guns again roared, despite a New Year's cease-fire resolution by the Soviet-backed regime Rocket and artillery barrages ended a brief truce between rival Shiite Moslem militias in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Traditions persisted. Thousands blew noisemakers in Times Square in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to watch 1989 begin, and millions of Japanese went more sedately to temples and shrines to pray for health and prosperity as the year of the snake slithered in. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a preservation group found Sunday that the tower of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> leaned a little more during 1988, tilting another .0508 inches toward the ground. At that rate, it will take at least a century to topple. In <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> pledged `` socialism or death'' in a televised speech marking the 30th anniversary of his communist revolution. Revelers on a jammed cruise ship in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> listened to samba music as they sailed for a fireworks display off <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The boat capsized, and authorities said at least 51 people drowned. Survivors said few life jackets were accessible when the 100-foot Bateau Mouche went down. Illegal fireworks ignited six fires in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Sunday, leaving thousands of people homeless, authorities said. Hospital officials said seven people died from shootings and stabbings in New Year's celebrations and brawls in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> A check with doctors at 20 <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> hospitals showed 1,134 people were injured, mostly by fireworks. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today called for an end to the widely ignored ban on fireworks and `` some kind of regulation and control to minimize'' accidents. Fire killed at least one person and destroyed 3,000 makeshift houses in one slum neighborhood. At least 733 revelers in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were reported injured by fireworks, none seriously. At least two deaths and dozens of injuries were attributed to fireworks accidents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. An earthquake registering 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shook <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, but officials had no report of injuries. It came after the lights went out in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> for the second New Year's in a row in a power blackout believed caused by leftist guerrillas. Children injured by the Dec. 7 earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> received toys and clothes from around the world, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet news agency said a boy from <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was asked what he wanted from <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, a bearded man who brings gifts on New Year's. `` Let him return my mother,'' 8-year-old <PERSON> Armen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazaryan </PERSON> said from his hospital bed. The new year elicited olive branches from leaders worldwide. North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, in a New Year's speech, invited South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to a political conference in the near future. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> each sent New Year's messages to each other's country. On Soviet television, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` Despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground.'' In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said urged an end to a 10-year-old civil war in which he said 1,369 people died in 1988. `` This situation is a heart-breaking cry that summons us to keep striving for peace with the weapons the gospel has put in our hands: the weapons of light, of hope, of reconciliation, all the fruits of love,'' he said. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> told 20,000 worshipers at New Year's Mass in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica that nations should give special attention to minorities and urged kidnappers to release their hostages. `` Let's hope that it is the year of peace, of justice, of growing solidarity, of social solicitude for each one and for everybody,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the government had promised a New Year's Day cease-fire. But guerrillas attacked government troops in two villages Sunday in an eastern province and eight guerrillas were killed, official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said. A bomb blast at a temple in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> killed at least five Hindus as they prayed on Sunday, 1989's first victims of continuing Sikh militant violence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s northwestern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, officials said 11 teen-age inmates at a juvenile detention center died in a fire that apparently started during a jailbreak _ five minutes before the new year.

<HEAD>Castro Rejects Soviet Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution, rejected market-oriented economic reforms and said that for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, it is `` socialism or death.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s remarks, in a televised speech Sunday night, seemed aimed at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Communist countries that have been abandoning strict adherence to Marxist doctrine. `` Today we say with more force than ever, socialism or death, Marxism - Leninism or death,'' he said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> spoke to a large gathering from the balcony of the municipal building in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, where he had proclaimed victory for his revolutionary struggle on Jan. 1, 1959. He did not refer directly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in his remarks, saying only that the contemporary situation has been marked by `` confusion.'' In other speeches, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has been more explicit about his rejection of the reform policies of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He has said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will never embrace any reforms that `` reek of capitalism.'' He also has acknowledged that the changes under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could cause `` difficulties'' for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Cuban-Soviet friendship, although far from breaking up, seems more tenuous now than it has been in decades. A key question is whether Soviet unhappiness with the way <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has used economic aid from the Kremlin _ estimated at $ 5 billion annually _ will lead to cutbacks. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has used the economic aid to help build his country's schools and hospitals, the Soviets say, and has neglected industrial development. Calling the revolution a `` beacon of light before the eyes of the world'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has an enormous responsibility to Third World countries to stick to its present hard-line Marxist-Leninist course. Much of <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s speech was devoted to reviewing the revolutionary heritage of the people of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other cities in eastern <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is expected to deliver a policy address on Wednesday. Despite Sunday's call for ideological steadfastness, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> policy has undergone some drastic changes in the past year, including its recent commitment to withdraw its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by 1991. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has been aggressively pursuing interests common to other countries in the area. The evolution of democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which has been welcomed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has also had the ironic side effect of opening diplomatic opportunities for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader, once known for his efforts to promote violent revolution, now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with elected governments. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> attended presidential inagurations in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in recent months and may participate in the inauguration of the President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> next month. During <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in late November, his first since he was exiled there in the 1950s, he said he envisions the eventual unity of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` One day, we will make one big giant,'' he said.

<HEAD>PTL Bankruptcy Judge Calls Bakker `Sawed-Off Runt'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The judge who presided over <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings said he received threats during the case, and could n't understand why <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s followers `` were interested in that little, sawed-off runt. <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who retired Saturday at age 81 as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy judge, was guarded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals during the bankruptcy proceedings as the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigated the threats. `` They did n't say, ` I'm going to kill you.' They said, ` The Lord's going to take you,''' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` I did n't know Christians could be so critical. They would just chew me out.'' When a woman called the bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to find out if he was a Christian, `` I said, ` You tell her I was when I started this case, but now I plead the Fifth Amendment.''' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said television ministries are `` wide open'' for mismanagement or corruption. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should pass a very strong act forcing the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ... to make them comply with an accounting,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` We have all kinds of laws protecting consumers. Religion is just another consumer item, just the same as selling soap or washing powders or aspirin.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> also said he was amazed at the response to the travails that brought down <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s evangelistic empire. `` What puzzled me was why people were interested in that little, sawed-off runt,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, responded Sunday, saying: `` I am shocked to find Judge <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> so prejudiced toward us, and to hear of him making fun of us and the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> partners. ... `` He should not have tried the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> case with these feelings against us.'' The ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws in June 1987, three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. Two months ago, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and former aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> to repay <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> nearly $ 7.7 million in benefits he found to be excessive. Last month, he approved the sale of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> assets to a Canadian businessman. Also last month, a federal grand jury indicted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former top aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> on charges including fraud and conspiracy, accusing them of diverting more than $ 4 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for their own benefit. Two other former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials were indicted. Upon his retirement, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> sand he left the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> case discouraged and somewhat cynical. From the beginning, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he believed the only way to save <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> was to keep it intact as a religious operation. `` It's a one-purpose center, a religious center _ a wonderful idea,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had employed reasonable business principles, just on an average, they would n't owe a dime.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he was disappointed at the outcome of the case. `` When you've had 40,000 cases _ at least; when you've had success in lots of them, the majority of them; when you take the one most publicized, best known, and you make a failure, you ca n't feel very good. It's that simple,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to take a bath and forget about it,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` Someone asked me what was the best part of the whole case. I said, ` Getting out.'''

<HEAD>Residents Clean Up from Burst Dike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of two states today cleaned up homes damaged by a 12-foot wall of water that surged down the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after an dike broke, forcing 1,500 people to evacuate and closing Interstate 15. The 2,000-foot earthen dike 15 miles east of here gave way early Sunday, flooding 50 to 60 homes and 100 apartment units in southwest <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and three homes in <LOCATION> Littlefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, authorities said. No injuries were reported. The dam, which was less than 4 years old, had a history of seepage, authorities said. When civil defense sirens signaled the evacuation shortly after midnight Saturday, some of the 1,500 people in the flood's path mistakenly thought they heralded the new year, officials said. <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and her husband had 20 minutes to evacuate before the water hit. They sat on a hill watching through binoculars. `` We sat there hoping and praying the river would n't get us,'' she said. `` The river did n't hit everyone. I do n't know how it chose us, but we really got nailed.'' The water surged into the <ORGANIZATION> Hansens </ORGANIZATION>' home, filling the basement to the ceiling and doing structural damage estimated at $ 40,000. In <LOCATION> Littlefield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 27, his wife and five children rescued many of their belongings before their adobe home was submerged in 5 feet of water. `` The bad part was making sure my wife and the kids were OK,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` I was scared.'' <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> flew to the region 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, declared <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> a disaster area in an attempt to gain state and federal aid. At a news conference, <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said the dike, built for $ 23.5 million in 1983, would be rebuilt. He said engineers would try to determine the cause of the 300-foot-wide breach that opened. The dike had helped contain Quail Creek Reservoir. In all, 25,000 acre feet of water rushed through the breach and down the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but the surge was short-lived. By midday, it had slowed to a trickle and power had been restored. Interstate 15, closed for 14 hours, was reopened after several bridges spanning the river were declared safe. Two bridges in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> area were washed out, closing part of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> 9. Seepage at the dike dated to 1985, the year the reservoir was filled, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Water Conservancy District. Even before construction, state geologists had warned that the presence of gypsum salt in the bedrock beneath the dike could cause problems. Gypsum dissolves if exposed to water for prolonged periods. Previous leaks were repaired with little difficulty, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. New seepage was discovered Saturday morning, and by evening what had been small water loss had expanded to a major leak, said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. Heavy equipment was dispatched to reinforce the dike, but by 10:30 p.m. it became apparent nothing could be done to prevent a breach and the machinery was pulled out.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Eats Spiders, Snow to Survive Six Days Lost in Forest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 15-year-old who got lost in the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> survived six days and bitter-cold nights by sleeping in hollow logs and eating snow and spiders, his mother said. `` I do n't know how he did it, being out there in 20 degrees and below,'' <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said of her son, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>. `` He kept telling himself he had more to do in life. He's a strong boy, and he's got a will to live.'' The boy was in fair condition early today at <LOCATION> Sharp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was being treated for minor frostbite and hunger, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said. `` His feet are swollen ... and very bruised,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of rural Guatay. `` He's lost about 20 pounds.'' A father and son who had gone for a drive in the eastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> backcountry found the missing teen-ager Friday, three days after authorities abandoned their search despite protests by his parents. Though the boy was wearing several pairs of socks, thermal underwear, a flannel shirt and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> field jacket, nighttime temperatures dipped into the 20s for several days while he was missing. `` It's just a miracle that he was found alive out there as low as the temperatures dropped,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The youth had become separated from a friend while returning home Dec. 23 from an overnight fishing trip with a group of boys. He had frostbitten feet and toes when he arrived at the hospital by ambulance, <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said her son could n't remember some things that happened or the order in which events occurred. But he could recall crawling, walking and jogging through the forest, eating snow and spiders, sleeping in a hollow log and burying himself under a mound of dirt to stay warm, she said. `` I asked him, ` How can you eat spiders?' and he said, ` I plucked off the legs and ate them,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The boy was rescued by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsborn </PERSON>, 60, a retired firefighter from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, and his son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, 29. `` He was just off under some oak trees wandering around,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsborn </PERSON> said. `` He was disoriented. He did n't know where he was, how long he was out there or what day it was.'' While driving him back to <LOCATION> Guatay </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> recalled how he ate handfuls of snow because water in the ravines was foul, the elder <PERSON> Orsborn </PERSON> said. `` He mentioned that he had tried to eat some crawdads from a stream, but that they made him sick,'' <PERSON> Orsborn </PERSON> said. Authorities had abandoned their search Tuesday after dogs trailing his scent lost it near a roadside. Sheriff's officials said they believed <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who ran away from home once before, hitched a ride out of the forest and was safe. `` I do feel angry that they just quit,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` We did n't give up, though. We had a search party ready to go.'' A taped statement issued by the sheriff's department said officials will review how the search for <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was conducted.

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Readying Anti-Satellite Laser</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Miracl cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon will present the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration with a proposal to test a giant laser weapon modified so that it can destroy enemy satellites, according to a published report. The proposal could spark controversy, because some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others oppose the development of anti-satellite technology on the grounds that it could escalate the arms race. The laser, named Miracl, was designed to shoot down enemy missiles and has been tested successfully at the White Sands Missile Range in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But now the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to engage in anti-satellite tests, which could occur as early as this year, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. A duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday there would be no immediate comment on the report. To conduct the tests, the device must be modified so its beams are steady enough to be focused on objects hundreds of miles away. Experts say the modification will be relatively easy, but the laser will have to be tested before anyone knows whether it can actually destroy satellites. It will be tested on old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites, the paper said. The decision to upgrade the laser was made early last month by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, and was reported in the Dec. 19 issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology. However, the military must receive <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval before the device is tested on satellites. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given no indication of his position on the issue. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Piotrowski </PERSON>, commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, has said that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has lasers capable of destroying American satellites and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' lack of such equipment is a `` grave detriment to our national security.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stares </PERSON>, a research associate at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, countered that the planned laser could `` undermine the general improvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet relations, as well as progress in arms control.''

 A family of nine squeezes into an apartment the size of a small studio. Dozens of farmworkers share a single house. Others live in their cars or, worse, in bushes. Housing conditions in 1988 for farmworkers in the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pajaro </LOCATION> valleys about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> were the worst in decades, according to <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials. `` I would say this is probably the worst I've seen in farmworker housing in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from the standpoint of ignoring the health and welfare of the farmworker,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> director of environmental health. `` They're putting them in such extreme conditions _ such as sleeping on top of pesticide sacks, sleeping in caves, sleeping in the bushes, cooking in dirt in the ground, with no water, no toilets,'' he said. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>'s agency is charged with licensing farm labor camps and enforcing health codes. In 1988, he set a record by shutting down five illegal camps, yet he concedes that for every camp he raided, many others went unreported. `` The fact is, there's just going to be more of these extreme substandard housing conditions unless there is more housing developed for the farmworker,'' he said, adding that landlords and labor contractors are scooping up 100 percent profits under current conditions. Conditions are as primitive as any the `` harvest gypsies'' of the Depression era endured, <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said. Inspectors found workers and their families living in garages that were divided only with fabric partitions. Workers at one camp used a discarded bathtub for bathing, building a fire beneath it to warm the water. <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> toured some of the camps last summer and discovered workers living in outhouses. `` It's really a disgrace,'' said <PERSON> Crescencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, a former farmworker and longtime community activist. `` I saw the same situation 20 years ago, and it's worse than it was then. We're going backward.'' Just over a decade ago, the <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> enjoyed a reputation for good working and living conditions following a successful organizing drive by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. Many growers provided camps for workers. But conditions have changed since then, and observers cite several pressures that have combined to create the farmworker housing crisis: _ The federal amnesty program for illegal aliens attracted a larger stream of workers and family members to an area where housing costs are twice the national average. At least two workers competed for every job last summer. Rents can quickly eat up a worker's monthly earnings. A two-bedroom house in <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION> rents for about $ 800 a month, while the minimum wage for farmworkers is $ 5 an hour and most workers take home only about $ 200 to $ 250 a week. _ More families are choosing to live here year-round, filing for unemployment benefits and hoping to find piecework during the off-season. _ The number of licensed labor camps in the county has fallen from more than 200 during the 1970s to 48 as growers and the government have gotten out of the housing business. _ Growers are relying more on independent contractors for their labor supply. The number of contractors in the county has more than tripled in the last three years, according to some estimates, and workers are told a labor contractor's responsibility is to find jobs, not housing.

 Police searched today for the men who shot a 62-year-old mother of 14 to death `` like an animal'' through the front door of her home. <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was shot early Sunday in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> after she refused to let three or four men involved in a dispute with a member of her family into her home, police and family members said. `` Before she could turn around they cut loose,'' said her eldest son, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, 38. `` She was gunned down like an animal. Everyone panicked and started hollering, and the guys ran away.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was shot six times, and police recovered about 14 spent 9mm bullet casings, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON>. No one else was hit. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said four men had come looking for one of his brothers, who had warned his mother not to tell anyone he was home. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said a girlfriend was involved. The shooting was the result of a dispute between the gunmen and a member of Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s family, but was not drug-related, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerecitano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON> said that, as far as police knew, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was `` an innocent victim.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was a retired housekeeper who was widowed six years ago. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the family had expected to gather on New Year's Day for an annual dinner of his mother's specialities _ roast chicken and apple pie. `` She was a good mother,'' he said. `` She did n't drink or smoke or even go out. She was glad that she lived another year. Now, we have to make funeral arrangements ... It's not easy to start the new year like this.''

<HEAD>Armenian Paper Prints Alleged Threat; Activist Calls It a Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An official Armenian newspaper has printed a letter purported to be from Armenian nationalists who threaten to wage terrorist attacks with U.S.-made Stinger missiles if their leaders are not freed from jail. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, an Armenian activist, called the letter a `` total fabrication from beginning to end.'' He said it was another attempt by Soviet officials to discredit people agitating for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian enclave of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Published by the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, the letter demands the immediate release of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a banned group that has led an 11-month campaign for the annexation of the enclave. If the committee's leaders are not freed, the unsigned document says, `` we will have recourse to mass terror ... in our arsenals, we have ` Stingers,' provided by our friends.'' A facsimile copy of the purported document was published in <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>'s Wednesday editions, which reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over the weekend. <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> said the letter was received by law enforcement officials, and labeled `` to be transmitted to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' The letter made no additional reference to the Stingers. Many of the U.S.-made ground-to-air missiles have been shipped by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to insurgents fighting the Soviets in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said the letter may herald a further crackdown by Soviet authorities on the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, seven of whose members are now in jail. The other four reportedly are in hiding to avoid arrest. `` Now that so many members of the committee have been arrested, there is no one to answer these ridiculous charges,'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. `` The press is now closed to anyone from the committee.'' Soviet authorities jailed <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> committee leaders after the Dec. 7 earthquake in northwest <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which killed 25,000 people. Authorities have accused committee members of sabotaging the earthquake relief effort and whipping up ethnic tensions by continuing to seek <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION>'s annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a demand the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has refused. Since February, at least 60 people have been killed in ethnic rioting in mainly Christian Armenian and mainly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Soviets Ban Exports Of Caviar And Other Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT to 1990. Picks up 5th, `It also ...'

<TEXT>
 In an apparent effort to help remedy severe consumer shortages, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced it would ban the export of goods ranging from caviar to children's shoes. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said foreign visitors will be limited to 100 rubles worth of souvenirs. That is $ 166 at the official rate or $ 20 - $ 25 at the black market rate In the report Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the restrictions specifically applied to tourists. The radical changes in export and customs regulations take effect Feb. 1 and last until the end of 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Council of Ministers approved the changes, but did not give a date for the decision. It also did not explain the effect of the ruling on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s attempts to earn scarce hard currency by selling the best caviar, fur hats and coats, vodka and souvenirs in stores that require dollars, pounds or other freely convertible money. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it will be forbidden to export televisions, refrigerators, freezers, washing and sewing machines, children's clothing and shoes, coffee and caviar Coffee is not grown in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the import duty is up to $ 15 a pound. The announcement also said customs duties will climb to 20 to 100 percent of the retail price on vacuum cleaners, mixers, coffee-grinders, irons, radios, cameras, automobile parts and other items. It was not clear if this meant import or export duties. Export limits were imposed recently in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> after complaints that tourists from neighboring Soviet bloc nations were stripping its stores bare of consumer goods. The practice prompted a Soviet economist, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlova-Silvanskaya </PERSON>, to warn in Soviet Culture on Sunday of an impending `` trade war'' among socialist countries. Many Russians travel to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on shopping trips, and Ms. <PERSON> Pavlova-Silvanskaya </PERSON> herself reminisced about trips to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. She said her boss insisted that `` the program had to include a visit to some institution named for <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, lest the Germans or Poles think the citizens of the nation of the Great October Revolution are coming to shop.'' None of the socialist countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has fully convertible currencies, and they trade with each other based on exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting country's cost of production, much less a profit. Ms. <PERSON> Pavlova-Silvanskaya </PERSON> noted that capitalist countries do n't find an invasion of shoppers a problem On Nov. 7, a holiday in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, 100,000 Hungarians went to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and spent $ 42 million in hard currency, she wrote. Rather than limit exports, the Austrians responded to the horde of shoppers with advertisements in Hungarian newspapers, inviting them back on their next day off, Ms. <PERSON> Pavlova-Silvanskaya </PERSON> noted.

<HEAD>One Dead, Two Wounded After Shooting; Thousands Gather in Times Square</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man was shot to death, two others were wounded and at least 52 people were arrested as an estimated 600,000 revelers left Times Square to begin another new year, police said. Crowds began assembling for the Times Square celebration at 6 p.m. Saturday. Police began blocking off streets around about 8:40 p.m.; by 10:30 p.m. people were packed in shoulder-to-shoulder. The revelers counted down the last few seconds before midnight and watched a lighted ball slide down a pole, just as it has most New Year's Eves since 1907. When 1989 arrived, the crowd let loose, uncorking champagne, throwing confetti and even pitching a few bottles. `` Last year was a bad year but next year, I mean this year, is going to be cool,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahura </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said just minutes into the new year. Three men, who were with three friends, were shot early Sunday after arguing with two men who apparently followed them from Times Square, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Tringle </PERSON>, 19, was struck in the heart and died at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Donnel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christoper </PERSON> <PERSON> Betta </PERSON>, 18, was hit three times in the leg and once in the neck, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCroy </PERSON>, 20, was wounded twice in the shoulder and once in the neck, said Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. Both were in satisfactory condition at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, said hospital administrator <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Middendorf </PERSON>. No one was arrested in the shootings. Of the 52 arrests in and around Times Square, 18 were for robbery, nine for grand larceny, one for criminal possession of a weapon, 12 for disorderly conduct, six for assault, four for reckless endangerment and two for menacing, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Thirty-two <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers using eight mechanical brooms, 18 sweepers and three garbage trucks spent the first eight hours of the new year cleaning up the mess left by revelers, said <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Garbage from past New Year's Eve celebrations has averaged about 25 tons a year; this year's debris wo n't be tallied up until Tuesday, when the trucks are weighed, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An African student from <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> has been summarily sentenced to 15 days in prison following a bloody Christmas Eve brawl between Chinese and Africans in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, an African diplomat said today. It was the first report that a second African had been formally arrested in connection with the brawl that left 11 Chinese and two Africans injured. The diplomat, <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>'s first secretary, <PERSON> Gobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON>, also quoted African students as saying that Chinese police stripped and tortured two students from <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> when they attacked 140 mostly African students at a guest house outside <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` We have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in the cold as police poked them with electric cattle prods,'' <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> said. `` They were doing this to make them talk. It appears to be torture.'' The brawl at <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sparked five days of anti-black protests and resulted in most of the city's African students being forced by police to the guest house on Dec. 26. The students had wanted to flee the east-central city for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but were stopped by police at <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s railway station. African students said about 400 Chinese police attacked them Saturday in the guest house and removed about half of them, returning some to their universities and sending others to another hotel. The student witnesses said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police beat and detained seven or eight of their classmates. One witness said police charged the students as loudspeakers broadcast platitudes about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s great friendship with African nations. Another said he saw about seven police beating one student from the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. Chinese news reports said only that a student from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzabaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>, had been arrested and three other students held for questioning. No mention was made of a student from <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> said officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> told him Sunday that student <PERSON> Ludovic </PERSON> <PERSON> Dossoumon </PERSON> had been sentenced without trial to 15 days in prison as `` punishment.'' Chinese authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> refused to specify <PERSON> Dossoumon </PERSON>'s alleged crimes, he said `` They told me the authorities in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> were the only ones who could say anything,'' <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> said. `` This action is unacceptable.'' Chinese authorities at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> said they were `` not clear'' about the arrests. At least 50 students from <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION> remained at the guest house today, apparently because they still wanted to go to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The rest apparently were at another hotel or at their universities. <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province said today that they also were `` not clear'' about the arrests and the exact whereabouts of the students, some of whom were from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A Ghanian diplomat said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had broken an agreement to keep the students at the guest house until a delegation representing nine African countries returned to <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. The delegation came to <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> last Tuesday for negotiations, returned to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and was planning to go again to <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> later this week. `` We do n't know why they broke the agreement,'' said the diplomat, Y.N. <PERSON> Ohene-Akrasi </PERSON>. `` But in light of the apparent police attack this is the least of our concerns.'' Chinese officials in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> have made it clear that no Chinese will be punished for the clash and subsequent demonstrations during which Chinese students destroyed property in African student dormitories and shouted, `` Down with black devils!'' In <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province, a standoff continued between 56 black Africans and Chinese at the <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The students have locked themselves in their dormitory since Dec. 26 because they allege <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials say they have the deadly disease AIDS. College officials have denied the claim. The weeklong incidents in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> are the latest in a series of incidents between Chinese and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1,500 African students, brought here to demonstrate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s solidarity with the Third World. Relations between Chinese and Africans are tense. Chinese are often openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is very different from their own.

 Police blamed overcrowding for the capsizing of a boat packed with revelers planning to watch a New Year's Eve fireworks display off <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. At least 51 people died, and divers searched for other victims today. Authorities today said they would seek homicide charges against those responsible for letting the jammed flat-bottomed craft _ built to hold 100 people _ go out. They said it ignored <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> orders not to sail in Saturday's choppy seas. Survivors said few life jackets were accessible when the 100-foot Bateau Mouche went down Saturday night in 65 feet of water about a mile from shore. One survivor, <PERSON> Plinco </PERSON> <PERSON> Donadio </PERSON>, said, `` I watched my wife die because I could n't untie one of the life preservers to save her.'' As army divers searched the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guanabara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, confusion continued regarding how many people were on the double-decked sightseeing boat Bateau Mouche. Estimates have ranged from 130-150. The passenger list was on the sunken ship, said the company that booked the cruise. Officials gave no estimate of survivors. `` We think the majority of the bodies already have been taken out, but there always is the possibility of finding more,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Albuquerque </PERSON> of the Fire Department's <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Irineu </PERSON> <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON>, a police precinct chief, said he hoped to seek an indictment for homicide. `` We are taking statements from survivors, and they are telling us that something aboard that boat was not right.'' Cid Castor, a director of <LOCATION> Itatitaia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turismo </LOCATION>, which booked the $ 220-per-person cruise, said his travel company had no responsibility for the operation of the outing. `` We are simply ticket sellers,'' said <PERSON> Castor </PERSON>, who said the passenger list was on the ship. The Sol e Mar restaurant, the boat's operator, referred calls to a local lawyer, but no one answered the number given. `` We do n't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it was because of excess capacity,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Oldemiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of the Fire Department's <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The boat had a seven-piece samba band playing on board and tables set for dinner when it capsized. Passenger <PERSON> Fabricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Calo </PERSON>, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said: `` The boat was turning and shifting. Then tables started flying, glass started crashing, and the whole boat just turned over on its side.'' Luxury yachts and smaller boats heading to watch the midnight pyrotechnics display fished survivors from the stormy seas near the base of Sugar Loaf mountain. `` We rescued about 30 people from the sea,'' said <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON>, captain of one vessel, the Casablanca. `` There were people everywhere screaming for help. We took those we could and left the bodies. We could n't take on any more.'' Officials said at least 51 people died. They had no reports of Americans on board. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest private network, <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, quoted maritime specialists saying the boat was not made to withstand Saturday night's choppy sea waters. But the Sol e <PERSON> Mar </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, said Sunday that the boat was `` in perfect mechanical shape.'' According to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Nihaj </PERSON>, who was on the boat with his wife, daughter and five fellow countrymen _ all of whom swam to safety _ there were no adequate life jackets or preservers on board. `` We made it because we were strong and could swim,'' <PERSON> Nihaj </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you were n't in good shape, you simply died.'' <PERSON> Donadio </PERSON>, a photographer who lost his wife and two other relatives, said the life preservers were `` tied onto the railings in the lower part of the boat.'' The vessel was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to return to port, but it ignored the order, <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON> said. Survivors confirmed this account. The cruise boat's captain, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> da Costa, `` did n't want to go out,'' said his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. `` He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he did n't sail. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> died.

 A carload of gang members shouted at a 16-year-old youth, then sprayed him with bullets, in a holiday weekend of shootings that left two dead and capped a record year of gang violence. The death of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 16, was among more than 330 attributed to gang violence in the county in 1988. In 1987, 284 died. At 9 p.m. Friday, about 15 minutes before <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was gunned down, 21-year-old <PERSON> Raymon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was killed in a drive-by attack in the same gang-dominated area of south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The attackers in the two shootings escaped without being identified, police said.

 The imperial family today canceled a traditional post-New Year's appearance for the first time in 21 years, citing Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s grave condition. But the family kept the gates to the palace open, allowing at least 19,000 people to walk through and sign registries by early afternoon. The visitors included 90-year-old <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Muramatsu </PERSON>, who wore a traditional kimono and carried a tattered Japanese flag from World War II. `` I came to pray for the emperor,'' he said. `` I want him to get well and live as long as possible.'' A 23-year-old college student, who visited the palace with her boyfriend, said `` I'm a big fan of the emperor ... to me he's just an old man who is always smiling.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and his immediate family customarily appear on Jan. 2 behind bulletproof glass on a palace balcony in the East Garden before thousands of well-wishers waving paper red-and-white Japanese flags. The emperor's condition was stable today, with his blood pressure at 98 over 42, said a palace official, speaking on condition of anonymity. A normal reading is about 120 over 80. The 87-year-old monarch, who has been bedridden since a serious hemorrhage Sept. 19, suffered internal bleeding early today and received another transfusion, palace sources said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has received 64.4 pints of blood since he fell ill. On Sunday, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received 2.1 pints of blood after a `` substantial'' hemorrhage, palace officials said The imperial family's New Year appearance was last canceled between 1964 and 1968 for a major renovation of the palace. The custom, which began in 1948, was also called off in 1952 because of the death of Empress <PERSON> Taimyo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nonogaki </PERSON> traveled 300 miles from <LOCATION> Aichi </LOCATION> prefecture in east-central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with his 16-year-old son <PERSON> Shinichi </PERSON> to see the registry. `` My son said he would like to see inside the palace and I thought it was important to bring him here, especially now that the emperor is gravely ill,'' said <PERSON> Nonogaki </PERSON>, 48, adding that he wanted his son to learn respect and adoration. `` I believe respecting the head of your country leads to respecting your family and your company on individual level,'' he said.

 Soldiers today demolished the homes of two Palestinians suspected of firebomb attacks and of distributing leaflets urging resistance to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the occupied lands, the army said. Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in towns and refugee camps in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports and hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. In <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> stone-throwers after a woman and a policeman were injured by rocks, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The destruction of the homes in the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> came a day after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> renewed a crackdown on activists by deporting 13 Palestinians to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It was the largest number deported on a single day in the nearly 13-month-old Palestinian uprising. Palestinians in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today shut their businesses and public transportation to protest the expulsions. Six deportees were from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The strike followed the lifting of a 24-hour curfew in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Many violated the curfew Sunday, which Arabs celebrated as the 24th anniversary of the first attack in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, Palestinians set off firecrackers and staged parades in villages Sunday, dancing and waving pictures of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing. The suspects from <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> whose homes were demolished are among nine in the camp detained recently who are active with the Moslem fundamentalist movement `` <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>,'' or `` Zeal,'' an army communique said. The statement did not identify the suspects, but said the group was suspected of involvement in at least two firebombings, one on an army patrol Sept. 26 and the other on a passenger bus Oct. 18. The activists also were accused of participating in riots and distributing <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leaflets, the statement said. The organization is one of the underground groups active in the rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arab news reports said the houses were home to families of 10 and nine people each, and that they were bulldozed without letting families take out belongings such as furniture. At least 345 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has ruled the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The army accused the 13 Palestinians deported on Sunday of being senior leaders of the uprising. Most of them also were members of Palestinian guerrilla groups, the army contended. The most prominent deportee was <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Samhadaneh </PERSON>, 38, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The military accused him of organizing a network of underground popular committees. Since the Palestinian revolt began, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 49 Palestinians and another 12 suspected uprising leaders have received deportation orders, a military spokesman said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for deporting suspected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. In another development, Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> unveiled a sweeping economic recovery plan aimed at halving inflation, now at about 20 percent, by cutting $ 600 million from the nation's budget. A quarter of the cuts would come from defense spending. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who announced the plan Sunday, said his long-range aim was to reduce unemployment, which he said hit 7 percent this year.

 Two peace activists attacked two Dutch air force jets with a sledgehammer, damaging the planes, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed today. The activists, one a former army chaplain, remained in military police custody on this southern <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> air force base where the two NF-5 fighter-bombers were waiting to be flown to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the planes' next owner The suspects were not identified in line with Dutch judicial practice. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said one of them had been a Roman Catholic chaplain in the Dutch army before he quit in the early 1980s to protest deployment by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> of nuclear cruise missiles in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Woensdrecht </ORGANIZATION> air force base, the missiles' planned deployment site, was the scene of numerous anti-nuclear demonstrations before last year's U.S.-Soviet pact eliminating all medium-range nuclear missiles from both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> prevented cruise deployment here. Early Sunday, the two men gained entry to the base by cutting a hole in its perimeter fence, according to the spokesman, who spoke in exchange for anonymity in line with ministry practice. Armed with a sledgehammer and an ax, they did an estimated 50,000 guilders -LRB- $ 25,000 -RRB- damage before they were caught by a military police patrol, according to the spokesman. Dutch air force NF-5s, which have been replaced by supersonic F-16s, are scheduled for delivery to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> later this year. In November, activists daubed eight of them with paint here in a protest against alleged human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 Rival Shiite Moslem militias today fought street battles for a third day in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums and exchanged artillery and mortar fire near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said. Five people were killed and 21 wounded in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where gunmen of the mainstream Amal militia and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> attacked each other with grenades and mortar barrages, police said. Today's casualties brought the overall toll to 12 killed and 29 wounded since a new round of fighting for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s million Shiites began Saturday Amal, Arabic for hope, is backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is supported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Both militias accused each other of starting the clashes. Several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was considering a redeployment of its 4,500 peacekeeping troops in the slums to `` improve their performance and prevent further fighting.'' The fighting was the first serious clash between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> since November, when the two sides fought for six days in west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Forty people were killed and 87 wounded. In May, nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in a three-week battle between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. It was then that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent its troops into the 16-square-mile region comprised mainly of cement shanties. Police said thousands of panicked residents have been huddled in basements and bomb shelters in the embattled districts of <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ghobeiri </PERSON>, Haret Hreik and <PERSON> Mesharafiyeh </PERSON> since New Year's eve. `` I hope 1989 will wipe out all these criminals and let civilized human beings live and breathe safely,'' said <PERSON> Umm </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, a housewife reached by telephone in Haret Hreik. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunners poured mortar fire and Katyusha rockets on each other's strongholds in <LOCATION> Iklim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Tuffah </LOCATION>, or Apple Province. The region stretches from the port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> to the security zone, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its troops following a three-year invasion. A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> communique charged that <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s forces launched a two-pronged, pre-dawn assault from strongholds southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s positions in and around <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safi </LOCATION>, just north of the security zone. `` With God's help, our fighters stood fast and repulsed the assailants after two hours of heavy fighting,'' the communique said. The attackers then `` clamped a siege on the area, preventing food and water supplies from going in,'' it said. The communique said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s fighters in the area were all from the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a loose coalition of Moslem factions locked in guerrilla warfare against Israeli forces in the security zone. A terse Amal communique accused Hezbollah of firing first. Police had no immediate casualty report from the south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> clash, the first in the area since a four-day battle in April that left 62 people killed and 150 wounded.

 <ORGANIZATION> Scandinavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> stepped up security in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and abroad after receiving a terrorist threat, officials said today. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>, the flag carrier of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, received the warning Sunday from <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> police through <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Libya Claims U.S. Allegations Are A Pretext To Kill Gadhafi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official Libyan news agency claimed today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using allegations about a chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a pretext to launch an attack and kill Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, referred to a report Sunday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> that quoted unidentified <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources as saying the Americans planned to send a `` hit squad'' to kill the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader during an attack. <PERSON> Al-Khaleej </PERSON> claimed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> task force had trained in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for the attack, which it said could come this month. The newspaper said the strike would include bombing attacks on the nuclear research center at <LOCATION> Tajura </LOCATION> and the alleged chemical weapons plant at <LOCATION> Rabtah </LOCATION>. The newspaper report had no dateline but appeared to originate in the Libyan capital, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> gave the report unusual attention, not only carrying a story but also sending it to foreign news agencies by telex and telefax. `` The uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals and exposes clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hysterical campaign'' against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the report proves the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations about a chemical weapons plant `` were excuses and pretexts for an operation of premeditated individual murder.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has contended <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is on the verge of producing chemical weapons at the plant near <LOCATION> Rabtah </LOCATION>, a city about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> insists the facility is a pharmaceutical plant. West German officials are investigating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that a West German company played a key role in helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build the plant. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had discussed with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries the possibility of military action against the plant. `` We are confident that the public opinion after knowing these facts will stand on our side ...,'' said <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the Al-Khaleej report. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly has carried denials by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s government that the plant produces chemical weapons as well as statements of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s commitment to treaties to ban such weapons On Christmas Eve, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> offered to return the body of an American pilot killed in the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. He also called for the release of two French children held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They were later freed. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> has carried frequent stories on `` massive demonstrations'' in <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> cities to denounce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threats and show support for the government. On Monday, it said a group it called the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in Defense of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> condemned the sailing of a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 13-ship carrier battle group for the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> called the sailing a routine deployment of the 6th Fleet. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said the new group comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Israel Criticized Over Deportations, Foreign Ministers to Meet in

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top Cabinet minister said today that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s latest deportation of Palestinians violates human rights, obstructs <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts and runs counter to the Jewish state's own interests. The criticism coincided with the disclosure that the Egyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign ministers will meet in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Sunday. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the only Arab state that has diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, took <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to task in a statement to reporters on the expulsion of 13 Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The action Sunday brought to 49 the number of Palestinians deported since an uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began Dec. 8, 1987. Egyptian leaders condemned earlier deportations in terms similar to those used today by <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>. As <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> spoke, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> next Sunday with his Israeli counterpart, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. It will be their first meeting since <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, a member of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, took the foreign affairs portfolio in the Cabinet formed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> last month. The last meeting at this level took place about three months ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between Abdel-Meguid and <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foreign minister <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is now finance minister. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> will meet during a Jan. 7-11 international conference on the prevention of chemical weapons that both ministers are attending in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> viewed the deportations as `` violations of the human rights of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and a negative stance that obstructs the -LRB- <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> -RRB- peace process.'' He said the expulsions also `` encourage extremist tendencies among the various parties and conflict with the interests of the Israeli people in taking advantage of available opportunities and a new climate for peace efforts.'' This apparently referred to last month's peace strategy announced by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renounced what he said was all forms of terrorism and offered to hold peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> within the framework of an international conference. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>State Department Official, House Panel Member Disagree on Cuba</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Torricelli in graf 7, Torricelli said.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> disagreed today on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs a new policy on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think we need a new policy. I think the policy's working,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs `` It's a policy of putting pressure on -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to isolate him, to make his economic situation more difficult, to try to force him out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, to try to force him to make human rights concessions. That's what's working,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Good Morning America.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, interviewed on the same program, said `` to have an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy that is basically based on the idea that we wish the revolution did n't happen, we wish that he'd go away, is really foolish going into a fourth decade.'' <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> said he thinks a policy is needed that would require some reforms from <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in exchange for an improved relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a policy that `` puts a real price on a new relationship, a real price on his policies in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and human rights at home. We may find that that gets some results.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution, said in a televised speech Sunday night that it is `` socialism or death'' for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, as he rejected market-oriented economic reforms. His remarks seemed aimed at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Communist countries that have been abandoning strict adherence to Marxist doctrine. <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> said that `` despite the rhetoric, I think there's some reason to believe there can be change.'' He said `` the difficulty here is that he does n't understand what necessarily is required for better relations. And what -LRB- President-elect -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be doing is spelling that out exactly. We want some change of policy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, we want him to continue to adhere to not aiding violent revolution in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we want the Angolan accords fulfilled, we want his promises kept on immigration, we want human rights changes in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> wants a changed relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` probably his first real step has got to be implementing'' the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> agreement `` and taking the troops out.'' But, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, he thinks <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is `` a first generation communist leader ... who is unable to countenance a reduction in his personal power, real democracy, real change. It will take the next generation coming, I think, for there to be real change in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> returned to television today after a two-year absence with a show broadcast from the living room of their borrowed home to a handful of stations around the country. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said as the show began. Sporting her trademark heavy eye makeup, she began crying two minutes into the hourlong show. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, the founder of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, left his television ministry in March 1987 in the midst of a sex and money scandal. He and his wife had not appeared on a television pulpit since January 1987. Today, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers and his supporters crowded into the house that his last television appearance was to break ground for the <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the home of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe that was the last straw for Satan,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` I think the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built. ... I believe the devil said, ` I have to smash <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he believes that church, which was designed to hold 30,000 people, still will be built. But since the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> left the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> organization, it has filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws, and last month a bankruptcy judge ordered its assets sold to a Canadian businessman. Also last month, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and a former top aide were indicted on charges including fraud and conspiracy. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> thanked a supporter who had donated the money to put him back on the air, and said the program would be carried by more stations next month. It is scheduled to be shown Monday through Friday. `` We bought time,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` We had a certain amount of money and that's all the time we could buy, and it's not a lot of money, but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did not make any direct appeal for donations, in marked contrast to his old `` ` PTL Club'' show. He did give an address in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, `` if you want to write us.'' Callers to a telephone number _ not toll-free _ shown throughout the show were asked to give their name, phone number and address but got no appeal for funds. The callers were invited to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> to pray for them. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who turned 49 today, said the program was being carried by television stations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, WOCD general manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuenschel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> paid `` the usual rate per hour'' to be on the station. He would n't say what that was. The station has a 30-day contract for the show. He said he will keep the show on `` as long as they keep paying.'' The only mention of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s legal troubles came when the guest on the show, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> songwriter <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, said he wrote one song in a lawyer's office. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` did n't know anything about lawyers.'' `` Oh no-o-o-o,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said with a chuckle. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he had a message for `` hurting people'' and that viewers should keep their faith no matter what crisis they were facing. `` If <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> can survive their holocaust of the last two years, then you can make it,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Home of Cricket Considering Female Pavilion Admission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The home of cricket is taking the first step toward opening its most sacred doors to women. In a newsletter to its 18,000 members, the <ORGANIZATION> Marylebone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cricket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> asked the question unheard in its 202-year history: `` Should <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> consider the election of lady members?'' Marylebone is one of just two men-only clubs left in top-flight English cricket. Women can watch cricket at <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, the club's headquarters, but not from the Pavilion, which is limited to members only. Not even women accompanying male members are allowed. The newsletter noted that <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s national women's cricket team even had played matches at Lord's and that the Pavilion and club-like <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> had been opened to women on those occasions. `` As we approach the 21st centruy, should this ` progress' be taken further?'' the newsletter asked. It also sought to reassure diehard supporters of the men-only rules that no women members were likely anytime soon, not with a waiting list of about 8,000. `` With the current waiting list, none would be elected for some time but should we allow ladies to watch some cricket from the Pavilion, either as members or as guests of members?'' the newsletter asked. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Lancashire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cricket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> voted to remain all-male, defeating a proposal to allow women members.

<HEAD>Medvedev's Works, Except Criticism of Solzhenitsyn, to Be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unofficial historian says he would like to dispute some of the writings of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> but the work of the Nobel Prize-winning author of `` The Gulag Archipelago'' remains off-limits in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the interview published Sunday in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> did not detail his criticism of <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>. Both writers have examined the Russian Revolution and the mass repression of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solzhenitzyn </PERSON>'s three-volume `` Gulag'' is a detailed chronicle of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s labor camps. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, who is widely known abroad but has seen his own articles published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> only in the past year, said negotiations are under way to publish all or parts of many of his own books, including works on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and on his successors, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The journal <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION> plans to publish the first part of his new book on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, `` Let History Judge,'' in its first issue this year, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. The entire book is slated for `` express'' production by Progress Publishers. But <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said there is still no chance for the one book he would really like to publish here, titled `` Polemics with <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>.'' It consists of six or seven critical essays on the basic works of <LOCATION> Solzhenitsyn </LOCATION>. `` It's too bad that everything connected with this writer remains a closed area,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` We mine gold from dirt and rock, picking out the best, washing to find the gold,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` It's the same here. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> must be published. And criticized.'' Soviet intellectuals have called for publication of <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s works. But the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ideology chief, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, said in November that publishing `` Gulag Archipelago'' and <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s history of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s life just before the Russian Revolution `` would undermine the foundations on which today's life rests.'' The ideology chief, who is not related to the historian, said <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s writing `` radically contradicts our social and political system, our understanding of the world, of history, our attitude toward <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> traces <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s widescale repression back to <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, who is revered in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said his books `` The Troubled Spring of 1918,'' on the beginning of the Soviet Civil War and the socialist system, and another on `` Those Who Stood Around Stalin'' also are scheduled for publication.

 Chinese paramilitary forces beat and used electric truncheons on African students during a five-hour attack on 140 foreign students at a <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> guest house, witnesses said Monday. An African diplomat, <PERSON> Gobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, also reported allegations that Chinese militiamen stripped and administered electric shocks to students during Saturday's attack. `` We have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in the cold as police poked them with electric cattle prods,'' <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> said. `` They were doing this to make them talk. It appears to be torture.'' <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> also said a <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> student had been sentenced, without trial, to 15 days in prison following a bloody Dec. 24 clash between <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and Africans in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. It was the first report a second African had been arrested in with the brawl that left 11 Chinese and two Africans injured. The fight between Chinese and African students at <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> touched off five days of anti-black protests in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province. A student from <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> said he saw Chinese forces at the guest house Saturday using the electric prods all over the the foreigners' bodies, including their genitals `` They put their electric sticks everywhere but mostly on our sexes,'' said <PERSON> Daouda </PERSON> <PERSON> Diakite </PERSON>, a 24-year-old student at <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Luckily, I succeded in defending myself. I had friends around me.'' `` They treated us like animals,'' said another African, student at the <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` They used an electric baton on my face.'' A Japanese student at <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the police were `` brutal'' but she said she did not see them use their electric batons. None of the allegations could be independently confirmed. An American TV crew outside the guest house during the attack was prevented from entering. Chinese authorities say they are `` not clear'' about what happened at the guest house. The problems in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and in another <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> city, <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, are the latest in a series of incidents between Chinese and 1,500 African students brought here to demonstrate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s solidarity with the Third World. Relations between the two have been tense. Chinese are often openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that is very different than their own. Chinese and African students fought at <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION> on Christmas Eve after gatekeepers refused to allow two <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women to attend a dance given by black African students. Anti-black protests followed and most of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s 139 African students fled to the <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> train station. They wanted to go to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but were stopped by about 150 police. On Dec. 26, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, a paramilitary group, forced the students to the guest house. The following day, diplomats from nine <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries came to <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> to speak with the students. An agreement was made to keep the students in the guest house until the diplomats returned this week, according to Y.N. <PERSON> Ohene-Akrasi </PERSON>, minister counsellor at the <ORGANIZATION> Ghanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. But on Saturday, the Chinese broke the agreement, he said. African students said about 400 Chinese militiamen attacked the students in the guest house. Students fought off the Chinese, throwing plates at them from the dining hall, but soon realized that they were outnumbered, <PERSON> Diakite </PERSON> said. The students then agreed to leave the dining hall and gather in a courtyard. One African witness at <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> said police charged the students, and another said he saw about seven police beating one student from the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. `` I saw people, only men, naked, being shocked by the Chinese and their weapons,'' <PERSON> Diakite </PERSON> said. `` They shocked women, too, though. Also on their sexes.'' Witnesses said Chinese `` arrested'' six to eight African students from <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION>. Chinese reports said one Ghanian student, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzabaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>, had been arrested and three other students held for questioning. No mention was made of a student from <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> diplomat said that on Sunday officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> told him student <PERSON> Ludovic </PERSON> <PERSON> Dossoumon </PERSON> had been sentenced to 15 days in prison as `` punishment'' without trial. Chinese authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> refused to specify <PERSON> Dossoumon </PERSON>'s alleged crimes, <PERSON> Mamah </PERSON> said `` They told me the authorities in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> were the only ones who could say anything,'' he said. Chinese authorities at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> said they were `` not clear'' about the arrests. On Monday, at least 50 students from <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION> remained at the guest house, apparently because they still wanted to go to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Those who had n't been returned to their schools apparently had been moved to another hotel. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province, a standoff continued between 56 black Africans and Chinese at the <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The students have locked themselves in their dormitory since last week because they allege <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials say they all have AIDS. College officials have denied the claim.

 The 100th Rose Parade got under way today with floats that showed off Polynesian dancers, a grateful <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> refugee and a couple who exchanged wedding vows in front of 1 million spectators and a TV audience estimated at 300 million. Halfway across the nation, 650 pompon dancers opened today's Cotton Bowl parade in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a flashier event than in previous years as the city sought to make the pageant competitive with the Rose and Orange parades Half a million people jammed downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to watch floats, stars, bands and 20 circus elephants in the 55th Annual King Orange Jamboree Parade on New Year's Eve. And 22,000 marchers _ some dressed as rabbits, Mexican senoritas or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisins _ strutted their stuff in snow for 52,700 hardy spectators of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s 89th annual Mummers parade. People began lining the 5 -LCB- - mile parade route Saturday morning Police Lt. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> called the crowd better behaved than last year's. As of 8 a.m. 177 people had been arrested, most for drunkenness. The parade began promptly at 8 a.m. under picture-perfect, sunny skies and temperatures warming into the 60s. The grand marshal was <ORGANIZATION> Shirley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION>, 60, who enjoyed the same honor 50 years ago when she was <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s child acting sensation. Black recently admitted she's allergic to roses, and she had plenty to sneeze at: more than 20 million roses, chrysanthemums, orchids, carnations, marigolds, irises, daffodils, tulips and other blooms. The first Rose Parade was held in 1890, when the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> treated the town to a rose-petal-covered procession of horse-and-buggy teams. The 1989 edition featured 275 horses, 20 marching bands and 60 floats _ including its tallest ever, a 70-foot creation depicting a roller-skating giraffe pulling a giant calliope. It won a trophy for the most original float. On a float dubbed `` Romance in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carie </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>, 23, recited wedding vows before what was said to be the largest audience ever to witness a marriage ceremony. Some of the TV audience of 300 million watched the festivies wearing special 3-D <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> glasses. Vietnamese refugee <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, riding the Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> float, said: `` I feel very great. I'm really happy. It's the best New Year's I have ever had.'' Eighteen floats won trophies. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Mardi Gras,'' depicting a giant masked reveler with a 26-foot headdress, was the Sweepstakes winner as the most beautiful float. Rose Queen <PERSON> Charmaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shryock </PERSON> traveled with her court in a float followed by another reuniting many former Rose Queens, including 80-year-old <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsted </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthis </PERSON>, who was the parade's monarch in 1930 After the parade, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> were to meet in the Rose Bowl. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a float containing a 24-foot rabbit popping out a magician's hat won the theme prize for the bigger-than-ever Cotton Parade. It was an appropriate symbol for the event, which organizers hoped to jazz up by tripling the pageant's 1989 budget to $ 225,000. Some 100,000 spectators gathered for the parade under overcast skies and 55-degree weather, and millions more watched an hour of the event on TV. `` We have a one-hour shot to show that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is not in the dumps,'' said parade chairman <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> Lay. Thirteen floats, three giant balloon figures, 15 bands and five equestrian units followed a new route mapped to avoid shadows from downtown buildings. The grand marshal was country singer <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pride </PERSON>. Following the parade, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, will square off in the Cotton Bowl. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> plays the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> in the Orange Bowl tonight, but <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had its parade New Year's Eve. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemsley </PERSON>, star of TV's `` Amen,'' wore flashing sunglasses and was backed up by three female singers on a float celebrating <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and electricity. Other celebrity participants included actor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, `` L.A. Law'' star <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttan </PERSON> and `` Cheers'' star <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garagiola </PERSON> were the masters of ceremonies. Philadelphians lining the 2 -LCB- - mile Mummers parade route on New Year's Day were treated to 14 hours of string bands competing for more than $ 286,000 in prize money and clowns who cakewalked to the event's perennial theme, `` Oh, Dem Golden Slippers. Mummery, the prancing and wearing of masks and costumes for the sheer fun of it, traces its origins back 2,400 years to the Greek god Momus. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the first formal parade was in 1901, but neighborhood parades go back to at least 1877. Some clowns wore traditional garb, but others dressed more topically, suiting up as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and talk show hosts <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>. `` Anything goes in this parade,'' said <PERSON> Philadelphian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, attending her 20th Mummers parade. About 50 miles to the southwest, tiny <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, spoofed the <ORGANIZATION> Mummers </ORGANIZATION> with its Hummers Parade despite rain and snow. About 200 spectators were entertained by 100 marchers, including participants dressed as <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, Father Time and Baby 1989.

 The 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ceremonially convenes for its bicentennial session on Tuesday, firmly in the hands of Democrats waiting to see whether the incoming <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president will be more conciliatory than the departing one. `` We both know there will be things on which we ca n't agree,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said after a post-election meeting with president-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he added that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` a realist'' interested in forging a better link with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Capitol Hill-White House relationship will be tested throughout the year as lawmakers grapple with the obstinate problem of the federal budget deficit and seek to map a new path for domestic and foreign policy. But the first difficult item to confront lawmakers will be whether to give themselves as much as a $ 45,000 pay raise. While there is some new leadership on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ most prominently <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> as the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader _ the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will look a lot like the last one. Better than 98 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents and 92 percent of sitting senators who sought re-election will return for another term. This year's freshman class is the smallest in history. Eleven new senators _ five Democrats and six Republicans _ will take the oath of office as the first order of business when the chamber convenes. The number includes Republican Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, appointed to replace vice-president elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was resigning before his Jan. 20 inauguration to let Coats be sworn in early. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 33 freshmen will be sworn in, 17 Democrats and 16 Republicans. They include <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who played `` Cooter'' on TV's `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' mountain climber <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., and attorney and political novice <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Machtley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Republican who knocked off scandal-tainted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> veteran <ORGANIZATION> Fernand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, will be re-elected to a second term as speaker, despite two ethics investigations into his finances and his alleged disclosure of classified information. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s first-day speech to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will set the tone for the new session It is a day not of substance, but of ceremony. The visitors galleries on both sides of the Capitol will be filled with lawmakers' families. There will be socializing, picture taking and handshaking. A few routine housekeeping details will be taken care of in both chambers, including the organizing of committees and the adoption of rules. Tuesday's ceremonies and festivities will be followed by the formal counting of presidential electoral votes on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will convene, then march as a body across the long corridor to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber. There, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ acting in his constitutional role as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ will open the certificates sent in from each state, announce them in alphabetical order, and declare himself the winner. After two days in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will leave again, and not come back until Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. Real business gears up the following week, and while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may enjoy a limited `` honeymoon'' period, partisan struggle lurks not far below the surface. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first challenge will be to outline for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his budget priorities and to show how he would save the $ 32 billion or so necessary to meet deficit-reduction targets. He has pledged to do it without raising taxes, and <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been skeptical about whether that can be accomplished. For their part, Democrats will be anxious to set their own policy course in many areas. With a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a one-seat gain from last year, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at 260-175, three better than the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the majority party believes it has as much a mandate as the new president. Leading the way will be two new <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairmen: <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., in the Other new chairmanships will go to Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., at the Banking committees; former Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, as head of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations; and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., In addition to the budget, another early and difficult issue for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be where to set its own pay. A presidential commission has recommended 50 percent salary hikes for lawmakers and some 2,500 other top government officials in the executive and judicial branches. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget, due on Capitol Hill Jan. 9, will likely include an increase. If both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> do not vote to stop it, whatever <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recommends will automatically take effect on Feb. 8. House leaders have said they plan to let the raise happen, but have promised to expedite a ban on honoraria, the special-interest speaking fees earned by many legislators. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees also will face the immediate task of holding confirmation hearings on members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cabinet and other top administration appointees. Hearings on former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination to be Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> have been tentatively scheduled for Inauguration week, and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to hold early hearings on <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s nomination as Secretary of State The 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is called the bicentennial <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because it will be meeting during the 200th anniversary of the date when the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was finally able to muster a quorum and officially convene on April 6, 1789.

<HEAD>Cable Prices Going Up Along With Wider Choice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cable television systems are offering more channels to more viewers, but the price for watching is also going up. In the two years since most cable systems were freed from municipal rate regulation, their basic service rates have risen substantially. However, stability in premium channel rates, which were never regulated, has moderated the increase in the average overall cable bill. The Consumer Price Index for the 12 months through November shows that cable TV bills for urban viewers rose 13.3 percent, while the overall index rose 4.2 percent during the period. The cable increase during the previous year was 6.85 percent. Other trackers of cable prices, however, show different figures. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Associates </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, research firm that compiles nationwide cable prices, says the monthly rate for basic cable rose about 10 percent, from a monthly average of $ 13.20 last year to $ 14.52 in 1988. With premium channels added in, average monthly cable bills rose 5.6 percent over 1987 to $ 24.73, a rate only slightly higher than inflation, the firm says. Those in the industry say that for the two decades before deregulation took effect in January 1987, municipalities kept basic service rates artificially low. With the freedom to charge what the market will bear, cable systems have added more channels to the basic tier and raised prices. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Armbrust </PERSON>, a senior analyst at <LOCATION> Kagan </LOCATION>, said the trend in steep increases for basic service is a `` two-year phenomenon'' that already shows signs of stabilizing. `` Regular rates will track fairly closely with inflation and perhaps outpace it simply because of the new services'' being added, she said. `` There could be a consumer backlash if charges go up without new services, but cable operators are sensitive to this. It's a subscription service _ you vote every month whether to buy it.'' For some systems, rates are still taking healthy leaps upward. Cable TV <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is raising its monthly rate for basic service _ 54 channels _ by 11.1 percent to $ 19.95. That increase comes on top of an 18 percent increase last August. Media General Cable of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is raising its rate for basic service of 83 channels by nearly 19 percent to $ 18.95. It last raised its rates a year ago. On the more moderate side, <ORGANIZATION> TeleCommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cable company operating systems with more than 4 million subscribers, says it will raise its basic monthly rates an average of 7 percent in 1989, to an average $ 15.50 So far, consumers appear to be doing little more than shrugging their shoulders at the increases. The number of homes subscribing to cable service grew this year by about 8 percent to 48.6 million _ representing 53.8 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television households. About 80 percent of all homes are wired for cable. `` People value television choice in their home, they want to have a lot of channels and they're willing to pay for it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, vice president of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based consulting firm. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> <PERSON> Anstrom </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says cable packs a lot of entertainment value for the price. `` Rates are increasing, but if you look at the overall universe, cable is priced quite reasonably,'' he said. `` For about 50 cents a day, the average cable subscriber receives 35 channels. It's a good entertainment buy.'' These arguments have been made to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but have failed to assure some, including Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that consumers' interests rather than a bottom line are being served by cable companies. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> plans to introduce legislation in the upcoming session to strengthen the ability of cities to regulate cable rates, said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Correia </PERSON>, an aide to the senator. The deregulation that took hold in 1987 precluded rate regulation in virtually every metropolitan area under the theory that systems in heavily populated areas face competition from other media sources, including many over-the-air broadcast signals. But, <PERSON> Correia </PERSON> said, even in metropolitan areas, cable can lock out competition by refusing to sell its programming to other sources, like wireless cable and backyard satellite dishes. `` It's the worst of both worlds. You have monopolies but you have no ability to regulate them,'' he said. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based communications lawyer who represents municipalities on cable issues, also characterizes cables operators as monopolies based on their pricing practices. `` They price based on what people are willing to pay, not what it costs them to deliver the service,'' he said.

 The man wearing the visitor card around his neck carried a large framed poster showing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> above a 1989 calendar. `` I dream of a kinder and gentler nation,'' read the caption. Alas, politicos and souvenir hunters trying to capture a little of the bicentennial inaugural spirit will not get a chance to buy that poster. Like the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> salad plate, the red-white-and-blue pompons, the horned hat and the one that ballooned into something resembling the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> doughboy, it did not pass muster with the Presidential Inaugural Committee. `` Everything in here is eminently tasteful,'' promotion director <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said of the 16-page commemorative catalog due for mailing this week to 1.5 million Republicans, historians and collectors. In other inauguration news, with less than three weeks to I-Day: _ The Fresh-Up Lounge, a 20-year tradition, announced it will once again serve `` the grooming and personal needs of media men and women'' covering the inaugural Those needs apparently range from haircuts, Band-Aids and food to a Color Vision Computer. `` See yourself in a variety of hair colors,'' urges the press release issued by sponsors <ORGANIZATION> Clairol </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bristol </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. _ Nearly 2,200 bottles of <LOCATION> Korbel </LOCATION> champagne, the official champagne of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inauguration, were delivered to inaugural headquarters -LRB- Official inaugural candy bars are in the works -RRB-. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to perform at a musical prelude to the Jan. 20 inaugural ceremony _ The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will make special I-Day stamp cancellations in six cities _ <LOCATION> Milton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Why? Hint: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born in the first and raised in the second, started a business in the third and vacations in the fourth; the last two have something to do with Vice President-elect <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. _ Some 60,000 invitations to inaugural events are out, gone, finis That leaves a mere 400,000 to mail, but there's no rush. They're commemoratives that wo n't admit anyone to anything. `` I've seen them framed on walls all over the country,'' insists committee spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> `` They are extremely popular.'' For those who are n't even on the commemorative list, the inaugural catalog offers consolations ranging in price from 95 cents to $ 1,195. The cheapest item is a schoolbook cover depicting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in keeping with the inaugural's bicentennial `` George To George'' theme. At the top end of the scale, devotees can purchase eagles _ $ 1,195 for <LOCATION> Steuben </LOCATION> glass or <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON> china. For couch potatoes and the politically unconnected, the committee is offering for $ 29.95 a VCR tape that promises buyers the inaugural bicentennial `` captured for years of enjoyment and historical significance.'' Hollywood producer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, is making the tape. Half of the one-hour tape will be historical and the other half will hit the high points of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> inauguration, according to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, executive director of the committee. He said all schools in the country will be given a copy. For the tradition-bound, the catalog offers the usual medals _ ranging from $ 29.50 for a bronze art medal to $ 920 for a collectors' set _ and inaugural license plates, available for $ 50 and usable in any state until March 31 But not everything in the catalog is generic. Some items have been chosen to reflect the incoming president's tastes and background _ horseshoe belt buckles and key rings, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chili mix and coasters made of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> slate; golf shirts and Navy-style caps like the ones he wears. You wo n't find official inaugural dried pork rinds. You will find commemorative blazer buttons, but officials strenuously deny that they are there to recall <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s preppie image _ a distinct liability early in his White House campaign. No, blazer buttons have an important place in inaugural history. Seems <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> wore special buttons engraved with the arms of the new government at his inaugural ceremony. This year's set, 10 brass buttons for $ 65, is engraved with the bicentennial inaugural seal. Most of the cost of the inauguration _ expected to top $ 20 million _ will come from ball and gala ticket sales. But the committee hopes to net more than $ 2 million from its catalog items.

 One hundred professors and other prominent personalities have signed a petition asking the government for open elections to parliament in 1989, spokesmen for the group said Monday. The petition, presented to the government ombudsman's office Dec. 30 and given to Western news agencies, said that any citizen should have the right to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, after being nominated by a certain portion of eligible voters. For example, the group said, signatures by 1 percent of a district's electorate could be sufficient to nominate a candidate. Under <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s current arrangement, nominations to parliament elections are controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which in effect determines how many seats go to communists, to allied political parties and to non-party members. Communists have always received an automatic majority of the seats since the party consolidated power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after World War II and held the first postwar parliament elections in 1947. Elections are planned this year after the drafting of a new election law. Deputies serve four-year terms and the last elections were held in October 1985. In his New Year's Eve message to the nation, Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said he would like the new parliament to `` more clearly reflect the natural differentiation of attitudes and views within society.'' Among those signing the petition to the ombudsman were film director <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>; the rector of <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bialkowski </PERSON>; the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Paszczynski </PERSON>; and leader of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Zulawski </PERSON>.

 Where most people list their job experiences, <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s resume brags, `` Arrested 26 times in seven cities.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> complains it's out-of-date. `` It might be closer to 30 right now,'' the 29-year-old activist said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where the latest protests against abortion are being planned. Since its national debut at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last summer, Operation Rescue has made abortion a high-profile issue again. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion clinics throughout the country, lying in front of doors until police carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> says he is trying to produce the `` social tension'' necessary to change abortion laws by using the non-violent 1960s civil rights protest as a model. `` He's the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of a movement,'' said <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brignola </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> lawyer and footsoldier in the anti-abortion drive. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s critics claim Operation Rescue, so named because followers try to `` rescue'' the unborn, is an assault on women's rights `` The civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people. They're trying to take away the rights of living, breathing human beings,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. More than 450 anti-abortion demonstrators clogged <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> jails during the five-day Democratic convention. Since then, demonstrations have spread to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and still more cities. The activists want the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions. An estimated 1.6 million women have abortions each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Standing at the forefront of Operation Rescue is a used car salesman who once wanted to be a rock star. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, began their crusade in 1984 by standing in front of abortion clinics, trying to talk women out of entering. Friends soon joined them, and the couple opened an office that offered women free pregnancy tests and hand-me-down baby clothes. `` God clicked a light on in my head and said it was n't enough to just be against child-killing, that I had to do something about it,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who's selling his auto dealership because he is too busy with Operation Rescue. Critics concede <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has a mesmerizing personality. He even tries to convert relatives at family reunions, said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, his aunt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was reared in a low-key Protestant environment but quit high school at 17, dreaming of a career in music, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, who is communications director for the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> chapter of Planned Parenthood, a medical service that anti-abortion pickets frequently target. She stressed that she does not speak for the organization about her nephew. `` He went away and he flipped out,'' she said about <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s transformation into a born-again Christian `` He came back a totally changed personality. It was more like a cult reaction than a spiritual quest.'' Marriage and his highly public role as Operation Rescue spokesman have calmed him somewhat, she said. The Terrys have one child and three foster children. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> dismisses his aunt's comments _ including her assessment that `` he's an egomaniac,'' lapping up news media attention. To <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, Operation Rescue is nothing new She said anti-abortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and glued the clinic's door shut four or five times. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s first arrest came in January 1986 when he chained himself to a sink at the clinic, which performs abortions. He was jailed for 22 days for refusing to pay a $ 60 fine. `` It does n't matter what you say to him. There is no reason involved,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` He does n't care about women. I think he really hates women.'' Iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION> clinic. A court order keeps the nearly ever-present demonstrators at shouting distance. `` They really want to make it personal,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. Even when she has run into him on a Saturday in the post office, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has shouted at her, `` How many babies did you murder today?'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> criticizes the anti-abortion movement as being `` too nice'' during the 1980s, pacified by the presence of an ideological friend like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> into not working hard for its goal. `` We cry that abortion is murder, it's child-killing, and yet we carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters,'' he said. `` That's not an adequate response to murder. A logical response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the victim.'' The lean, bushy-haired <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> expects and even hopes his demonstrators will be arrested. He claims Operation Rescue was responsible for 11,000 arrests in 1988 and predicts 500,000 will be arrested in 1989. There are no situations, he said, when abortions are justified. `` In most areas of life it's OK for people to follow their own beliefs, but not when it comes to having innocent children murdered,'' he said. `` That's like saying, ` Why ca n't a white man follow his own conscience concerning owning a black slave? Why ca n't a German follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot Jews?''' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> has attracted some prominent supporters, including former presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who said he backs `` any means short of violence'' to stop abortion. If anti-abortion demonstrators set their minds to it, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said, they could change abortion laws in six months because the political system is not built to deal with mass protests. Yard dismisses <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> as a `` puppet'' groomed for the role of point man in the latest anti-abortion offensive. `` Women are really outraged by the whole thing,'' she said. `` The reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings -LRB- of abortion clinics -RRB- and Operation Rescue is that people do n't believe <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> can be overturned. ... I'm not so sanguine. All I know is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can.'' At Operation Rescue's office, a competing outcry is being plotted. Pinned to the wall is a large map of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with `` abortion mills'' dotted in red. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> distractedly complains to a staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will take him to a television appearance. As a photographer snaps pictures, he removes his foot from his desk, saying `` that's too casual for someone trying to change world history.'' He adds, chuckling: `` It's comical, really. I think God has a sense of humor. Do n't you think it's rather funny that a former used car salesman is heading such a movement?''

<HEAD>U.N. Official Says Africa Falling Behind Developed Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Almost all African nations were falling further behind the world's developed countries, the executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Adebayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adedeji </PERSON>, also called for fundamental changes in structural adjustment programs mandated by major lending institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Structural adjustment programs usually require significant economic belt-tightening by nations receiving <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> aid, and debtor nations frequently complain the measures often lead to hardship and civil unrest. <PERSON> Adebayo </PERSON>, delivering a year-end assessment to an audience of diplomats and economists at the commission's headquarters in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, said <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economy did not keep pace with its population growth in 1988. He predicted an even more dismal decline in 1989. <PERSON> Adebayo </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s combined economy grew at a rate of 2.5 percent in 1988, compared with 1.3 percent in 1987. However, he said, that was offset by population growth of about 3 percent. A decade-long pattern of slow economic growth coupled with rapid population increases has left the average African with an income only about 80 percent of what it was in 1980, <PERSON> Adebayo </PERSON> said. He noted that demand for African exports remains weak and said the continent's economy `` has been sapped and weakened by the burden of debt in spite of the perceptible recovery of the industrial economies.'' He put the combined debt of African nations at $ 230 billion at the close of 1988, compared with $ 218 billion in 1987. <PERSON> Adebayo </PERSON> said improved weather conditions that put an end to droughts in many parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1988 were expected to continue in 1989, but that resulting improvements in agriculture were likely to be offset by further declines in commodity prices. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s basic agricultural exports are coffee, tea, cocoa and vegetable oils.

<TEXT>
 A suspect in the New Year's Eve shooting of a <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy sheriff was `` pinned down'' this morning in a cabin near here and fired shots at an officer's car, authorities said. Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said shots were exchanged with one of two suspects in the fatal shooting of Deputy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Varner </PERSON>, but no one was hit. The owner of the cabin, who does not live there full time, called police this morning after he went to the cabin `` and recognized that something was amiss,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> died today at <ORGANIZATION> Barrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, where he was taken after being shot Saturday night after two men opened fire during a routine traffic stop, authorities said. The man inside the house is believed to be <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savory </PERSON>, 45, who also is known as <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savorey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Toad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. He said the man is armed with at least one automatic weapon. The other suspect, identified earlier as <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, about 25, is not at the cabin. The two were believed to have split up earlier, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. Savory told a couple who were victimized by the two suspects after the shooting Saturday that he was a survivalist and `` do n't believe in hurting people, but there are times when it's necessary. The two had approached the home of Bud and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, pretending to have car trouble, and then tied up the two and took their car. The Hunts were not injured. After DPS and <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities arrived at the cabin today, shots were fired from the house at a sheriff's patrol car, but no one was injured, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. He said Interstate 40 was closed in both directions about 3 miles east of <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION> because the cabin where the man is holed up `` is only a few hundred yards from the highway.'' The cabin was surrounded and that at least two helicopters were being used to help keep the building under surveillance. `` We're waiting for a SWAT team from <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> and developing a plan to handle this guy,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> warrant from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> accused Savory of robbery and kidnapping in a September gun-store robbery in which five other people have been arrested. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said he had no other details on the robbery. He also has been investigated in connection with manufacturing and sale of illegal weapons and explosivies, and `` he is well known to authorities at the -LRB- <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -RRB- state and federal level,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> `` may be a citizen of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but we have very little on his background,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> apparently stopped the two suspects about 7:30 p.m. Saturday, but `` we do n't know the circumstances of why he stopped that car,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. There were at least 17 bullet holes in the windshield of <PERSON> Varner </PERSON>'s car, Sheriff <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. He was hit three times.

<HEAD>Official Papers Show Information Withheld On Nuclear Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The private papers of former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> show his government kept secret the details of a 1957 accident at an atomic power plant that contaminated milk at about 800 farms, according to a published report. The release Sunday of <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s papers marked the first time full details have been revealed about the spring 1957 accident at the <LOCATION> Windscale </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Cumbria </LOCATION>, northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The papers were cited in a report by The Observer, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper. The papers show that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> kept the information secret because he feared shaking public confidence in the industry and jeopardizing collaboration with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Observer cited the documents as saying the accident contaminated milk with high levels of strontium 90, a deadly isotope found in radioactive fallout. The newspaper said the milk was sold to the public without any warning. In a secret memo to <LOCATION> Macmillan </LOCATION> on Sept. 12, 1957, Agriculture Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> estimated `` 800 or more farms may be affected'' by an escape of strontium 90 and that `` the readings on some of these farms have been many times higher than the national average,'' the Observer said. It said <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> also wrote that no action was being taken `` to prevent milk being consumed or produced on farms in the area.'' The paper quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunstan </PERSON>, a former director of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, as saying full details of the amount of radioactivity released in the accident were not disclosed to the board until 1986. The release of the information came in connection with an inquiry into increased childhood leukemia near the plant, now known as <ORGANIZATION> Sellafield </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper did not report the cause of the accident and made no mention of any deaths attributed to it. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s documents were made public by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> under rules permitting publication of selected confidential papers after 30 years. Government papers made public a year ago said <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> also suppressed a report on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst ever nuclear accident at <LOCATION> Windscale </LOCATION> on Oct. 10, 1957. The report said the accident was caused by a fire. Sales of milk from an area measuring more than 200 square miles around the plant were banned after a release of radioactivity. The accident caused no immediate deaths. The problem-plagued plant on the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> is one of the West's oldest commercial atomic power stations and largest nuclear reprocessing plants It reprocesses used nuclear fuels from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other countries to extract uranium and plutonium for making nuclear bombs.

 An exhibition of modern art from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guggenheim </LOCATION> collections drew 121,000 visitors during its display at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s National Gallery, officials said. On Sunday, the last day of the exhibit, it took visitors 1 -LCB- hours to make it through the line to the second floor of <LOCATION> Sternberk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, where 50 paintings by 33 artists have hung since early November. The Guggenheim exhibit brought to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> expressionist, cubist, futurist, constructivist and surrealist masterpieces. It was preceded last summer by a Czech National Gallery exhibit of 60 canvases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art. On display in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> were paintings by artists such as <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubuffet </PERSON>. The two shows were based on a 1986 cultural agreement and a 10-year friendship between <LOCATION> Guggenheim </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotalik </PERSON>, the director of the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> gallery. `` It's a sign of improving relations. It could not have happened five years ago,'' said <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>, adding he saw the exhibit `` not merely as an art show but as a very significant cultural event.'' `` It's the first time ever that a full survey of 20th century paintings ... has been presented in any of the socialist countries,'' he said in an interview. He noted, however, that the show focused on the period 1900-45, and that a second exhibit would be needed to show contemporary art. This thought was echoed also in some of the entries in the visitors' book and complaints that the works on show were already well-known from literature. Most, however, were grateful. `` Thank you, we ourselves are not likely to get to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' wrote one visitor. Another said, `` thanks, but wish there had been more.'' There were so many visitors, up to 4,200 a day, that after a few days the gallery announced it was extending viewing time until 8 p.m. two days a week. `` Artwork necessarily creates an atmosphere of international understanding,'' wrote the trade union daily newspaper Prace. `` Art can speak with the same urgency to people throughout the world.'' The women's weekly <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON> said, `` We can only wish that the useful international cooperation continues. After all, it brings enrichment for both countries _ for us, especially, an expansion of knowledge of the various trends of contemporary 20th century art.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> appears bent on a political solution in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and has urged its Vietnamese allies to withdraw their occupation forces, Western and Soviet diplomats say. The Kremlin denies pressuring <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to pull out, but Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> has called a partial withdrawal in 1988 an `` avenue toward a speedy solution'' that could improve Soviet relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A summit of the two largest communist powers is expected this year, and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> might head the agenda. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded its Southeast Asian neighbor in December 1978, ousted the bloody <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime and installed another government. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said of the Chinese-Soviet dispute over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>: `` I think they've both decided to put this one behind them, to sweep this one under the rug.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> backs <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and its client regime in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> arms <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and other rebel groups fighting that government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s apparent retrenchment after a decade fits its current policy of shedding or reducing costly foreign involvements. It also does not appear to relish being <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s major donor of foreign aid. `` This kind of monopoly we certainly do not like,'' said a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. He said his country was especially unhappy about having to provide all <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s oil, on credit. Most Western analysts believe the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to retain its influence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> but at a level that would not antagonize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or the non-communist nations of the region, with which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seeks better economic and political relations. Although the Soviet investment in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is substantial, it does not approach the amount the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has committed to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> or to neighboring <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has not carried out pledges of reconstruction made 10 years ago. Official Cambodian media said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> extended aid worth $ 133 million in 1979-80 to help overcome famine and devastation caused by nearly four years of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> governemtn. Aid levels are believed to have been substantially lower since, but no reliable estimates are available. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> estimates the Soviets pour the equivalent of more than $ 3 billion a year into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Several hundred Soviet advisers are stationed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, involved in projects ranging from a ground satellite station to a veterinary medicine center. Soviet pilots fly planes of the Cambodian airline and engineers sent by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> are renovating the electric power supply system. By 1990, more than 3,500 scholarships are expected to have been provided for Cambodians studying in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Most of the bill for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s army and the Vietnamese occupation force also goes to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Western analysts say that is an important reason the Soviets want to get the Vietnamese out and reach a political solution with rebel groups. Little Soviet blood has been shed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has not installed a naval base at the <LOCATION> Kompong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Som </LOCATION> port, as some observers expected. It also has not built the roads, communications and other facilities needed in a country plagued for nearly 20 years by war, <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule, invasion and insurgency. According to Soviet diplomats, their government wants to cut unnecessary items from the current aid program. They scoff at some suggestions from their aid bureaucracy, like establishing a circus or getting involved in tourism. One diplomat, noting deficiencies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s own development of tourism, said the Cambodians `` saw the light'' and decided to invite <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> businessmen to restore a first-class hotel in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>.

 Two separate bus accidents killed 41 people, official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news reports said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 31 people were killed when a bus carrying a bride and her relatives collided with a freight train Sunday in northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> province on the Bingbei Railway Line.

In another accident, a bus carrying 46 passengers plunged into an icy river Saturday, killing 10 people and injuring 32 others, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said `` hundreds of local people, policemen and doctors'' jumped into the river to help save the passengers. Passers-by smashed the bus windows with axes and bamboo poles in the rescue effort, the newspaper said. Four were still missing, it said. The crash occurred outside of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> when the bus left the road and plunged over a 24-foot-high bridge into a river. The bus landed upside down and was submerged, the report said.

 An 88-year-old man who had been feuding with the other residents of his small, cramped retirement home was accused today of killing two of them and injuring four others while they slept, authorities said. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who walks with the aid of a cane, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and was being held without bond in the <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Police Chief <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' clothes and cane were bloodstained when he was picked up Sunday evening while strolling through this city about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, police said. He was taken into custody about 12 hours after the victims' bodies were found. The injuries could have been caused by the cane but that had n't been confirmed, he said. The bodies of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickbarge </PERSON>, 90, and <PERSON> Myrtle </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 73, were discovered Sunday morning by two nurses at the Reflections I retirement home, one of whom had slept only a few feet away from where the attack occurred, police said. The victims apparently were asleep at the time of the attack, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The police chief said there was bitterness between <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and other residents `` that had been building for some time and came to a head.'' While he did n't know the cause of the bitterness, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said cramped quarters in the home, where <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> lived with two other men in a 9-foot-by-10-foot room, may have contributed. <PERSON> Nickbarge </PERSON> was found in his bedroom, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was found in the living room. The two, last seen around midnight Saturday, had been beaten about the head, neck and shoulders, police said. `` Some furniture had been overturned, and there was broken glass on the floor,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuner </PERSON>. Four other people were injured, two seriously. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tear </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 89, was listed in critical but stable condition today with a fractured skull, cuts and bruises at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Tear is the father-in-law of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tear </PERSON>, who owns Reflections I and a similar home nearby. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 67, was in guarded condition at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with two broken arms, cuts on her face and head, and bruises. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, 71, and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 85, were both listed in fair condition with facial cuts at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION> about 10 miles south of here. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> also suffered a broken collarbone. Nine people lived in the home. All six victims had been sleeping in rooms near the front of the house, said <PERSON> Neuner </PERSON>. `` Some residents in the rear of the house said they heard strange noises in the night,'' <PERSON> Neuner </PERSON> said, but no one rose to investigate. The home's three other residents were transferred Sunday to Reflections II nearby. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a retired fruit picker, checked into the home after his house burned down in November, police said. Neighbors said he often collected and sold junk.

<HEAD>Armenian Paper Prints Alleged Threat; Activists Calls It a Fake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Armenian newspaper has printed an alleged threat by Armenian militants to wage terrorist attacks with U.S.-made Stinger missiles if their leaders are not freed from jail. The activists called it a fake. The purported letter, published by <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper, demands the immediate release of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group that has led an 11-month campaign for the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. If the committee's leaders are not freed, the unsigned document says, `` we will have recourse to mass terror. ... In our arsenals, we have ` Stingers,' provided by our friends.'' A facsimile copy of the purported document was published in <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>'s Dec. 28 editions, which reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over the weekend. <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> said the letter was received by law-enforcement officials, and labeled `` to be transmitted to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' It made no additional reference to the Stingers. Many of the U.S.-manufactured ground-to-air missiles have been shipped by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to Afghan insurgents fighting their country's pro-Moscow government <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, an Armenian activist, said the letter printed by <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> was a `` total fabrication from beginning to end,'' and another attempt by officials to discredit the <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> committee militants. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, an Armenian-Russian activist who was released last week after 30 days in jail in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, for filming soldiers who are enforcing a curfew, said the grammatical construction of the letter was too complicated for most Armenians. The letter was written in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, which Armenians learn in school in addition to their own language and alphabet. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> also distributed a copy of an interview with <PERSON> Ashot </PERSON> <PERSON> Manucharyan </PERSON>, a member of the Armenian Supreme Soviet legislature who <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said is a fugitive because of his nationalist activities. <PERSON> Manucharyan </PERSON> was quoted as saying he was told about such threatening letters by the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police five months ago, when no members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were under detention. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said the appearance of the article may herald a further crackdown by Soviet authorities on the committee, seven of whose members are now in jail and the other four reportedly in hiding to avoid arrest. `` Now that so many members of the committee have been arrested, there is no one to answer these ridiculous charges,'' <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. `` The press is now closed to anyone from the committee.'' Soviet authorities jailed committee leaders after the Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Authorities have accused committee members of sabotaging the earthquake relief effort and whipping up ethnic tensions by continuing to seek <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a demand the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has refused

 A man serving a 25-year to life sentence for the 1978 slaying of a restaurateur who took his cover-girl lover away from him has been granted permission to seek a new trial. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, who says he's being treated for bone cancer in <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> state prison, was granted permission to file new motions on Feb. 1 by Appellate Division Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The ruling was made Dec. 8, the newspaper said. Three previous appeals of <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s conviction of murdering <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON> have been denied. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, 58, one of the nation's most successful thoroughbred horse trainers in the 1960s and 1970s, maintains that <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON> was a narcotics dealer slain in a drug dispute. `` I'm innocent, plain and simple,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> told Newsday from <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION>. The government, with model <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> a major witness in an 11-week trial in 1980, said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> shot and stabbed <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON> to death because Miss <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> left him after four years and moved into an apartment across the hall with <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fahringer </ORGANIZATION>, said a new trial will be sought on grounds that the prosecution hid statements by a witness who said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was not one of the three men she saw at the site where <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>'s body was dumped. Miss <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, 33, now an actress with a 3-year-old daughter, told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> she still believed <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> guilty and would `` be shocked if it turned out differently.''

<HEAD>Pilots Test New Soviet Passenger Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pilots on Monday made their first test of a new Soviet airliner, the Tupolev 204, that designers say is more roomy and efficient than current <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jets, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The 214-seat airliner is to go into service at the end of 1990 and be one of <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>'s principal medium-range carrier in the 1990s, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The evening TV news program `` Vremya'' showed a yellow twin-engine jet on a tarmac in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> preparing for its 32-minute flight. News reports did not say if any problems were found in the flight. The Tu-204 `` belongs to a new generation of airliners, economical, equipped with most up-to-date electronic systems and instruments of Soviet make, and very comfortable for passengers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Chief engineer of the new plane, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanovsky </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> it will have wider corridors and more leg room than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s notoriously cramped airliners The plane will be built in modules, so first-class and business-class sections also can be built in, he said. Some <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> planes that fly international routes have business-class sections, but there is no such differentiation on domestic flights. It will be much more energy efficient than the Tupolev 154, currently the most efficient Soviet passenger jet, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said test pilots and engineers will test up to 3,000 components of the plane in the next 12 to 18 months, and that it probably will be displayed at international air shows before it goes into general service. The Tu-204 is likely to replace the Tu-154 on some routes. It has been carrying passengers on regular routes since 1972.

<HEAD>President Rejects Clemency For Convicted Gandhi Assassin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> on Monday rejected an appeal for clemency for one of the two Sikhs condemned to death for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, defense lawyers said. Lawyers for <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said they would file another round of appeals Tuesday to halt their executions. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Jethmalani </PERSON>, the defense attorney for <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, said the earliest his client could be hanged was at dawn Wednesday, but said he would launch appeals in the trial court, appellate court and <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. Under Indian law, a man condemned to be executed has to be hanged within seven days of the issue of the death warrants but not before 24 hours from the time it is issued. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohapatra </PERSON>, superintendent of the maximum-security Tihar jail, where the convicted men are lodged, said Monday he had received the `` black warrants'' for the executions, but refused to say when they would take place. <PERSON> Rupinder </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodhi </PERSON>, defense attorney for <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> sent a letter Monday to <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Rajinder </PERSON>, informing him of the decision to turn down the plea for mercy. It was the second time he has turned down a mercy petition by <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 54. `` After carefully considering the petition ... the president of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has declined to grant pardon or any other relief ... and has rejected the petition,'' the letter said. It gave no reason for the rejection, which vacated the stays of execution for <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The two men are not related. All male Sikhs take the name of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion in the Punjabi language, by doctrine of their faith. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has not filed a mercy petition with the president, but under Indian law his death sentence was automatically delayed when <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> asked for clemency. <PERSON> Sodhi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> would not ask the president for clemency. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot in the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residence on Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One of them, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later. The other, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was arrested, tried and sentenced to the gallows. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an uncle of <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to death. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination was in apparent revenge for an army raid she had ordered four months earlier on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, to clear the complex of Sikh militants entrenched inside. On Oct. 30, <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> filed his first mercy petition. It was dismissed by the president Nov. 24 and the two men were ordered to hang on Dec. 2. But <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s lawyers challenged the president's decision in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, arguing <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> had powers to review the case. The court granted a stay 15 hours before the two were to be hanged. On Dec. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered the president to reconsider the appeal. A trial court convicted them in 1986 and sentenced them to death. The convictions and death sentences were upheld by an appeals court later that year and by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last August. Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, claim they are discriminated by the Hindus, the country's religious majority accounting for over 80 percent of the population. Militant Sikhs are fighting a 6-year-old guerrilla war for a separate nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Over 2,400 deaths last year were blamed on the militants.

 She was one of 12 teen-agers left with severe burns after the church bus crash that killed 27 people last year, but <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> is learning to adjust. Friends, counselors and even strangers are helping. `` One day this kid looked at me and said, ` What happened to your hands and face?' and my friends ran up to him and said, ` If you do n't like what you see, do n't look,''' <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, principal at J.T. <ORGANIZATION> Alton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said survivors of the May 14 crash deserve the credit for a smooth transition in returning to school. `` These kids are fantastically courageous,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` It's been an inspiration for me. <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> must wear skin-tight pressure garments that doctors say will help prevent her burns from leaving hideous scars. She thinks the flesh-colored suit that covers her from her head to her knees is ugly. `` If the doctor told me I did n't have to wear it anymore, I'd throw a party,'' she said Still, the 14-year-old does n't let the chin strap prevent her from endless phone conversations with friends or the pressure gloves from wearing several rings over them. Life goes on for <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> and the 39 others who nearly burned to death inside the church bus after it was hit head-on by a pickup truck driver. Police say <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s truck crashed into the bus from the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Radcliff while he was driving the wrong way on Interstate 71. The bus, returning to <PERSON> Radcliff </PERSON> after the church group spent the day at an amusement park north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, burst into flames. The 67 people aboard survived the impact, but three adults and 24 children died as they tried to escape the burning bus. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder and other charges, including drunken driving. He was released from jail on $ 540,000 bond Oct. 10. Aside from periodic absences for surgery, the student survivors are all back in school. Doctors and therapists monitor their healing to see what they can do to limit disfigurement for the seven who had skin grafts. The <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school system has worked to smooth the way for the students by inviting a burn specialist to lead a seminar for school staff in August. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rengers </PERSON>, a nurse at <LOCATION> Kosair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, gave a similar presentation to students at <ORGANIZATION> Alton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in September She said many teen-agerss associate burn patients with <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, the disfigured character in the `` Nightmare on Elm Street'' horror movies. `` I have to tell them, ` Burn patients are not monsters. They're the same people; they just look different.''' But she said it's natural for patients to worry about their looks. `` Physical appearance is a big part of our culture. It's even more important for teens.'' The battle now, therapists say, is to get the patients to wear the pressure garments. <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> said her friends yell at her when she tries to take them off. But other students have resisted the treatment because the garments are noticeable and often uncomfortable. <PERSON> Dotty </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> said her daughter, <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>, a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, has come home in tears on several occasions after people commented about her appearance or voice, which is deeper because her vocal chords burned, grew together and had to be surgically separated. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> also has second - and third-degree burns on her arm and shoulders Said <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>: `` The memory will always be there. And then you look down and see the scar to remind you.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has heard nothing from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, on help in tracking down those responsible for last month's bombing of a Pan American jetliner over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` We've not heard from him,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters upon landing here after spending the New Year's weekend in Palms Springs. `` If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure he'll tell us.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> had said on Sunday that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has `` a wealth of information'' that could help in the investigation of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 that killed 270 people. Without the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s help, Sessions said on two television interview shows, the govenment expects a lengthy manhunt but is optimistic that those responsible will be found eventually. `` We're set up for the long haul,'' he said. `` We have a pattern and reputation for being able to solve'' such crimes. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief said he would welcome any help <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> might provide. He said contacts between the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> presumably could be set up by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials recently opened talks on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> disavowed terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist Sessions said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` has a great deal of information, a wealth of information he can give us.'' Last week the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Seyasseh </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the organization was considering a request by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> help in tracking down those responsible for the bombing. While welcoming <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s help in identifying possible suspects in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash, Sessions said he opposes any attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader to retaliate by killing any suspects. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has blamed terrorists for bringing down the jetliner, condemning it as an `` inhuman criminal action.'' Asked about reports that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is consider organizing an assassination team to retailiate against those who planted the bomb, Sessions said, `` We believe in the system of justice. We hope those people are handled in the courts.'' Sessions said he has no evidence as yet to confirm the bombing was the work of terrorists rather than a non-political criminal act aimed at an individual on board the jet. He also said that 62 bodies from the crash have been identified through fingerprinting. Meawhile, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION>, also appeared on `` Meet the Press,'' and defended the policy of not publicizing threats to airliners. `` These threats are transmitted on a routine basis,'' he said. But <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> conceded that it was mistake for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to warn overseas embassy personnel about the threat to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jets while not alerting the public. `` Personally, I do n't think it was managed well,'' he said. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said an alert has been issued to the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport and others in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> area to be on the lookout for false passports. `` There has been movement of some known terrorists who have in their possession false passports,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> will negotiate with <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies to seek improved airline security. `` This is a threat against civil aviation. It's not just isolated to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> carriers,'' he said. On CBS' `` Face the Nation,'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should keep open the possibility of military retaliation against any nation linked to terrorist attacks `` The military option always has to be there,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` But we do n't want to indiscriminately bomb areas.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> distanced herself from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talk of punishing whoever planted the bomb. `` I do n't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever valid,'' she said. `` The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought to justice,'' she said in a British television interview.

 A woman celebrating her birthday with her husband broke into hysteria after returning home to find that a fire had destroyed their wooden house, killing 10 people, including their four children.

Mrs. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> was kept overnight for observation at <ORGANIZATION> Itasca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> early today in the north-central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, 20 miles northeast of this town of 400 residents. She was expected to be released today, hospital officials said. The fire spread so quickly it was unlikely anyone woke up before being overcome by smoke, said <PERSON> Renn </PERSON>. It was sparked by a wood-burning stove or an oil space heater, <PERSON> Renn </PERSON> said. He originally said the house was not equipped with smoke detectors, which were not required by law. But later, after a relative said there were indeed three smoke detectors in the house, <PERSON> Renn </PERSON> said, `` We may have to retract that.'' The fire was discovered by passing motorists, who stopped at the house of Melody Berczyk across the road from the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> home. `` It was one big ball of flame right then,'' said <PERSON> Berczyk </PERSON>, who called the fire department. A crisis intervention team was asked to come to the elementary school Tuesday to help the children deal with the deaths of their classmates. `` Hopefully, we'll just all pull together,'' said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Doro </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Watsons </ORGANIZATION> had left the children with her sister and brother-in-law, who were visiting from <LOCATION> Bemidji </LOCATION>, to celebrate Mrs. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s 32nd birthday on New Year's Eve. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>, a stepsister of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> children loved the outdoors. `` They had pet rabbits and geese and ducks,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> liked drawing and painting a lot, especially unicorns and horses. She just won $ 75 in a contest at school, which was a really big thing to her,'' <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Watsons </ORGANIZATION>, who are unemployed, `` were a poor family as far as material things go, but they were a very close family,'' said Pound. She said a fund has been set up for the victims' families at the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Remer </PERSON>. `` In a small town, everyone is family,'' she said. `` This is by far the most devastating thing that has ever happened to this town. `` Everybody will pull together and help in any way you can. Even though it's not going to bring the kids back, the families will know that everyone in this town is hurt by what happened and is behind them. This has touched everybody,'' Pound said. In other fires, <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> police said two adults and two children were killed in a trailer fire Sunday. Seven people died in fires in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> during all of 1988, authorities said. Four members of a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> family died and three others were injured in a New Year's Day fire blamed on smoldering smoking materials in their cinder-block house, fire officials said. Killed were a woman, 26, her 18-month-old son, her sister, 11, and the sisters' 65-year-old great-uncle. Two of the injured were in in critical condition, authorities said. Two boys, ages 4 months and 2 years, were killed and a 5-year-old boy was critically injured in a fire at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> public housing project this morning, authorities said. The cause was under investigation. A father and son died in a house fire Sunday in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The father carried his wife through their burning home to safety before re-entering the house, where he died in an unsuccessful effort to save his 20-year-old son, authorities said. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, New Year's Day fires killed one person in a <LOCATION> Waukesha </LOCATION> hotel room and one in a <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> residence. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, a couple was found dead in a bedroom closet following an early Sunday fire that destroyed their home in <LOCATION> Willsboro </LOCATION> along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION>; and a 7-year-old girl died and her 3-year-old brother was critically injured Sunday evening when a fire engulfed their two-story home in <LOCATION> Ogdensburg </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a mother and her infant daughter were killed in a house with a defective smoke detector on New Year's Eve, officials said. An 11-year-old boy was arrested and charged with murder in an apartment fire that killed a 53-year-old man in the southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Biddeford </LOCATION> on Saturday night, officials said. In <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, a house fire early Saturday killed a firefighter and a woman and left her husband in serious condition, authorities said.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Searchers on Monday recovered part of the tail section of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, and civic officials said they would meet to discuss plans for rebuilding parts of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> destroyed by the crash. Police Superintendent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said part of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's tail section was found near <LOCATION> Lengholm </LOCATION>, about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, along with `` sizable pieces'' of nearby wreckage that has not been identified `` The area is very rough terrain and there has been no confirmation yet from the accident investigators about what parts of the aircraft are there -LRB- other than the tail part -RRB-,'' he said. Only 20 percent of the jumbo jet had been recovered from the crash site, although other parts of the plane have been seen, he said. All 259 passengers and crew members on the New York-bound jet died in the Dec. 21 crash. Authorities have recovered three bodies of 11 townspeople presumed killed on the ground. Ten houses were destroyed by falling wreckage, replaced by a crater 100 feet long and 30 feet deep. Another 30 homes were badly damaged. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> regional council, said council officials would meet with residents to discuss rebuilding plans. Thirteen bodies were identified Monday, including that of passenger <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s husband, Capt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> pilot, accused local police over the weekend of being `` paralyzed by inexperience and incompetence'' and of delaying the return of victims' bodies to their relatives. Chief Constable <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> police force said he sympathized with bereaved relatives, but added everything was being done to positively identify the victims. He said 81 of the 242 recovered bodies have been released. No bodies were recovered Monday. `` Every effort continues to be made to identify and release victims' bodies to their families,'' he said. `` The trauma and grief experienced by relatives continues to be uppermost in our minds.'' In a related development, passengers on Scandinavian Airlines System faced delays Monday as the airline issued a worldwide security alert after receiving a bombing threat, officials said. The warning was received early Sunday from <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> police through <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>. A security alert was transmitted to about 90 international airports used by <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> aircraft, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> radio reported that an unknown caller telephoned police headquarters in the Hungarian capital, warning that an <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> airliner would be blown up. The report did not elaborate. Security at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport also was tightened. A police spokesman said security had been increased around <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and several Arab airline terminals and baggage check-in counters. The Flight 103 investigation is focused on the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> crash site, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The flight originated as a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and, following a stop in <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the jumbo jet. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, a prosecutor's spokesman said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet had been carrying four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military mail sacks and a bank document pouch that were not checked by <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport security officials. The Munich-based weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Bunte </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified security expert as saying the bomb could have been smuggled in with the mail. Spokesman <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harth </PERSON> at the federal prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the post bags and bank pouch were not checked by airport security `` because they had been continuously under the control of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said Sunday he welcomed any information <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> could provide in identifying suspects. The Sunday Express, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> daily, reported without attribution that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had vowed to dispatch an assassination squad to hunt down and kill the bomber. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` has a great deal of information, a wealth of information he can give us,'' Sessions said in an interview. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> distanced herself Sunday from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vows to punish the culprits. `` I do n't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever valid,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said on the `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> on Sunday'' program. `` The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought to justice.''

<HEAD>Revamped Christian Science Monitor To Make Debut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A revamped Christian Science Monitor makes its debut Tuesday, with color photography, fewer pages and less advertising all aimed at streamlining the newspaper <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> founded 80 years ago. The changes prompted an exodus in November of top management at the church-run daily newspaper, including the departure of Pulitzer Prize-winning editor <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>. But company executives said Monday that five years of research showed the newspaper's readers, faced with other demands on their time, wanted more concise articles and `` greater selectivity'' of coverage. `` In short, they continue to look to the Monitor for the context and perspective of events, and want a serious paper that can be read thoroughly in about 30 minutes,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a statement. The society publishes the Monitor. The newspaper, published Monday through Friday with a circulation of about 170,000, is still a tabloid. But it will now be 20 pages, smaller by about eight pages in its new format which limits national advertising to two pages and eliminates local and classified ads. In addition, the staff of 160 people are among the 800 members of the publishing society and broadcasting operation due for cutbacks of 20 percent to 25 percent, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldheim </PERSON>, spokesman for publishing society. Supporting the newspaper reportedly has cost the church $ 20 million a year. Mrs. <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, who became the first woman editor of the Monitor in 1983, resigned along with her managing editor and assistant managing editor in November. She said she left rather than see the newspaper reduced in size, while also losing independence under a restructured management that concentrated more on the church's broadcasting arm.

<HEAD>Small Chippewa Band Considers Settlement on Food-Gathering Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLE LAKE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s smallest <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> band have recommended that tribal members approve the state's proposed $ 10 million settlement to limit the band's hunting and fishing treaty rights The Chippewa's exercise of treaty rights has been a source of controversy and protest by sportsfishermen and other outdoorsmen who argue it is unfair for Indians to use methods or seasons prohibited others and that the exercise of the court-upheld food-gathering rights may harm or deplete natural resources. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, an attorney representing the <LOCATION> Sokaogon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> unanimously adopted the final draft of an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and recommended it for approval by the community. A meeting is scheduled Tuesday night to introduce the settlement, and a Jan. 14 referendum has been set, said council member <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackley </PERSON>. If the agreement is ratified, it must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and signed by Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> by Feb. 15, <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> said. He said the agreement calls for payments of $ 1 million each year for 10 years and that 75 percent of the money is to go toward economic development and the rest is to pay for health and social programs. The Sokaogon band would have to give up some rights, including spearfishing outside of that for ceremonial purposes. The band would be limited to 100 fish speared per year, he said. The band also would forfeit its right to harvest timber on public land except for firewood, he said. The agreement could be extended for an additional 15 years at the option of both parties. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicks </PERSON>, who drafted the agreement, refused to say over the weekend whether offers similar to that prepared for the Sokaogon band have been drawn up for five other <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> bands in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. State and tribal lawyers have negotiated for months in an attempt to reach an agreement over the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>'s off-reservation claims to natural resources guaranteed by 19th-century federal treaties. The tribe's insistence on using spears to catch game fish, a technique ordinarily forbidden by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, has been a volatile subject between tribal traditionalists and treaty critics. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he could not comment whether similar deals were under consideration by other bands. The Sokaogon is believed to be the smallest <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> band in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with about 1,300 members at <LOCATION> Mole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>President Takes Office, Calls For an End to Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANDY, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was sworn in as president Monday in a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> ceremony at the Temple of the Tooth, and he again appealed for an end to the ethnic violence that has devastated the tropical island. `` Further delay in finding a solution will enable certain elements to destroy many more innocent lives. This destruction must end because democracy can not tolerate it,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said in his inaugural address. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, 64, took the oaths of office and secrecy before Chief Justice <PERSON> Parinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranaginshe </PERSON> during a two-hour ceremony in this picturesque hill town, 85 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital. Heavily armed soldiers surrounded the sacred Temple of the Tooth, where more than 500,000 people gathered to watch the ceremony. Police sharpshooters were perched on surrounding roofs, and troop on the ground checked all those entering the city. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> won a six-year term by defeating two opponents in the Dec. 19 presidential election. He polled 50.4 percent of the vote, although only 55 percent of the 9.3 million eligible voters cast ballots. He succeeds his mentor, <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewaredene </PERSON>, as president after serving as his prime minister for 11 years. The president wields supreme power in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> assumes the task of ruling a nation reeling from five years of strife between the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> and the Hindu Tamils. Nearly 10,000 people have died since 1983 when Tamil militants began fighting for independence from the majority Sinhalese. The fighting also has left the national economy in shambles, ruining the island's crucial tourism industry and reducing agricultural production. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> also faces an uneasy relationship with regional superpower <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which sent an estimated 47,000 peacekeeping troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> 18 months ago to disarm the rebels and enforce a cease-fire. The insurgency has yet to be quelled, however, and <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said he wants the unpopular Indian soldiers to leave. On Sunday, the Indian government announced it would start withdrawing its troops this week at <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s request. Between 2,000 and 3,000 soldiers are expected to leave within days. The remaining troops will be gradually pulled out, the government said, but gave no timetable. Speaking from the octagonal central courtyard of the ancient <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> shrine, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> in his inaugural speech vowed he would not allow `` a single inch'' of Sri Lankan soil to be occupied by any foreign country again. `` Let us settle our problems by ourselves through negotiations and mutual respect. We should not create situations that provoke or invite foreign intervention,'' he said. Unlike most of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ruling elite, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was born in the slums of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. During his campaign, he frequently said he was the only candidate who could champion the poor in this country where the per capital annual income of $ 360. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1956 and entered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> four years later. When the party returned to power in 1977, he became <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s prime minister. He remained at that post throughout <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s term, although the two men had some policy differences, most prominently over the Indian-sponsored accord aimed at ending the Tamil rebellion. The pact, signed on July 29, 1987, offered limited autonomy to Tamil community in the north and east provinces and invited <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to send peacekeeping soldiers to combat the rebels who still demand independence. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed the accord. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> opposes it. Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. They claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government. The biggest and most militant Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the accord, saying it did not meet enought of their demands for self-rule. A radical Sinhalese group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, also denounced the pact, claiming it granted too many concessions to the Tamil community. The Front has been blamed for more than 900 murders since the accord was signed. Most victims have been government supporters. During the campaign, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> took pains not to blame Sinhalese extremists for escalating violence. He has yet to say how he will deal with the radicals, but pledged to provide security to any member of extremists groups. `` I call upon those who have not joined the democratic process to do so,'' he said. `` I am available at any time, anywhere to discuss any problem.''

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reported scores of people killed and dozens wounded Monday, the second day of a New Year's cease-fire proclaimed by the Soviet-backed regime but rejected by the Moslem guerrillas Two insurgent leaders criticized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for considering a role in a future Afghan government for former King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who was overthrown in 1973 and lives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for talks with Afghan insurgent leaders based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He met in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> last month with <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, leader of a seven-faction alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. At least 5.5 million Afghans have fled their country during a decade of civil war, nearly all of them to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Moslem nations that are <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbors on the east and west. Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. An estimated 115,000 were there when a U.N.-mediated withdrawal agreement was signed April 14, 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers started leaving May 15 and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said half were gone by Aug. 15. All are to be out by Feb. 15. The insurgents, supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have demanded an Islamic government after the Soviets leave and are trying to overthrow the regime of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> announced the cease-fire Friday, effective New Year's Day, and said government forces would not fire unless fired upon. Insurgent leaders believe <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government will fall when the Soviets are gone and rejected the truce because, they said, it would be a disadvantage to them at this stage. State radio in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said Monday that insurgents attacked <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in the southeast, killing three civilians and wounding six. It said 31 guerrillas were killed and 27 wounded in an ensuing battle with security forces. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said the guerrillas fired on residential areas of <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>, near the Pakistani border, and security forces returned the fire, killing 17 insurgents. Two more battles, in which 23 guerrillas were slain, occurred at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gushta </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nangarahar </LOCATION> province, the radio claimed. It did not mention government casualties and there was no independent confirmation of its reports. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, insurgent leaders <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gulbadin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> criticized the Soviets for overtures to the former king. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, who also is <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Dec. 24. `` <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> will certainly not feel safe in the revolutionary <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said at a news conference, and <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> declared the king `` has no place in today's <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' `` The Afghan people will strongly resist any move against formation of an Islamic government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said.

 Students chanted pro-democracy slogans Monday as they marched in a funeral cortege with 100,000 other mourners to bury the widow of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>. The students defied a ban on public gatherings to accompany the body of Daw <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> along the five-mile route from her home to the burial site on the southern end of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s Shwedagon Pagoda. It was the first student march since a military crackdown in September. No soldiers were seen near the crowds, although some armed personnel stood a distance away. A few police officers kept order. <PERSON> Daw </PERSON> <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, 77, died Dec. 27 after a long illness. She was the widow of Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, who was assassinated in 1947.

The student-led demonstrations ended when soldiers killed hundreds of protesters and military commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup Sept. 18, and authorities banned politically motivated public gatherings. The students defied the ban during the 2 -LCB- - hour funeral procession `` We wo n't forget our colleagues who have fallen in the fight for democracy!'' they sang. `` We will continue our struggle!'' Students carried placards with other anti-government slogans. Marchers also carried banners and flags of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founders <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> returned to the television pulpit Monday for the first time in two years with an appeal for `` hurting people'' to keep the faith, but no direct pleas for donations. `` If <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> can survive their holocaust of the last two years, then you can make it,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal. `` The <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Show'' originated in the living room of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' borrowed home in this <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> suburb. They said it was sent by satellite to a half-dozen stations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, with the couple's new ministry paying for air time. The hourlong telecast is scheduled Mondays through Fridays. `` We bought time,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` We had a certain amount of money and that's all the time we could buy, and it's not a lot of money, but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful.'' In their prime at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and their `` PTL Club'' could be seen on about 180 television stations. As in their old show, the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> sat on a couch. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> wore her trademark heavy eye makeup and broke into tears several times, the first just two minutes into their show. The couple made no direct appeal for funds, but gave an address and telephone number so viewers could request prayers. And the show's guest, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> songwriter <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, gave Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a card which he said he had been asked to deliver by a supporter. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the card contained a $ 1,000 check. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bland </PERSON>, a volunteer at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ministries </PERSON>, said Monday's show drew `` a beautiful response.'' `` A lot of people called in who said they were partners -LRB- supporters who gave $ 1,000 or more to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and glad to see that they were back on TV,'' <PERSON> Bland </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' last appearance as television evangelists was in January 1987, two months before the scandal that drove them from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. They had left the air because Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was receiving treatment for dependency on prescription drugs and for pneumonia, the couple said at the time. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, I think this is probably the happiest day of my life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said as the show began. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers that his last television appearance was to break ground for the <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the home of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe that was the last straw for Satan,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` I think the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built. ... I believe the devil said, ` I have to smash <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> following disclosure of his 1980 sexual encounter with a church secretary, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, and that she had been paid for her silence. In June 1987, the ministry sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court, and last month a judge approved the sale of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief asset, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Also last month, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and a top aide were indicted on charges they used <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds for private gain But the only mention of his legal troubles during the show came when <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> noted a song he said he wrote in a lawyer's office. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` did n't know anything about lawyers.'' `` Oh no-o-o-o,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said with a pained chuckle. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuenschel </PERSON>, general manager <ORGANIZATION> WOCD </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of the stations broadcasting the program, said he would show it `` as long as they keep paying.'' He said the station has a 30-day contract for the show, but declined to say how much the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> are paying except to say it was `` the usual rate per hour.''

<TEXT>
 For just $ 300, police have added 40 recruits to patrol the streets of this northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> city. They do n't make arrests, but they will drive people to jail _ for a fee. The recruits are the drivers of <ORGANIZATION> De-Luxe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yellow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who have enlisted in a 2-week-old program to give police more eyes and ears in the streets. `` This is an excellent opportunity for us to take advantage of the fact that cab drivers operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the same streets that we patrol,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, a police administrative supervisor. Under the new program, Taxis On Patrol, cab drivers report suspicious activity to dispatchers over two-way radios. The dispatchers then notify police. `` You name it and we see it,'' said cab driver <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>. `` We stop fights, rapes and all of those things.'' Still, authorities say they do n't want cab drivers to stop crimes, just to tell police about them. `` We're not asking them to do police work or to get involved,'' said city Commissioner <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Callery </PERSON>. `` They're strictly to call an event in and alert us to the situation.'' <PERSON> Callery </PERSON> proposed the taxi program after reading about similar efforts elsewhere. `` It'll never take the place of more policemen, but it will assist us,'' the commissioner said. The $ 300 start-up cost of the program covered a 2 -LCB- - hour training program for drivers and the printing of decals affixed to the taxis Authorities in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, tried a similar system in 1983, but gave up after cab drivers lost interest, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawhorn </PERSON>, an inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> Nashville-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxicab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> slowly may be winning converts to his policy of glasnost, or openness, but whether the word merits inclusion in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dictionary remains under debate. The honor likely to be accorded such all-American terms as `` televangelist'' and `` computer virus'' in upcoming Merriam-Webster dictionaries has so far been denied the word describing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms `` It is still most often found in either italics or quotes and to us that means it has not been completely Americanized,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, senior editor at Springfield-based G.C. <ORGANIZATION> Merriam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` When reporters and writers start using it without explaining what it means it will be ready for consideration for the dictionary.'' The term `` computer virus'' came into wide use too late for this year's book, but it is an almost sure bet for inclusion in the next addendum to the company's unabridged dictionary, <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said, thanks to a graduate student who this autumn unleashed a `` virus'' that clogged university and military computers and exposed the vulnerability of computer banks to infection. `` Televangelist,'' `` colorization,'' as used to describe the tinting of old black-and-white films, and `` zap,'' when used to describe what happens to a television commercial when a viewer switches to another channel by remote control, are also likely candidates for the unabridged dictionary, he said.

 Monday was a holiday within a holiday for many parents who had the day off but sent their children back to school.

<HEAD>Trade Unions Ready for More Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s prime minister told trade union leaders Monday the economy still needs price increases, but his listeners hinted that imposing them might lead to a recurrence of violent strikes. Steep price increases announced Dec. 26 led to demonstrations and a general strike. Four people died and scores were injured before union leaders called off the protests Saturday, two days after the government rescinded the price increases. On Monday, more than 500 leaders of trade and professional organizations met with Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to discuss the impact of the violence and the government's failure to endorse an initiative to end civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. In addition to the rollback on prices, the government gave in to a demand by the Sudanese Workers' <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> to make salary increases of up to 500 percent retroactive to July 1, instead of Dec. 1 as the government had ordered. While <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> conceded the price increases may have been too high _ as much as 600 percent for sugar _ he said prices on some items had to be raised. He promised to stay away from important foods, however, and said subsidies on sorghum, the Sudanese staple, and medicines would n't be touched. `` There are other possibilities and other more reasonable -LRB- price -RRB- increases that I do n't want to go into now,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. He said the price of sugar, extremely important in the Sudanese culture, must be increased to cover its production costs and to prevent smuggling into neighboring countries. `` Any steps must not affect the workers and struggling people and add to their burdens,'' said <PERSON> Abdel-Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinada </PERSON>, representative of the professional associations. `` We reject any increase in prices. We are ready for civil disobedience and general strikes.'' Professional groups carry considerable weight in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and played a decisive role in the 1985 military coup that ousted the authoritarian pro-Western president, <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. Tradesmen and students were the major forces behind last week's disturbances. Western observers fear the trade and professional unions might join forces with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, still angered over <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s handling of the peace agreement it reached a month and a half ago with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. During the strike, the Unionists resigned from the coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> headed by the <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in sympathy with the demonstrators and outrage over the prime minister's stand on the peace agreement. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> apparently refused to officially endorse the agreement because of a clause advocating suspension of the 1,400-year-old Islamic legal code, which was sure to anger the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ the third-largest <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> partner and <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s buffer against his traditional opponents, the Democratic Unionists. Publicly, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> says he objects to the pact's clauses eliminating defense treaties with other countries and ending emergency rule, which has been <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s overthrow in 1985. The unions have been demanding immediate implementation of the peace plan and a cease-fire in the 5 -LCB- - year-old civil war on ground it would save the country $ 275 million a year <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is $ 14 billion, and <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> owes more than $ 900 million in interest it ca n't pay. `` It is slowly but surely building up into another explosive situation,'' a Western political observer said on condition of anonymity. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is gathering forces with the southern and communist parties and the trade and professional unions, calling for implementing the peace initiative. This will sooner or later spill into the streets in demonstrations, and this could be ugly.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, called for <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s resignation in a New Year's Day radio broadcast from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. He suggested direct peace talks with Sudanese army generals, `` especially those fighting in the south.'' Defending his views on the agreement, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> told union leaders, `` We do not disagree on the peace issue, but there are specific points in the initiative that have to be resolved.'' He agreed to form a committee with the union leaders to discuss possible solutions to the civil war and the economic situation.

 Rival Shiite Moslems fought with grenades in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and rockets in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s shattered apple orchards Monday, the third day of their latest battle in a sporadic war that began nine months ago. Police said eight people were killed and 25 wounded in the Shiite slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and five were slain and 14 wounded in fighting near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` security zone'' along the border. Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation radio said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was sending Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> to negotiate peace between Amal, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militia backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which is strong in the slums and has tried to expand in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The report gave no details. Twenty people have been killed and 47 wounded since the fighting began Saturday, said a police spokesman, whose name can not be used under standing rules. Syrian peacekeeping troops called a `` total and comprehensive'' cease-fire at midday, but it collapsed four hours later. Bulldozers demolished sandbag barricades and earth mounds set up by both sides along a stretch of the slums along the highway to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in black headbands hurled grenades in a charge backed by mortar fire and overran a police station in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> district, the spokesman said Amal militiamen responded with heavy fire from tanks stationed in nearby woods as a dozen policemen sprinted to safety under heavy rain, the spokesman added. He said the two sides were locked in house-to-house fighting in <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> and the neighboring district of Haret Hreik. Amal, a mainstream militia whose name means <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party of God -RRB- are struggling for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiites, the largest sect in the country. Each accuses the other of starting the latest battle, their most intense since November, when 40 people were killed and 87 were wounded during six days of fighting in west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said thousands of residents had been living in basements and bomb shelters since New Year's Eve in the Shiyah, <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hreik </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mesharafiyeh </LOCATION> slum districts. Several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> planned to review its deployment of 4,500 soldiers in the slums to `` improve their performance and prevent further fighting.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker and has about 40,000 soldiers in the country, including at least 7,500 in the Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It first sent troops into the 16 square miles of slums in May, after a three-week battle between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in which 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the current fighting is the most serious between <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> since four days in April in which 62 were killed and 150 wounded. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> police said Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> used mortars and rockets against each other's strongholds in <LOCATION> Iklim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Tuffah </LOCATION>, the `` apple province'' whose orchards have fallen victim to 13 years of sectarian and factional war. The region runs from <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> to the border `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established in 1985 when it withdrew most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after three years of invasion and ocupation. An Amal statement said its fighters drove <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen from <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jarjou </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arabsalim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Biswar </PERSON> villages with a two-pronged dawn offensive. One from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> communique said the assault was repulsed `` with God's help'' in two hours of heavy fighting, but <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> then `` clamped a siege on the area, preventing food and water supplies from moving in.'' It said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in the area belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of fundamentalist factions that raids the security zone, which is defended by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and and their predominantly Christian surrogate militia.

His latest film, based on <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s novel, is about a travel writer whose 12-year-old son has just died and whose wife has left him. <PERSON> Kasdan </PERSON> said he tried to follow the calm, cool tone of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s writing, but was concerned viewers used to action movies may not be able to give his new film the close attention it requires `` I worry that American audiences are not used to doing that anymore,'' <PERSON> Kasdan </PERSON> said. `` Everything is handed to them.

 `` The truth-tellers of the nation,'' have spoken out in a new book by and about teen-agers and their views and hopes. `` I'd like to be able to walk down <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> streets at midnight with the same ease I'd walk down the street at noon,'' one teen-ager, <PERSON> Tobdeleya </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said in `` Voices of Hope.'' <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Galesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, reflected on the maturation process. `` As people grow older, they begin to see things in shades of gray and not in simple black and white as they did as children,'' she was quoted in the book as saying. `` When I was a child, my dreams were simple and selfish. Now I hope for feelings, not things. I dream more for my friends and family, and less for myself.'' American teen-agers are `` incredibly idealistic'' and want to help solve society's problems, but often are frustrated because they think they lack the means to make a difference, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jao </PERSON>, an editor of the book. `` They honestly want to be able to talk to their parents and be involved in politics, but they're also very cynical because they do n't feel any real change can come'' from their efforts, said <PERSON> Jao </PERSON>, 20. `` Voices of Hope'' follows `` Teenagers Themselves'' and `` Voices of Conflict,'' a series researched by the staff of the student newspaper at <ORGANIZATION> Glenbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this western <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. Staff members of the Echo newspaper traveled to 35 cities, interviewed 2,000 students and collected questionnaires from 5,000 more in all 50 states, under the direction of journalism teacher and newspaper adviser <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON>. `` Teen-agers are unique because they are the truth tellers of the nation,'' <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON> said. Students interviewed, ages 14 through 19, ranged from the `` wildly hedonistic stereotype'' of the inner cities to the `` deeply religious'' of more rural areas, <PERSON> Jao </PERSON> said. `` As opposed to statistical studies ... we've tried for much more of a qualitative approach,'' said <PERSON> Jao </PERSON>, now an English student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. Students want an end to all forms of discrimination _ against them as young people and against minorities, <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON> said. They seek `` communication between generations, equal treatment for teen-agers, openness to all viewpoints, and awareness of social problems,'' said <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON>, who has been advising the newspaper for 21 years. Researchers also interviewed adults such as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., for perspectives on issues that most concern teen-agers Nobel Prize-winner <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, asserts that science education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` bloody awful.'' And <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, director of youth ministries at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, suggests ways the church can elevate the moral fiber of young people. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said of teen-age drinking: `` Teen views and adult views do n't really differ ... when it comes to handling pressure ... because we handle it about the same way. Our parents drink, and so do we.'' <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, talked about morals. `` In order to know what is right or wrong ... consult the Bible. Unfortunately, in an increasingly immoral society, people succumb to their natural urges rather than overcome them,'' she said. `` One reason I believed sex should only happen within the marriage vows came from the examply my parents ` supposedly' set,'' said a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> girl who was not identified by name. `` When I found out a year ago that my parents were married in'69 instread of'68, making me a child conceived out of wedlock, I was shocked and confused.'' The ideal family was on the mind of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Aretta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uniontown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` The perfect family would be one that is always there for you even if you're wrong ... one that understands the feelings of a teen-ager and realizes we will make plenty of mistakes,'' she said. <PERSON> Jao </PERSON> said the book is a challenge to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to find ways for teen-agers to channel their hopes and enthusiasm. `` Teens are incredibly idealistic,'' he said. `` There's a real frustration people perceive as apathy, that they do n't know how to channel that energy. We need to find ways to channel that incredible idealism.'' The book and the two others in the series were published by <PERSON> Adama </PERSON> Books of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and is available at major bookstores nationwide.

 Four teen-agers who died in an accidental pipe-bomb explosion apparently were building the powerful device for fun, not for political or criminal reasons, according to reports published Monday. `` They were all bright kids. ... Everything points to kids looking at this as a challenge, like something they saw on TV and said, ` Hey, I can do that,''' an unidentified police official told The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun. Another police source, also unidentified, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the youths may have been planning a prank, `` like blowing up a flagpole or something.'' <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischman </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gafsi </PERSON>, 17, honor students who graduated last year from <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, were killed instantly Saturday when the bomb detonated, apparently as they were assembling it, police said. Two other youths, <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrone </PERSON>, 18, a freshman studying chemistry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>, 15, a sophomore at <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, died later at <LOCATION> Suburban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Soromenho-Ramos </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> classmate of the older youths, said his friends were fascinated with chemistry. `` They were probably going to go to some field and see how big a hole they could make,'' he said. `` They were peaceful people. They would never try to hurt anybody.'' The explosion occurred about 3:10 a.m. in a garage attached to a brick home rented by <PERSON> Machado </PERSON>'s parents. Because <PERSON> Gafsi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fischman </PERSON> were killed instantly, investigators believe they were standing over the pipe bomb when it exploded, <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geehreng </PERSON> said. Laboratory tests on metal and debris collected at the site by agents from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> were n't expected to yield any results until later this week, investigators said. <PERSON> Gafsi </PERSON>, a National Merit Scholar, was a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where his studies included Japanese and classical Arabic. <PERSON> Fischman </PERSON>, a first-year honors program student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, planned to major in chemistry and math. He had won prizes for his work in both subjects in high school, his family said.

 A resident of a cramped retirement home beat to death two sleeping residents with his walking cane and injured four others in a room-to-room rampage sparked by squabbles with roommates, police said Monday. There apparently was friction between <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 88, a retired fruit picker and sometime junk collector, and other residents of the Reflections I house, said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` There was some bitterness in the home between our suspect Mr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and the other residents of the home,'' he said. `` Evidently that bitterness, from what we can tell, had been building. Evidently, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, this thing came to a head and Mr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> took his action.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his 90-year-old roommate, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickbarge </PERSON>, and resident <PERSON> Myrtle </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 73. Charges were being prepared in the injuries to the other four residents and should be filed this week, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Nickbarge, 89-year-old <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tear </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> shared a 9-foot by 10-foot room, and the police chief said the cramped quarters may have contributed to the outburst. Tear, father-in-law of the home's owner <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tear </PERSON>, had a fractured skull and was in critical but stable condition Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 67, was in guarded condition at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with two broken arms, cuts on her face and head, and bruises. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, 71, and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 85, were both listed in fair condition Monday with facial cuts at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION> about 10 miles south of here. Ms. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> also suffered a broken collarbone. The bodies were discovered by staff nurses about 8 a.m. New Year's Day. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he believes the beatings took place between 1:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who walks with a cane, was found walking through <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a quiet town of 6,000 people northeast of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, 9:30 p.m. Sunday. He was described as jovial when confronted by police. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had not admitted to the crime, but police had strong physical evidence. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>'s cane and clothes were splattered with blood. Autopsies were planned Tuesday. `` We feel the murder weapon involved is the cane of Mr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` It is a heavy, oak-type cane.'' The chief said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` is a rather large individual who gets around better than most people think.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was being held without bond Monday. One of the nurses who found the bodies of <LOCATION> Nickbarge </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had slept only a few feet away from where the attack occurred, police said. `` Some furniture had been overturned, and there was broken glass on the floor,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuner </PERSON>. Nine people lived in the wood-frame home just outiside <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. All six victims had been sleeping in rooms near the front of the house, said <PERSON> Neuner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tear </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had problems getting along with the other residents and would grow angry at Nickbarge for moving things in the house. She said he also grew angry when his roommates squabbled. `` I would tell him if it bothers you, go away and walk for a little while,'' she said.

<HEAD>Arms Plants to Help Produce Farm and Food Machinery</HEAD>

 About 250 arms-making plants will be restructured and included in a plan to produce machinery for growing and processing food, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. `` A special program has been drawn up for the coming eight years that provides for the creation and mastering of the batch production of highly efficient equipment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch based on an interview with Deputy Premier <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Belousov </PERSON>. It said the new equipment was intended for smaller lease-contract farming operations as well as collective and state farms. Huge quantities of food are lost in transportation and storage in the highly centralized Soviet economy. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is promoting smaller farming operations, involved with specific tasks or parcels of land, to encourage farmers to work harder and produce more. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said research and design work on farming and processing machinery would increase seven-fold. `` Some 250 arms-manufacturing plants have been drawn into this work,'' it quoted <PERSON> Belousov </PERSON> as saying. `` Some industrial enterprises of this -LRB- arms -RRB- industry that were planned are being switched to peaceful production.'' He said Soviet defense policies should lead to arms production at a lower level still sufficient to defend the the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has recommended diverting some resources from the military to production of consumer goods.

 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency said Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using allegations about a chemical weapons plant as a pretext to attack the radical North African Arab nation and kill its leader, Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government officials announced they were examining the records of Imhausen-Chemie of <LOCATION> Lahr </LOCATION>, a company said to be involved in the purported plant. But no criminal investigation has begun into the activities of the company, local prosecutor <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Botz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON> rejected the accusations in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> that was broadcast late Monday. He said he hoped the government probe would clear his firm of any wrongdoing. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s JANA agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, noted that a report Sunday in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emirates </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted unidentified Arab sources as saying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> planned to send an assassination team to kill <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> during an attack on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> task force trained for the attack is in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and said it could come this month. It said the strike would include air raids on a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> nuclear research center at <LOCATION> Tajura </LOCATION> and the purported chemical weapons plant at <LOCATION> Rabtah </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said on Monday that a group it called the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in Defense of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> condemned the sailing of a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 13-ship carrier battle group for the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> called the sailing a routine deployment of the 6th Fleet. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said the new group comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Monday it had no officer on duty to answer questions. The report by <ORGANIZATION> Al-Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> report carried no dateline but appeared to originate in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals and exposes clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hysterical campaign'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has mounted against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It said the report proves <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations about a chemical arms plant `` were excuses and pretexts for an operation of premeditated individual murder.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is about to produce chemical weapons at the plant near <LOCATION> Rabtah </LOCATION>, about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the plant makes pharmaceuticals and stresses <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s commitment to treaties banning chemical weapons. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> discussed with other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> nations the possibility of military action against the plant. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, federal government spokesman <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> told a news conference authorities `` had no indication or evidence to verify the American suspicions'' that West German industry was involved. He said the allegations were brought to the government's attention during Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November, but <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had no `` concrete information'' to work with `` We must guarantee that German companies do not make profits from the construction of death factories in Third World countries,'' <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohnewald </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> state legislator from <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>, told reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>, where Imhausen-Chemie is located, issued a statement demanding a full probe into the allegations. The company's <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON> said Imhausen-Chemie had nothing to do with the Libyan factory, but had `` business contacts'' in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> relating to provision of materials for a plant to produce plastic bags. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karlheinz </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesch </PERSON> confirmed that a foreign trade investigation was launched Friday as a `` precautionary'' measure once <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> learned that the name of the German firm implicated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was to be made public. He said no evidence was uncovered to suggest Imhausen-Chemie was involved in wrongdoing. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesch </PERSON> said the investigation would try to find whether materials could have been shipped to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> indirectly through a third country. Companies from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are believed to have helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex, according to news reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> told the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> its citizens believed they were involved in building a fertilizer plant.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lawyers said Monday they would boycott military courts for one month to protest what they called a complete lack of due process for Palestinian detainees. The announcement coincided with the demolition of two homes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and came a day after the deportation of 13 Palestinians, fueling new charges of human rights violations by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, at least 10 Palestinians were wounded Monday in scattered clashes between troops and stone-throwing youths, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. The wounded included two girls, aged 12 and 14, reported in critical condition after being shot in the head during a clash at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Bureij refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. An army patrol came under a shooting attack near <LOCATION> Dahiriya </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but no injuries resulted. The army surrounded the village and conducted searches, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Palestinians staged a spontaneous strike to protest Sunday's deporations. Six of the deportees were from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. An army official denied the lawyers' allegations and defended Israeli actions to quell the nearly 13-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. `` We believe we have a liberal judicial system in the territories, but we should not be judged in the same context as Western countries that are not in a state of war,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Deportations and house demolitions `` are among our tools for maintaining control,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations have condemned such practices, saying they violate international human rights conventions. At a news conference, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Bahij </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamini </PERSON> said his clients were being denied their rights at every step in the military legal system as part of a strategy to crush the uprising, known by the Arabic word `` intefadeh.'' The boycott is a `` cry of protest, one last attempt to get through to the authorities,'' <PERSON> Tamini </PERSON> said. He said attorneys face difficulties in locating clients; attorneys frequently are barred from meeting with their clients; bail requests are routinely denied; and trial dates are often not coordinated with attorneys. `` We feel handcuffed and chained ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Tamini </PERSON>. Added colleague <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>: `` Lawyers should be allowed to be lawyers, instead of being collaborators in a system that pretends to be legal, but is n't.'' Palestinian lawyers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have been boycotting military courts for a year to protest similar conditions. <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> lawyer who represents Palestinian clients, said she feared deportations and other strict measures would increase under the government formed last month by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The army official sharply denied the lawyers' allegations. He said that earlier, the sheer numbers caused delays in helping lawyers to find clients, but now the army has set up a special office to help lawyers find their clients. Attorneys are not barred from seeing clients, trial dates are coordinated with lawyers, and bail has been granted in hundreds of cases, he said. In mid-December, 5,542 Palestinians were in detention, including 2,370 awaiting charges, 1,380 awaiting trial, 442 convicted and 1,350 held without charges for up to six months in so-called adminstrative detention, the army said. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lawyers estimated that since the beginning of the uprising, nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been jailed at one time or another. In addition to the detentions, 49 Palestinians have been deported since the beginning of the uprising, compared with 43 in the three-year period from January 1985 to November 1987. Since the uprising, the army has demolished or sealed 151 houses in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including two bulldozed Monday in the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp, according to the Palestinian human rights group Law in the Service Man. Thirty-eight houses also were reported torn down or sealed in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army official said deportations were carried out selectively and only as a last resort. Houses usually are torn down before the owners are convicted of any crime.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The former mayor of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> blamed for the church massacre of 12 people has fled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> after receiving a safe-conduct pass from the military government. <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> on Saturday after spending three months in the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. He was given political asylum in the embassy after the Sept. 17 military coup that brought Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to power. The ministry statement, issued Sunday, did not say where <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> had gone, but he was believed to be in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. He was given an official pass assuring his safe departure at the request of the Dominican government, the ministry said. In the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> was in the country on Sunday. The newspaper quoted sources in the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> as saying <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> was taken to the border in an embassy automobile under military escort. Once at the border, <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, where he is staying with friends, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacional </PERSON> said <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>'s wife and a son left the embassy two weeks earlier. But it did not say whether they also traveled to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, declined comment. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, who has not been charged, was accused of directing the Sept. 11 massacre at a Roman Catholic church in a <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> slum. Attackers armed with guns, machete knives and spikes killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 others. The <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>'s departure did not `` prejudice the legal proceedings'' against him, but did not elaborate. The former mayor was a reputed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the dreaded militia set up during the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship, and perpetrators of the church massacre were identified as City Hall employees. The soldiers who overthrew Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in September said they were provoked by the atrocity and wanted to end state-sponsored violence. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> fled to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and remains there with his wife and daughter. In November, the government announced it was investigating <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> for unspecified crimes. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>'s departure would have `` an adverse effect on the human rights credibility of the Haitian government.'' `` <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> was one of the big bosses of the paramilitary gangs in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> said. `` The granting of a safe-conduct pass is especially disturbing now that we all are expecting spectacular measures on the part of the government to eliminate these gangs from national life.'' <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has pledged to purge the army of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION> and carry out sweeping democratic reforms. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led the military junta that assumed power when dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> assumed the presidency in 1971 on the death of his father, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who was elected president in 1957.

<HEAD>Stiff Winds in Rockies, Fog Over Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Shifting air masses brought wind gusts of more than 70 mph blasting through parts of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on Monday, while parts of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> were encased in dense fog. Winds gusted to 71 mph at <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and gusts of up to 75 mph were expected throughout the day in the upper <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The stiff winds were being caused by the difference in air masses _ one over the central intermountain region, the other over the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> _ that created a pocket of rapid pressure change allowing the winds to howl through the eastern slopes of the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. Winds of up to 75 mph were reported in the northeast foothills of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Rollinsville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Squaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. High wind warnings also were issued for northwest <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where gusts of 46 mph were clocked at <LOCATION> Rawlins </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>. A stationary front over the southern Plains brought light rain and dense fog to northern and central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Light snow fell over northeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and northwest Missouri. Scattered showers dotted the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. West and northwest winds swirling around a low pressure center over southwest <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> brought widespread snow to eastern <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The same pressure system also produced snow over western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A warm front curved across parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and snow fell over <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Two inches of new snow fell at Caribou, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Temperatures continued to plummet below zero over eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. In Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, it was 15 below zero with a wind chill of minus 45. On the other extreme, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had a record high for the date of 85, breaking the mark of 84 degrees set in 1967. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13 below at Grand Forks to 89 at <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The nation's low for the morning was minus 32 at <LOCATION> Warroad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. Tuesday's forecast called for scattered snow from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> into northern parts of the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> into southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and scattered rain from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into the Gulf Coast Snow also was likely from eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, with widespread rain across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. High temperatures should be in the 30s and 40s across much of the nation, dipping into the teens and 20s from the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> through the Great Lakes into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Highs should warm into the 50s and 60s from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> through the southern Plateau and southern <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, the central high and southern Plains, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the southern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Highs should be in the 70s from southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, rising into the 80s over the central and southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Its Air Force Is Nearing Self-Sufficiency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Iranian Premier <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussavi </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is nearing military self-sufficiency by building an advanced fighter plane and maintaining its aging U.S.-made F-4 and F-5 fighters, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reported. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mussavi </PERSON> spoke after inspecting Iranian air force facilities, but showed footage of only one single-propeller trainer plane said to be locally built. <PERSON> Mussavi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now was able to repair its U.S.-made Hawk surface-to-air missiles without outside help. He also said an Iranian-made passenger plane was tested successfully and could be used for flights between smaller provincial cities, according to the TV report. It quoted <PERSON> Mussavi </PERSON> as saying that the Iranian navy now was overhauling <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 passenger planes, which used to undergo maintenance abroad at considerable expense. A Tehran-based foreign military attache said he was `` highly skeptical'' about Iranian claims of self-sufficiency in producing and maintaining aircraft. He spoke to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on the condition of anonymity. The source said both the Iranian military and Iranair, the national airline, lacked the skills and equipment needed for such operations. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Boeings were regularly serviced in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that complex maintenance operations are done abroad, or by foreign engineers specially flown in for the purpose. Asked about Iranian claims of building an advanced fighter, he said: `` If the Iranians had been successful ... they would be the first ones to roll it out and show it to the world. ... We in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> have seen nothing.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been seeking to rebuild its air force after the cease-fire last August in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Before the war started in September 1980, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had 447 combat aircraft _ 190 F-4s, 166 F-5s, 77 F-14s and 14 RF-4 reconaissance jets. Because of a chronic lack of spare parts, due to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms embargo and combat losses, Western analysts estimate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now has about 50 planes operational _ 20 F-4s, 20 F-5s, and 10 F-14s, some without radar.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi says the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been dismantled and he hopes for better cooperation with Jewish groups in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a Jewish organization said Monday. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayevitch </PERSON>, the chief rabbi, made the announcement in a letter sent Monday to the <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shayevitch </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a two-week visit. American Jewish leaders said in December they were told by letter that the committee, which generated propaganda against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, would be dismantled by the end of the year. The letter to prominent Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> purportedly was written by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zivs </PERSON>, a Soviet lawyer who helped found the committee in 1983. <PERSON> Beker </PERSON> said Monday about the chief rabbi's letter: `` The significance is that from now on Jewish organizations can have normal relations with the Soviet rabbis and we can start working together toward building a normal communal life for Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said in an interview the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had boycotted <PERSON> Shayevitch </PERSON> and other Soviet rabbis before the letter was written. The <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a government-sponsored body, included some well-known Jewish personalities in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and has been a source of embarrassment for Jewish groups dealing with officials of Soviet Jewry. It was intended to lend credibility to anti-Israeli policies the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> followed until recently. <PERSON> Shayevitch </PERSON> said in the letter to <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Beker </PERSON>: `` In my meetings here ... I announced unequivocally that I am not a member of the anti-Zionist committee and that the committee was dismantled. Furthermore ... I regret that such a committee existed in the past, but I emphasize that I have never participated in actions against Jews or the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He said he `` understood ... this announcement could clear the way for working relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Beker </PERSON> reported. Israeli Jews have accused <PERSON> Shayevitch </PERSON> of lacking interest in Jewish culture. He is appointed by the Soviet government and presides over the Grand Synagogue in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last Tuesday with <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Levite </PERSON>, chief rabbi of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, on the first trip to the Holy Land by Soviet religious leaders since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. They are guests of the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> religious council. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured territory from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. Relations have improved recently, and the governments have exchanged low-level diplomatic missions. The Soviets allowed 19,300 Jews to emigrate in 1988, and the December emigration figure reached a nine-year monthly high of 3,650, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday.

 A close-knit community grieved Monday over the loss of 10 people in a New Year's Day fire whose cause investigators said may never be known. A mother who lost four children in the blaze remained hospitalized Monday after becoming hysterical, and an elementary school called on a crisis intervention team to counsel children who lost five classmates. `` I have a suspicion we may never be able to determine the source of this fire,'' said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>, a deputy state fire marshal, as he surveyed the smoldering ruins of the home that caught fire early Sunday, killing eight children and two adults. `` The extent of the fire makes it very difficult.'' Arson has been ruled out, and a fuel oil space heater appeared to have been turned off, <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> said, but a wood-burning stove, electrical problems, smoking material, a Christmas tree and children playing with matches all were being investigated as possible sources of the fire. <PERSON> Remer </PERSON> Fire Chief <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Renn </PERSON> said the fire spread so quickly it was unlikely anyone woke up before being overcome by smoke. Three walls and the roof of the two-story house already had collapsed when firefighters in the north-central <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town of about 400 people arrived at 2:25 a.m., <PERSON> Renn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who returned home from celebrating her 32nd birthday with her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, to find her house in ashes, became hysterical and repeatedly tried to rush inside, authorities said. She remained hospitalized Monday. Killed were the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s four children, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, 14, <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>, 11, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 8; Mrs. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s sister and brother-in-law, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Smischney </PERSON>; their two children, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, 8; and two neighbor children, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastle </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastle </PERSON>, 12. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>, 18, a stepsister of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, told investigators Monday the house had three smoke detectors. <PERSON> Renn </PERSON> had said earlier there were no smoke detectors in the home, but when told of <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>'s comment he said he may have been wrong The fire was discovered by passing motorists, who stopped at the home of Melody Berczyk across the road. `` It was one big ball of flame right then,'' said <PERSON> Berczyk </PERSON>, who called the fire department. She said she had looked out the window a half-hour earlier before going to bed and saw no flames. `` The whole town is in shock. I'm still in shock,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilstead </PERSON>. Friends and neighbors set up a memorial fund at a bank and donation cans in a cafe. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Doro </PERSON>, principal of the 147-student elementary school which five of the children attended, said he has asked for a crisis intervention team to come to the school Tuesday. `` Being a small elementary school, it's like one big family. I really do n't know what's going to happen,'' <PERSON> Doro </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, we'll just all pull together.''

<HEAD>Prominent Virologist Dies At 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON>, a prominent virologist who was on the team that discovered the influenza virus, has died at the age of 92, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON>, a leader of research into the causes of the common cold, died Saturday, the newspaper said. The place and cause of death were not specified. He had been deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> from 1952 until 1961. The son of a pathologist, <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON> began his career in the same field, starting with a post as an assistant resident physician at the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institution in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he stayed for two years. He decided to concentrate on virology, a field in which he spent nearly 40 years. In 1927, after returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he joined the scientific staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON> worked with colleagues on the role of viruses in transmissible tumors in animals. In 1933, in collaboration with <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidlaw </PERSON>, he carried out the successful transmission of influenza to ferrets. From 1946 to 1960 the virologists strove to isolate the virus in the laboratory. Shortly before <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON>' 1961 retirement, a team he was part of isolated several viruses from patients with colds. The search then continued in many countries for the possibility of using a specific virus vaccine against cold viruses. A member of many government committees, <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON> was a former president of the Pathological section of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Andrewes </PERSON>' wife, the former <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, died in 1984.

Last week, the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Seyasseh </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the organization was considering a request by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> help in tracking down those responsible for the bombing. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, however, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had received no communication from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said on Sunday, in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television program `` Meet the Press,'' that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has `` a wealth of information'' that could help in the investigation of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 that killed 270 people. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after his flight from <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One, a reporter called out, `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> says he wants to help find the bomber.'' `` We've not heard from him,'' the president replied. `` We'll be happy to hear from him. If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure he'll tell us.'' The president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are staying at the home in the fashionable <LOCATION> Bel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where they will live after his term ends Jan. 20.

<HEAD>TV Movie Sparks More Than 500 Calls For Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 500 people nationwide called a toll-free number for information about anorexia nervosa after watching a television movie about singer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, who died as a result of the eating disorder. When `` The Karen Carpenter Story'' was broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Sunday night, many affiliate stations displayed the toll-free telephone number of a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> center devoted to treating eating disorders. Since the number, 800-334-8415, appeared, the <ORGANIZATION> Renfrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has received more than 500 calls asking for information, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, the center's director of admissions, said Monday. `` We expected the explosion of interest,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. `` We put in extra telephone lines to handle the calls.'' The center is sending callers a brochure with basic information about the disorder and a list of self-help centers throughout the country, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Menaged </PERSON>, a co-founder. `` We were at the phones until 3 a.m.'' Monday, <PERSON> Menaged </PERSON> said. `` The calls started trickling in from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, then as the night went on, I noticed we were talking to -LRB- people in -RRB- <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> and her brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, recorded 20 top 10 hit songs during the 1970s, singing such tunes as `` Close to You,'' `` Top of the World,'' `` We've Only Just Begun,'' and their No. 1 remake of `` Please Mr. Postman.'' She died in 1983 of heart failure due to anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by an obsession with weight loss and an aversion to food. Although the disorder primarily affects women _ especially young women _ no pattern to the calls existed, Ms. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. A number of callers also asked about bulimia, an eating disorder characterized by binging then purging the body of food. `` In the movie, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> had recovered but died several months later,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. `` She had done so much damage to her body. ... She was n't able to make it.'' Recovered anorexics should continue to receive therapy or support, Ms. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said, so they will be aware of their continued needs. She said the center normally gets about 100 calls per week from people seeking information about the disorder.

<HEAD>Four Communists Jailed On Charges Of Promoting Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Four leading members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were jailed Monday, and President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s military government charged them with promoting political violence Those ordered to jail by civilian Judge <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kockish </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Mireya </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherping </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Baltra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> served in the elected government of the late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist ousted by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in a 1973 coup. The Communists and two other radical leftist groups were made illegal by the 1980 constitution, which the military wrote. The indictments and jailings coincided with the party's 67th anniversary. As the defendants arrived at the court building Monday, other party members presented them with anniversary cakes. They smiled and ate the cakes while court guards watched without intefering. Charges of promoting political violence stem from a document they issued Dec. 6th announcing the party's first national congress in two decades. It document urged a `` popular rebellion'' and supported `` all forms of struggle,'' including violence, against the government. Party officials said the congress, expected to last months, began later in December at clandestine locations. Attorney General <PERSON> Ambrosio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said the Communist document violated the internal security law, which makes promoting political violence a crime. According to the indictments, the party proclamation amounted to `` an apologia for political violence, urging the overthrow of the goverment and the formation of armed popular militias.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, the interior minister, said action was taken against the Communists `` to demonstrate the government's determination to have a peaceful transition to democracy. <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON>, one of the defendants, said the government wants to `` prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in the country's political life.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Austerity Plan May Impair Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Critics of a government austerity plan said Monday some provisions could hurt the army by forcing cuts in weapons purchases or training programs. Ministers and legislators from both major political blocs accused Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of not working out the details of his plan before announcing it Sunday. His proposals call for controlling inflation by curbing cost-of-living pay increases and cutting about $ 600 million from government spending on the army, schools, hospitals and welfare. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who leads the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said his inflation target was 9 percent by the end of 1989, about half of the current annual figure of 18 percent. He did not say where spending cuts should be made, leaving that to a ministerial committee expected to convene Wednesday or Thursday. He began implementing the plan Sunday by reducing subsidies for food and gasoline. Prices of milk, bread and frozen chicken increased as much as 26 percent on Sunday morning. The government has devalued the shekel by 13 percent since last week as a first step toward reviving export industries hampered by a frozen exchange rate. Israeli news reports said the <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> plan calls for reductions of up to $ 353 million in the military budget, including $ 147 million allocated to army operations in the occupied territories, where Palestinians began a rebellion 13 months ago. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, also of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the army might have to reduce training, abandon a 10-year development plan and slow equipment purchases. `` This would seriously harm the army's ability and may destroy security-related industries in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It does not look justified to me.'' Other planned cuts are said to include up to $ 118 million in the education budget, which might force parents to pay tuition for kindergarten and high school, the radio said. Deputy Premier <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said price increases and reductions in spending on schools and welfare could negate a generation of progress and `` tear our society apart.

<HEAD>Cuba's Castro Says Cuba Will Shun Non-Socialistic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has an enormous responsibility to Third World countries to stick to its present hard-line Marxist-Leninist course, and he spurned market-oriented economic reforms. `` Today we say with more force than ever, socialism or death, Marxism - Leninism or death,'' he said His one-hour-and-54-minute televised speech Sunday night, celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution, was devoted mainly to praising the people of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other eastern <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> cities for their revoutionary heritage and support. It is the area <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> calls `` the cradle of the revolution.'' It was only toward the end of his address that <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> made remarks appearently directed toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other communist lands that have been veering from rigid adherence to Marxist doctrine. He did not refer directly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or to the economic and political reforms now being pushed by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying only that `` confusion'' marked the contemporary situation. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was more explicit about rejecting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies in earlier speeches. He acknowledged then that changes being attempted under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could cause `` difficulties'' for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and also said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will never embrace any reforms that `` reek of capitalism.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> addressed a large gathering on Sunday night from the balcony of the municipal building in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, where three decades before, on Jan. 1, 1959, he proclaimed victory for his revolutionary struggle. The president called the revolution a `` beacon of light before the eyes of the world.'' Cuban officials said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is expected to deliver a policy address on Wednesday. The friendship between <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seems more tenuous now than it has been for years, although it is far from rupture. The Soviets have chafed about the way <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has used the estimated $ 5 billion a year it receives in Soviet economic aid, and the question has arisen whether this will lead to cutbacks. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> thinks <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has neglected industrial development to spend the money instead on schools and hospitals. Despite <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s remarks on Sunday, the president now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with elected governments than in efforts to promote violent revolution, as he once did. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s recent commitment to withdraw its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by 1991 is one sign of dramatic policy change. He said while attending the presidential inaguration in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in November that he envisions the eventual unity of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> deported on Monday a Syrian who was held at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport after <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> refused to accept him because it suspected he was linked to a terrorist group, officials said.

 <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> made an encore appearance as grand marshal of the Rose Parade, which had its 100th outing on a picture-perfect Monday amid dozens of floats laden with blossoms, nostalgia and high hopes for 1989. In a Rose Parade first, <PERSON> Carie </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON> recited wedding vows before one of the largest audiences ever to witness a marriage ceremony. An estimated 350 million people in 32 countries watched on televison, while half a million thronged the curbside along the 5 -LCB- - mile route `` This is like a fairy tale come true. I'm so excited to show off my beautiful bride to everyone. It's a chance to show everybody what true love is about,'' said <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>, 23, who wed Ms. <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> 45 minutes into the parade. A grateful Vietnamese refugee rode one float. Cancer-stricken youngsters waved from another entry. The Rose Parade may be the grande dame of the New Year's processions, but <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' Cotton Bowl sought a little more limelight by adding more marchers, mimes, clowns and mascots to its 32nd annual parade Monday Country singer <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pride </PERSON> was grand marshal. The Orange Parade, held on New Year's Eve, attracted a half-million people to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to watch the floats, celebrities and circus elephants that filed by, while 22,000 marchers modeled outrageous costumes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s 89th annual Mummers parade on New Year's Day. `` You are not going to find one person from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> complaining,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Footlick </PERSON>, 21, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> student among the masses of Rose parade spectators basking in the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> sunshine and 60-degree weather. After the parade, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> were to square off in the Rose Bowl. Former ambassador <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who wowed the crowds 50 years earlier as grand marshal when she was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite child actress, led off the flower-bedecked flotilla promptly at 8 a.m. Police described the crowds as well-behaved. There were only 188 arrests, mostly for drunkenness, compared with 444 last year, said parade spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Veronda </PERSON>. Some of the more spectacular of the 60 floats included the tallest in parade history, a 75-foot flowered-covered giraffe by <ORGANIZATION> Carnation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Casablanca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> float featuring a ski run and breath-taking flips by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Stuntmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Vietnamese refugee <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, riding the Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> float, reveled in the celebration: `` I feel very great. I'm really happy It's the best New Year's I have ever had.'' `` Life's important, it's the most important thing in the world,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rydberg </PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION> Oxnard </LOCATION>, whose liver cancer has been in remission since 1986. She rode a float with other children with cancer. Eighteen floats won trophies, including <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Mardi Gras,'' the Sweepstakes winner, depicting a giant masked reveler with a 26-foot headdress. Slice soft drink's `` Luau,'' which won the Grand Marshal's Trophy for its tropical island complete with waterfalls and dancers, broke down and never made an appearance. It was the first float ever to miss the parade, officials said. The City of Alhambra-City of Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, float, <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s entry and the Pac-10 float also had mechanical troubles and had to be dragged down <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> via tow trucks _ the only parade vehicles not adorned with flowers Carnation's giraffe float broke down but was repaired and did n't need towing. Rose Queen <PERSON> Charmaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shryock </PERSON> reigned with her court on a float followed by another reuniting many former Rose Queens, including 80-year-old <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsted </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthis </PERSON>, the 1930 parade monarch. More than 20 million roses, chrysanthemums, orchids, carnations, marigolds, sweet peas, iris, daisies, daffodils, tulips and other flowers festooned the floats. Twenty marching bands and 275 horses rounded out the two-hour procession. Some of the television audience watched the festivities with special 3-D glasses provided by <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. In previous years, police agencies have estimated a crowd of about 1 million spectators, but this year declined to do so, saying the number was difficult to arrive at. The <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-News </ORGANIZATION> conducted its own head count using a formula worked out by a retired <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> physicist, arriving at an estimate of 500,000. About 650 pompon dancers led off the <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parade </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, followed by 13 floats, three giant balloon figures, 15 bands and five equestrian units. Some 100,000 spectators watched for the parade under overcast skies and 55-degree weather, and millions more saw an hour of the event on TV. Organizers had tripled this year's parade budget to $ 225,000 from last year to try to bring the parade out of the shadow of the Rose and Orange parades. Afterward, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> vied for the Cotton Bowl title. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> was to play the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> in the Orange Bowl Monday night but <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had its parade Saturday. Among the celebrities waving from the floats were <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, `` L.A. Law'' star <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttan </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> of `` Cheers'' and <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> of `` Amen.'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garagiola </PERSON> were the masters of ceremonies. And in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, spectators clustered along the 2 -LCB- - mile Mummers parade route were treated to 14 hours of string bands competing for more than $ 286,000 in prize money and clowns who cakewalked to the event's perennial theme, `` Oh, Dem Golden Slippers.

The White House announcement came hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he is sure <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has information about the Pan Am bombing. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment came in response to a reporter's question as he arrived here to complete a holiday stay which began Dec. 23 and will end Thursday when he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said that <PERSON> Balaoui </PERSON> took note of <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>'s views during the weekend meeting and told him he would pass them on to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The official said the discussion did not amount to a request by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> assistance, but was in line with the administration's position that it will welcome information from any source that would help to solve the bombing. The administration official said the meeting was not a continuation of the dialogue between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives which began Dec. 16 in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> met with three members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said there are no current plans for a further meeting as part of this dialogue. He declined other comment on a report, attributed to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Faidy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in an interview with <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> state radio, that such a meeting was scheduled for Saturday. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was aware of the meeting between <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Balaoui </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent the New Year's weekend in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where he said in his weekly radio address Saturday that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shares his determination to bring the bombers of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane to justice. Last week, the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Seyasseh </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the organization was considering a request by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> help in tracking down those responsible for the bombing. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said the White House had received no communication from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said on Sunday, in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television program `` Meet the Press,'' that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has `` a wealth of information'' that could help in the investigation of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 that killed 270 people. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after his flight from <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One, a reporter called out, `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> says he wants to help find the bomber.'' `` We've not heard from him,'' the president replied. `` We'll be happy to hear from him. If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure he'll tell us.'' The president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are staying at the home in the fashionable <LOCATION> Bel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where they will live after his term ends Jan. 20. The only public event on their schedule before their return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a fund-raising dinner Wednesday night on behalf of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign against drug abuse.

<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan rebel leaders on Monday told Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> they are willing to attend peace talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the leftist Nicaraguan government. `` We have the honor of confirming to you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, our willingness to reach a political solution to the conflict and that we have decided to accept <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as the city where negotiations with the Sandinista government should continue,'' the leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the rebels' political organization, told <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> in a letter. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is the author of a 1987 peace plan for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that calls, in part, for negotiated solutions to civil conflicts in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. A tenuous cease-fire agreement between the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> has been in effect since March. Negotiations on a permanent end to the seven-year-old civil war broke down in September. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> suggested in September that future talks take place either in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital, or in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has trained, funded and supplied the rebels since 1981 in their war to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The Contras proposed in their letter on Monday that negotiations with the Sandinista government begin Jan. 25 at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed that <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Suares </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and the foreign ministers of the five Central American governments act as witnesses to the talks. The Resistance leaders said they were willing to call an end to rebel military operations in exchange for democratic reforms by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. They also called for effective measures by a verification commission to monitor <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> compliance with the peace plan, which provides for democratic guarantees. `` We consider it urgent that viable mechanisms be established to guarantee the independence of the -LRB- peace plan -RRB- verification commission,'' said the letter, signed by <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> directors <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>. The rebel message came after Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> confirmed he plans to attend a summit of Central American presidents scheduled for Jan. 15-16 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, to advance the stalled peace plan. The summit had been threatened by Nicaraguan claims that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, has been harboring and supporting the Contras. Most Contra fighters fled to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid expired in February. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, agreed last month to hear a formal Nicaraguan complaint against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> over the rebels' presence in that country. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision prompted <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> to threaten to boycott the summit unless <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> dropped its case. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would also boycott a preparatory meeting of Central American foreign ministers in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> did n't withdraw its complaint, he said. In addition, <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> threatened to file a countersuit against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> charging Sandinista army troops with repeated incursions into Honduran territory. But <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> confirmed he would attend the summit during a nationally broadcast New Year's message on Saturday.

 After weeks of delay, a cargo plane loaded with 42 tons of food, blankets and medical supplies for Armenian earthquake victims departed Monday bound for the Soviet republic. On board were two physicians who will evaluate medical conditions there and propose to Armenian authorities the establishment of `` a steady stream of doctors, equipment and drugs going back and forth on a regular basis,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Carolann </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. It was the first such airlift from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> since the Dec. 7 quake that killed an estimated 25,000 people and left 500,000 people homeless. The supplies, donated from all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been piling up at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> since the day after the quake and nearly filled a large hangar provided by <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as a staging area. Monday's airlift delivered only about a quarter of the supplies. `` In this hangar, we've got $ 8 -LRB- million -RRB- to $ 10 million worth of equipment,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarian </PERSON>, east coast chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outreach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION>, a relief group. `` We need about two or three more flights.'' <PERSON> Nazarian </PERSON> said he hoped to arrange another airlift for the remainder of the supplies next week. Twelve private relief planes have departed from other cities, said <PERSON> Dikran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaligian </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But two weeks ago, before transport could be arranged from <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, the Soviets called a temporary halt to shipments to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in order to take stock of which supplies were needed, and where, he said. Armenian church and relief officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meanwhile, have been reluctant to airlift cargo without sending their own people along to ensure the supplies reach the quake victims for whom they are intended, <PERSON> Kaligian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kaligian </PERSON> said he knows of no relief supplies that have gone astray, but the Armenians are taking no chances. `` They could divert it to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, they could take everything,'' he said. `` We've had our personnel on board.'' The cargo plane and crew were provided by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and owned by Armenian-Americans. Medical Outreach paid for fuel and operating costs, <PERSON> Nazarian </PERSON> said. The plane, loaded with bales of blankets, food, tents and medical supplies ranging from antacids to antibiotics, left <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> at about 4:10 p.m. The schedule for the 14-hour trip to the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> included a stop at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, officials said. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., Gov <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> were at the airport at noon for a news conference on the plane's departure. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the supplies being stored in the hangar reflect `` the affection <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents have for the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.'' The two physicians, <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aghababian </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, said they wanted to set up a microbiology laboratory in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to help test for infectious diseases, which can spread after disasters. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to help raise the money for the laboratory if it turns out to be needed.

<HEAD>Police To Seek Charges Against Four in Boat Sinking</HEAD>

charges against four will be sought. No pickup</HEAD>

 A police chief said Monday he will seek homicide charges against two cruise operators and two port guards in the capsize-sinking of a tourist boat that drowned at least 51 people on New Year's Eve. Also Monday, the navy released a report saying that the vessel was inspected twice on the week it sank, including on the day of the sinking. The report conflicted with statements by witnesses who said no attempt was made to control the number of people who boarded the double-deck excursion vessel, <PERSON> Bateau </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouche </PERSON>, and that few life jackets were available. Widely conflicting reports emerged about how many people were on the 100-foot-long boat when it sank and how many may still be missing. The navy said its inspectors examined the boat on Wednesday, finding `` satisfactory safety and navigational conditions'' and `` a number of life jackets above what was necessary.'' A patrol boat intercepted the vessel at 9:30 p.m. Saturday, just over two hours before it capsized, and navy inspectors found `` 149 people aboard ... within a permitted capacity of 153,'' the statement said. `` The vessel therefore was given clearance,'' the navy declared, and its Port Authority for <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> had a `` perfectly clear conscience of duty carried out.'' `` Rumors of bribes or negligence'' involving men from the patrol boat who made the last inspection will be investigated, it said. Police Chief <PERSON> Irineu </PERSON> <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON> of <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s 10th precinct, who is in charge of the case, said Monday he will seek criminal charges against the owner of <LOCATION> Itatiaia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turismo </LOCATION>, the Rio travel agency that booked the cruise; the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Sol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> e </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mar </ORGANIZATION> restaurant that operates the vessel; and two port authority guards who stopped the boat but allowed it to go on its way. <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON> said he will also seek charges of corruption and accepting bribes against the guards. No one has been arrested in the case. `` Survivors ... are telling us that something on board was not right,'' he had said Sunday. <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bateau </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouche </PERSON> was overcrowded and questioned why it resumed its trip after the patrol boat turned it back to the dock for inspection Saturday. A representative of the booking agent said the <PERSON> Bateau </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouche </PERSON> usually carried only 100 passengers. Tickets for the New Year's Eve cruise, to watch midnight fireworks off <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, cost $ 220 each. On Monday, the boat remained under 65 feet of water off <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loaf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, a Rio landmark near downtown. Rescuers said they may find more bodies but that most of the people who drowned probably were accounted for. `` We think that most of the bodies already have been taken out,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Albuquerque </PERSON> of the fire department maritime division, whose divers were inspecting the wreck. He added, however, that `` we ... may see some bodies washing up on <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s beaches in the next couple of days.'' <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest commercial network, carried reports of 30 bodies trapped in the boat's banquet room. It did not give the source of the reports. Col. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bem </PERSON>, head of the fire department maritime division, said in response: `` Our divers still do not have sufficient visibility to see what's inside -LRB- the room. -RRB- There are piles of tables and chairs in the way. The work is going very slowly.'' Survivors told journalists Sunday no effort was made to control the number of people boarding. They said few life jackets were available and life preservers were tied to the railing. They confirmed the forced return for the passenger count and said the craft went back out a few minutes later. Cid Castor of <PERSON> Itatiaia </PERSON> <PERSON> Turismo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> 100 tickets normally were sold for twice-daily sightseeing excursions on the Bateau Mouche. Confusion persisted about how many on the New Year's Eve cruise were passengers, crewmen, waiters, members of the samba band or others. <PERSON> Castor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Itatiaia </PERSON>'s excursion director drowned in the sinking and `` the passenger list went down with him.'' <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Sol e Mar restaurant, said an incomplete reservation list showed 106 passengers, eight band members, five waiters, one head waiter, the pilot and three crewmen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Sol e Mar, produced an incomplete list Sunday with 131 names, but said it did not include people accompanying those with reservations and `` we do n't know how many were on board.''

 The man who said he killed <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> ecologist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> will undergo a lie detector test to clear up contradictions in his statements about the shooting, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Deputy Justice Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that investigators have questions about the events that preceded the Dec. 22 shooting. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was shot as he stepped from his home in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle city of <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, 2,660 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, 21, the son of a local cattle rancher, said last Tuesday he killed <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, the president of the local <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tappers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> challenged local ranchers, who wanted to clear <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> land for cattle grazing. But <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> said, `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> -RRB- did shoot <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, he did n't act alone. The lie detector test can help us eliminate doubts.'' Police said earlier that <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> might be acting as a cover for his father, <PERSON> Darly </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> had said threatened to kill him. <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Oloci </PERSON>, 22, are being held in police custody, but their father and their uncle, <PERSON> Alvarino </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, are in hiding, possibly in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, according to press reports. `` That the <PERSON> Alves </PERSON> brothers may be hiding in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is a hypothesis we are examining. If confirmed, we will begin extradition procedings,'' <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> received the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Global 500 award for his ecological work to preserve the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forest. Ecologists say an area the size of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> is burned and chopped down each year in the jungle region that covers more than two-thirds of Brazilian territory. Ecologists say the reduction in tropical forest lands has contributed to the elevation of the Earth's temperature, which may have been a factor in the devastating drought in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this past summer. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>' death has drawn world attention to the old problem of land conflicts between landless peasant farmers and right-wing cattle ranchers. Since 1980, more than 1,000 peasants, ecologists and church leaders, who defend the peasants, have been killed in battles over land ownership in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.

 `` Wheel of Fortune'' host <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> and hip comic <ORGANIZATION> Arsenio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> say they wo n't try to dethrone the giants when they debut their own late-night talk shows. Instead, they will try to reach new audiences. `` I think people place too much emphasis on the competition. I'm running my own race,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, whose syndicated `` The Arsenio Hall Show'' airs Tuesday `` It's a personal best, it's me against me.'' Hall and <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> show debuts Monday, may have an uphill battle establishing themselves in a field already glutted with flashy _ even bizarre _ personalities. But their shows will have subtle differences from the current fare and each other. <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>, for instance, will have a desk.

 One man sought in the fatal shooting of a sheriff's deputy was arrested Monday, and a second was found dead after apparently committing suicide in a cabin where he had holed up, authorities said. The man arrested in connection with the New Year's Eve shooting of <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> was tentatively identified as <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. The second man, tentatively identified as <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savory </PERSON>, 45, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the face after police fired tear gas into the cabin near <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Earlier Monday, the man had fired at officers and a law enforcement helicopter and apparently killed himself afterward, <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. A 33-mile stretch of Interstate 40 was closed for about six hours, forcing drivers to make a 167-mile detour onto lesser routes to the north, because the cabin was less than a quarter-mile from the interstate. After the tear gas was fired, officers `` entered -LRB- the cabin -RRB- with orders to shoot to kill,'' said <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Savory </PERSON> was an extremely dangerous man,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` Every time we had contact with him, he turned on us. He shot Officer <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> before he even had a chance to react. He turned on two of our cars while we were trying to pursue him. Every time that we made contact with him, I ended up with several bullet holes in my patrol cars.'' The owner of the cabin called police Monday morning after he went there `` and recognized that something was amiss,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> warrant accused Savory of robbery and kidnapping in a September gun-store robbery in which five other people have been arrested, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. Savory also has been investigated in connection with manufacturing and sale of illegal weapons and explosives, and `` is well known to authorities at the -LRB- <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -RRB- state and federal level,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, he said, `` may be a citizen of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but we have very little on his background.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who was unarmed, was arrested without resistance in <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION> after an officer recognized him, police Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was turned over to sheriff's deputies for questioning, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Chief Deputy <PERSON> Arleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> would be treated at a <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> hospital for frostbite to his feet and then returned to <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION>, possibly on Tuesday, to be booked. <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> said it had not been determined what charges would be filed against <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Varner </PERSON>, 51, was shot three times Saturday night after he stopped a car with two suspects. He died at a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> hospital early Monday. The suspects, one of whom said he was a survivalist, later tied up a couple with telephone cord at their home. The men took the couple's car and fired on a second patrol vehicle; after a short chase, the two wrecked the car and fled on foot, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The racially divided town of <LOCATION> Keysville </LOCATION> held its first locally supervised election since the 1930s on Monday, re-electing the mayor and voting in her all-black council slate. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, the 67-year-old white challenger to Mayor <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON>, said he was n't surprised by the results after a ruling earlier Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Burke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registrars </ORGANIZATION> against challenges he had filed against 84 black voters. Mrs. <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> got 127 votes, while <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> got 61. In the council races, Mrs. <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON>'s slate won all five seats by similar margins. The ballots were counted Monday night after the county registrars denied two challenges filed by <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotkin </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit foundation that helped fight the challenges. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> had contended that the 84 voters he challenged did not live within the east <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town's boundaries. Thirty-five of the 84 live in a section that was annexed by the town last year. `` Since the town's boundaries have not been established, I ca n't see hardly how you can annex more property into it,'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, another attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, said the annexation was precleared by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and approved by the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secretary of state's office. In addition to the 35 voters living in the annexed area, `` they're challenging the same 49 people that were challenged in the last election,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. `` Those were nullified by the registrar at the end of the vote tallies. There is no reason for those people to be challenged again.'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, whose council slate included four whites and one black, said Monday night he would consult with his attorney before deciding whether to appeal the registrars' decision. The town is about 70 percent black and has about 230 registered voters. <PERSON> Keysville </PERSON>'s government was revived in January when Mrs. <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> and a slate of council members were elected to one-year terms. Monday's election, conducted under the town's original 1890 charter, was for 20-month terms. If the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approves a new charter, subsequent elections will be for four-year terms. For reasons lost to time, <PERSON> Keysville </PERSON> deactivated its government in 1933. In the 1980s, black residents tried to reactivate it to get water, sewers, fire and police protection, all of which the town lacked. There were problems defining boundaries, however, since the original charter described the city limits as everything within a half-mile radius of a schoolhouse demolished about 1895. White residents went to court to block the move to revive <PERSON> Keysville </PERSON>'s government. They denied they were worried about a possible black government and said their concern was that installing municipal services would tax poor blacks out of their homes. Mrs. <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> and a council were elected the first time in 1985, but white residents' contention that the town limits were not defined was upheld in court and the vote was thrown out. The state court issued an order forbidding the <LOCATION> Keysville </LOCATION> officials from taking office. Those opposed to reactivating the government used the same argument to try to prevent elections last year, but ultimately lost in federal court.

 A ferry overloaded with New Year's travelers sank off the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast after it ran out of fuel, leaving 67 people drowned and 14 missing, authorities said Monday They said 46 people survived. The ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II sank Sunday in <LOCATION> Amatique </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON>, second-in-command at the Puerto Barrios naval base. He said the 22-year-old captain, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezquibel </PERSON>, was arrested after authorities determined that 120 people were aboard the 30-ton ferry, although the manifest listed 40. The vessel was authorized to carry 90 people, he reported. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers found no bodies inside the wreck, he said. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON> said the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile run across the bay from <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> to Puerto Barrios, and sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaytan </PERSON>, a reporter at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portena </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrios </LOCATION>, said authorities who interviewed survivors believe the crew failed to take adequate precautions while preparing to be towed. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON> said passengers ran to one side of the ferry while it was under tow and the ferry sank. The Spanish Embassy in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said a 40-year-old Spaniard, <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Daudi </PERSON>, was among the dead. It said his wife, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnal </PERSON>, and a son survived, but two daughters were missing. <PERSON> Daudi </PERSON> was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic development mission in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the embassy said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday identified four people authorities say are members of a radical Palestinian faction planning to hijack or blow up an Asian airliner this month. <PERSON> Rollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Estabillio </PERSON>, spokesman for the airline, said the four are believed to be members of a breakaway <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> faction led by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>, who is supported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Estabillio </PERSON> said the names were provided in a telex sent by authorities at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last month. The message prompted increased security at <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> airports in the wake of the Dec. 21 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, in which 270 people were killed. He identified them as <PERSON> Mudh </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muhen </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Barani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Burani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasar </PERSON> and said they were believed to be carrying passports from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. He said officials at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ninoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> were carefully screening all passengers from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in view of the alert. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>, broke with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1983 because of opposition to peace moves with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and his anger over <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s failure to stop the Israeli 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Last week, Asian aviation officials said they were warned by Air-India of a possible attack on an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> aircraft by Jan. 10. <ORGANIZATION> Air-India </ORGANIZATION> refused comment, but sources in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said security was increased at airports in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>. Similar measures were ordered at airports in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. On Monday, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> deported a Syrian who was held at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport after <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> refused to accept him because it suspected he was linked to a terrorist group, officials said. Immigration authorities said two security men shepherded <PERSON> Vartan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakerjian </PERSON> onto a <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> flight bound for <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

 The 12-foot wall of water that gushed from a 300-foot-gap in a southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> dike was down to a trickle by Monday and residents cleaned up mud and debris from the flooded 50 homes and 100 apartments. No injuries were reported from the <ORGANIZATION> Quail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservoir </ORGANIZATION> break early Sunday that resulted in the evacuation of an estimated 1,500 along the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The dike failure, which also ruined four bridges and closed sections of area highways most of Sunday, prompted Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> to declare <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> an emergency disaster area. <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>'s declaration was necessary to open disaster relief coffers. A similar designation by the state <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> office is expected later this week, said <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> would reimburse up to 75 percent of the losses, with the remainder covered by state and local governments, <PERSON> Hafen </PERSON> said. Teams of local, state and federal engineers and other emergency service officials fanned out Monday to assess the damage in an effort to put a price tag on the dike break and help residents recoup their losses. The St. <PERSON> George </PERSON> suburb of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was hardest hit, with up to 40 homes flooded. <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said the $ 3 million dike, part of a reservoir and dam project 14 miles east of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>, will be rebuilt. After the dike gave way early Sunday, authorities ordered the evacuation of 1,500 people living along the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The haste with which the evacuation was carried out angered some residents who said they may have saved more property had they not been so rushed. Evacuations were ordered just after midnight but the water did not reach their homes until well after 3 a.m. `` We could have gotten a lot of stuff out if we had been given a more realistic time,'' said <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> apartment was flooded. `` We got the TV and the sewing machine out but there was a lot more we probably could have taken with us had we known.''

<TEXT>
 French and British broadcast reports said Monday that 17 trapped survivors of the Dec. 7 earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> were found in a wrecked bread factory after living for three weeks on grain and melted snow. The report could not be immediately confirmed. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, which has provided copious news on the rescue efforts, made no mention of the report. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1 radio quoted a nurse for the French humanitarian group Doctors of the World saying the 17 survivors were found in a bread factory near <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a village in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> that was virtually destroyed. The nurse was quoted as saying they stayed alive by eating grain and drinking melted snow. The nurse recently told a journalist at the station that the survivors were apparently found Wednesday, 21 days after the quake, and the report reached <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Saturday. The station had an earlier version of the report quoting the nurse as saying they were found Saturday. The male nurse spoke to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1 on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> commercial radio station <ORGANIZATION> LBC </ORGANIZATION> reported that French medics said the 17 were found Saturday, 24 days after the quake rocked northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. It also said they stayed alive by eating grain and drinking melted snow. It was not immediately possible to resolve the discrepancy over when the survivors were found. The radio reports gave no details on the conditions of the survivors or where they are now. The Associated Press was unable to reach by phone several regional government officials, relief groups, and press organizations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. One official at the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said he knew of a smaller group of survivors found Dec. 24 or 26, but he had no details and it was not known if he was talking about the same group. The quake killed an estimated 25,000 people in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and left about 400,000 homeless. It severely damaged <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a city of about 250,000 near <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s Deputy Prime Minister, <PERSON> Vardkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON>, said Dec. 23 that authorities were calling off the search because they did not expect to find more survivors. He said efforts would focus on rebuilding the southern republic. In the weeks after the quake, rescuers from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and abroad used dogs, heavy equipment, and often their own hands to pick through the wreckage in search of survivors. In many cases, they were guided by cries for help that sprang up from countless wrecked buildings. The relief efforts provided many dramatic tales of human endurance and resourcefulness. In one case, a woman trapped in her basement for eight days helped keep her 3-year-old alive by pricking her own fingers and letting the child suck her blood, a Soviet doctor said. Some people have sat in front of bulldozers to prevent the clearing of debris until it could be searched for survivors. Authorities wanted to bulldoze the rubble and spread quicklime to prevent the spread of disease from the corpses. The quake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was centered 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Leninaken </LOCATION>.

 Ringing in the new year are dozens of changes in federal laws and regulations, many of them aimed at quenching Americans' thirst for security and a few that will make life a little more expensive. Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vast expansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, faster pension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women, and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchases on credit. Others that occurred just before the end of 1988 or are scheduled early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private employers, 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating against the handicapped and families with children.

 <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> has lived twice as long as might have been expected when doctors diagnosed his AIDS. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cristofer </PERSON> <PERSON> Shihar </PERSON> had one chance in five of seeing 1984. They do n't know why they've survived what has been a death sentence for more than 45,000 Americans, but say it may be a matter of attitude. `` A lot of people do n't die of the disease, they die because they give up,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, a 34-year-old Chicagoan who was diagnosed with acquired immune deficienty syndrome in January 1984. He asked that his last name be withheld. According to <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> holistic therapist who says she has counseled hundreds of clients with AIDS or AIDS-related problems, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> is one of many people with the disease who are well enough to feel and act normal. `` There are a lot of healthy people running around with AIDS,'' she said. Scientists are trying to determine just why some people have survived as long as 10 years with AIDS. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is studying 119 people known to have lived with it for three or more years. `` Is the virus somehow different?'' asks <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist now at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>, Md. `` Is it something in their immune system?'' Does survival time hinge on the mildness or severity of the infections that attack people with AIDS? Or could the key really be a `` lifestyle-psychosocial type of thing'' _ a positive attitude and emotional support? All of these possibilities are now being studied, either by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> or in studies funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. For the purposes of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s 2-year-old study, long-term survivors were defined as people who lived at least three years after being diagnosed. Unlike the estimated hundreds of thousands of Americans who are infected with the AIDS virus but do not have symptoms, long-term survivors actually have battled one or more ailments that define acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ including <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, pneumonia, damaged immune systems and severe weight loss. Most long-term survivors are white homosexual men in their 30s whose main or only symptom is <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma, the skin cancer that was rare before AIDS became an epidemic, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> data indicates. `` The major issue people are interested in is what way the immune response for the long-term survivor is different than in the short-term survivor,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Masur </PERSON>, deputy chief of critical care medicine at the the Clinical Center of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` With any disease, whether it's cancer or pneumonia, in a healthy person, some people get sick very quickly and die and other people survive much longer. With breast cancer or colon cancer, some people will be dead within a few months and some people will go for 30 years,'' <PERSON> Masur </PERSON> said. For <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, an accountant, three years of chemotherapy kept the skin sores of <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s sarcoma at bay. He then began treatment with the drug AZT, now called zidovudine, which prolongs the lives of many with AIDS. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, who considers himself `` fairly lucky,'' said his only current health problem is mild leg pain. `` I'm basically as normal as they get. Nobody would know, if they saw me on the street, that I had been diagnosed with AIDS.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was diagnosed with <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s in February 1982, before most Americans _ including doctors _ had heard of AIDS. `` I do believe one can live with AIDS and strike up a bargain and co-exist with the virus, as we do with other viruses,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. He underwent chemotherapy, a year of acupuncture, took megadoses of Vitamin C for a while, has taken zidovudine intermittently since early 1988 and still gets alpha-interferon, a genetically engineered anti-cancer drug. `` I go to the gym regularly, and I try to maintain my weight and my energy level,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who writes and performs music. `` A friend and I have just finished writing a movie script, which we hope to sell.'' <PERSON> Shihar </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was diagnosed with <PERSON> Kaposi </PERSON>'s in November 1982, and said he's done `` just about the opposite of all the recommended treatments'' but his illness went into remission anyway. `` I would love to say it was all very spiritual, but I was in remission before I became spiritual,'' said <PERSON> Shihar </PERSON>, who works for Northern Lights Alternatives, a New York-based education and support organization for people with AIDS. `` I think the one thing I hear from people I know who have survived is they're real stubborn.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wiker </PERSON> believes `` there is a certain kind of person that is a survivor with AIDS. That kind of personality is one that starts living in the moment, a person that is letting go of their past feelings and fears ... and they're letting go of future projections about death.'' That theory is being tested in a federally funded study at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, where 450 people infected with the AIDS virus are being tracked for five years to determine whether their emotional state influences their resistance to the illness. `` Most people would like to believe they have control over this, and if they remain optimistic and cheerful it will help,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> and Surgeons and principal investigator in the study. `` And we certainly want to encourage people to remain optimistic and cheerful, but we do n't really know if it makes a difference or not, and that's what we're trying to see,'' he added. Regardless of psychological factors, survival prospects continually improve in newly diagnosed AIDS cases, thanks to drug treatments such as zidovudine and an aerosol form of pentamidine, a medication that fights the rare type of pneumonia that has been highly fatal to AIDS patients. As recently as two years ago, 80 percent of people with AIDS were expected to die within 24 months, but that has changed dramatically, said Dr. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pier </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> physician with a large number of AIDS patients. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> says it ca n't currently estimate AIDS victims' average survival. `` As of November 1988, we can assist somebody to stay alive and healthy for two years, with the current therapy,'' Piers said. `` And a great deal may occur in two years. We've seen an enormous change from 1986 to 1988. `` Many people being diagnosed now may benefit from breakthroughs that will totally change the surface of the disease.''

 <PERSON> Clarisse </PERSON>, a calf with an electric heart, is one sign that political fighting over federal funding has n't stopped researchers trying to develop a permanent replacement for as many as 400 diseased hearts a year. <PERSON> Clarisse </PERSON> got her heart Dec. 8, about eight months after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> decided to suspend $ 20 million in contracts for research on a permanent artificial heart _ and six months after the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> reversed itself. Dr. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ a part of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> _ questioned in May whether more than a decade of research would lead to a permanent heart that the body would n't reject. Under pressure from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said in July that the contracts would not be suspended. The five groups funded are <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Abiomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, working with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Nimbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cordova </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, working with the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. `` Clearly, there is controversy in the medical community over whether or not the artificial heart is the right device,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said recently `` If funding is cut off now, we will never know if the artificial heart was the right answer.'' Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> have been working since the mid-1970s on electrical versions of the air-driven, or pneumatic, heart first implanted in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> dentist <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in December 1982 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. Recipients of air-driven hearts remain mostly bedridden in hospitals, linked by tubes to large compressors, unless they get human heart transplants. Recipients of the electric heart will be able to walk, exercise and even work. `` The advantage of these hearts is that you'll be able to put everything inside the patient's chest except the battery,'' said <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, assistant chief of <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s division of artifical organs. `` Nobody is ever saying that this is going to be as good as a natural heart, that this patient is going to forget he's got it and go on to live a normal life. That's not true,'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. Because the devices must meet specific requirements _ such as pumping eight liters of blood a minute _ designs are similar at all five research facilities. The Penn State device, which has the size and heft of a squared softball, has a 10-pound, rechargeable battery pack on a waist belt. A battery in the heart will let a recipient take off the external battery for up to 45 minutes. The device, designed to last about five years, probably will cost about the $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 that a heart transplant costs, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> began testing its electric models in animals in 1983. One implanted Jan. 8, 1983, in a calf named `` E.T.'' _ short for `` <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION>'' _ enabled the animal to live 222 days _ a record on any electric artificial heart. Since then, the device has grown smaller _ closer in size to a human heart _ as researchers make use of advancements in a miniaturized electronics. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said he expects human tests to begin in the late 1990s. Researchers had hoped to start the trials in the early 1990s, but scaling down the electronics proved more difficult than expected. Despite the delays in perfecting a permanent heart, there have been benefits from the research, including better knowledge of drugs to prevent heart disease or strokes, improved design on commonly used artificial heart valves, and better techniques and materials for use in cardiac bypass surgery. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said the progress that's been made against heart disease is unlikely to eliminate the need for artificial heart research. `` I do n't think anything would please the people working on the artificial heart more than to hear that something was discovered to prevent all that,'' he said. `` But I doubt that that will happen.''

 <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> wants to change the perception of sharks as prehistoric, and says the ocean-going killing machines have a complex immune system that could become an `` antibody factory'' for humans. <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> biological oceanographer, has been intrigued with sharks since an underwater encounter with a hammerhead in 1958. `` After 30 years of studying them, the most astonishing thing I've found about sharks is that they are so sophisticated. They have so many systems that are in higher animals, that if you did n't know better, you'd think that _ like the whales _ they evolved on land and went back to the sea.'' <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> studies the lemon shark, unique because it can survive while motionless in the water, making observation easier. Among the oddities he has observed are its eyes _ which differ among various sharks _ its reproductive system and its `` highly generalized but extremely powerful'' immune system. Sharks' eyes are unusual because some can close like a human's and others are covered by a transparent nictitating membrane, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said `` That's just totally unheard of in fish. Sharks have eyes more or less like a cat's, with split pupils. It certainly can not be explained.'' The reproductive system more closely resembles a mammal's than a fish's. The lemon shark takes up to 15 years to reach sexual maturity, then gives live birth to a dozen pups every other year. While fish lay thousands of eggs, the shark gives birth complete with placenta and umbilical cord. Only three of the dozen pups are likely to survive two years, which has profound implications for human treatment of sharks, which many people still see as a dangerous pest or, at best, a source of meat, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said. `` You want to exploit that resource, but you want it renewable. While a pair of salmon can lay 10,000 eggs and reproduce its entire species, sharks and whales can only have a very low number of young after a very, very long period of time.'' That means they are surprisingly fragile as a species; traps off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have virtually eliminated sharks in only a few years. That would have a disastrous effect on many other species, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said. Sharks are predators, and essential to evolution by eliminating weaker members of species. But humans might have even more reason to mourn the loss of sharks. Products from sharks' immune system have shown promise in treating diseases, he said. `` They are not only able to make antibodies, they already have antibodies to many disease that they would never see or get, such as human smallpox. Why this is I do n't know. When attacked by a disease, sharks generate huge amounts of antibodies, making them a potential factory for helping humans fight diseases like AIDS or cancer, he said. `` If we could keep a number of sharks and raise antibodies, then each person could have his own shark, his own antibody factory.'' There is evidence of cancer-fighting potential in the shark's skeleton, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said `` Researchers were actually able to isolate a protein that when injected into the tumor would cause it to dry up and die.'' Side effects make such treatment impractical for humans, but <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> is interested because he suffers from a cancer of the lymph system that causes his joints to swell. He goes regularly to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for an experimental treatment that involves injections of rat antibodies. Despite cancer and occasional accidents including a mangled hand, nearly drowning and having a shark almost tear his leg off, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said he intends to continue his underwater research. `` We owe it to the world to study something like the shark. And you ca n't do it from the top of a hill with field glasses.''

The Penn State device, which has the size and heft of a squared softball, has a 10-pound, rechargeable battery pack on a waist belt. A battery in the heart will let a recipient take off the external battery for up to 45 minutes. The device, designed to last about five years, probably will cost about the $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 that a heart transplant costs, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said.

<NOTE>Researcher Challenges Shark Theories</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> wants to change the perception of sharks as prehistoric, and says the ocean-going killing machines have a complex immune system that could become an `` antibody factory'' for humans. <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> biological oceanographer, has been intrigued with sharks since an underwater encounter with a hammerhead in 1958. `` After 30 years of studying them, the most astonishing thing I've found about sharks is that they are so sophisticated. They have so many systems that are in higher animals, that if you did n't know better, you'd think that _ like the whales _ they evolved on land and went back to the sea.'' <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> studies the lemon shark, unique because it can survive while motionless in the water, making observation easier. Among the oddities he has observed are its `` highly generalized but extremely powerful'' immune system. Products from shark immune systems have shown promise in treating diseases, including cancer, he said. `` They are not only able to make antibodies, they already have antibodies to many disease that they would never see or get, such as human smallpox.'' When attacked by a disease, sharks generate huge amounts of antibodies, making them a potential factory for helping humans fight diseases like AIDS or cancer, he said. `` If we could keep a number of sharks and raise antibodies, then each person could have his own shark, his own antibody factory.''

 Scientists looking for ways to provide food, oxygen and sewage treatment for space travelers are growing wheat in a computer-controlled capsule that mimics Earth's ecosystem The Kennedy Space Center scientists cultivated their garden by hand for about three years in the 12-by-23-foot `` biomass production chamber,'' and then turned it over in mid-November to a computer. The computer makes sure that the wheat, growing hydroponically, gets enough light, air, water and fertilizer. `` If you're truly, permanently going to space, you've got to have a system like this,'' says plant physiologist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>, head of the project. Without such a system, <PERSON> Knott </PERSON> says, astronauts would need regular shipments of fresh air, potable water and prepared food _ prohibitively expensive for any planned space habitats and impossible for voyaging spaceships. `` Sooner or later, we're going to get tired of sending TV dinners out and bringing port-a-potties back,'' said agricultural engineer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>. One problem is trying to cram enough of the important parts of the biosphere into a container small enough to fit in a spaceship, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, another agricultural engineer. `` In the physical world, if you model a dam on the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, you build everything smaller. When we model the biological process ... we ca n't build people smaller.'' A life support system in flight might carry several staple crops such as wheat, rice, beans, soy, potatoes, peanuts and lettuce, and might carry only 25 gallons of water. Astronauts would have to recycle water to stretch the supply. Another obstacle is converting sewage into a fertilizer that wo n't kill the plants, which thrive on a carefully blended chemical solution. A prototype life support system could be ready for a ground test by 1995, but it could be 2020 before a system would be available for flight testing, say <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientists.

<NOTE>Women Control Labor Pain With the Push of a Button</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Women may be only a button away from controlling the severity of their labor pains during childbirth, according to a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> researcher who studied a self-administered pain-killing technique. The technique, patient-controlled epidural analgesia, lets a woman control the amount of pain medication she gets. Patients who used it tended to use less than those who got medication from a doctor or nurse, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysak </PERSON>, who directed a study of 74 women at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to potentially limiting fetal exposure to anesthesia, the self-administered technique provides a psychological advantage by increasing patient participation in the labor process, researchers said. `` Using this technique, women safely and effectively treated their own pain throughout the course of labor,'' said <PERSON> Lysak </PERSON>, who presented his findings last year at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anesthesiologists </ORGANIZATION>. Patients who use the technique push a button to administer a measured dose of a pain-relieving medication. A thin tube inserted near the patient's spinal cord in the lower back carries medication to nerves and receptors. The device has a timer to prevent a patient from overdosing herself.

 A biomedical engineer and an anesthesiologist are working on a high-tech version of the stethoscope, with three sound pickups instead of the single amplifier doctors use to chill their patients. The multichannel electronic stethoscope designed by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> improves the doctor's ability to hear and monitor the supply of oxygen to a patient's lungs during surgery, and lets the anesthesiologist hear the heart and changes in breathing sounds from each lung.

It can help determine if an oxygen tube has shifted or is inserted incorrectly, or if a lung has collapsed, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, an anesthesiologist at <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` By using the multichannel stethoscope and comparing the sounds, you can recognize problems that much faster. `` You can localize even a slight wheeze by turning up the volume and come up with a good diagnosis.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, have applied for a patent for their version of the device first invented in 1819 by <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Laennec </PERSON>, a French physician.

<HEAD>Tips To Prevent Ear Discomfort During Airline Travel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Do your ears hurt when your jetliner starts descending for a landing? Here are some tips from the nation's ear, nose and throat doctors to relieve the discomfort: _ Pop your ears to equalize the pressure Pinch your nostrils, take in a mouthful of air and, with your mouth closed, use your cheek and throat muscles to force the air into the back of your nose `` as if you were trying to blow your fingers off your nose. When you feel a pop in your ears, you may have succeeded,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Otolaryngology </ORGANIZATION> and Head and Neck Surgery. If necessary, repeat the procedure several times, but stop if it hurts. _ Try swallowing and yawning to activate the muscle that opens the Eustachian tube connecting the back of the throat with the middle ear Chewing gum or letting mints melt in your mouth will help you swallow more often. _ Avoid sleeping during descent You may not swallow enough to keep up with pressure changes if you are asleep. _ If you have allergies, take antihistamines at the start of the flight or a decongestent pill or nose spray an hour or so before descent <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON> said the medications will help your ears pop more easily, but they should n't be used by people with heart disease, high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, thyroid disease or excessive nervousness. If your ears fail to open or pain persists after landing, you may need to consult your ear doctor, he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Gains In December, Survey Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers' confidence about the state of the economy increased in December, boosted by low inflation, low unemployment and growth in personal income, a business-financed research organization reported. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 119.8, up nearly 7 points from November, the board said in a report for release Tuesday. The index had declined in November to 113.1 from October's figure of 116.9. People interviewed for the survey were particularly positive about the current economic situation, the board said, with this component of the confidence index reaching its highest point since the boom years of the late 1960s. The monthly survey of 5,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households is conducted for the board by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` The consumer's very favorable assessment of prevailing conditions reflects the continued vigor of the economy and bodes well for the immediate future,'' said <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, executive director of the board's <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unemployment is at its lowest level in many years, personal income continues to grow, and the inflation rate is virtually imperceptible to the average shopper,'' he said in a statement. `` All these factors contribute to a high level of confidence. `` Still, there is some uncertainty about the future, with the policies of the new administration on such major issues as the federal budget and the foreign trade deficits still unknown,'' he added. Buying plans among those surveyed remained at roughly the same level for the past few months, the board said. About 7 percent of respondents said they plan to purchase a car within six months, 3.5 percent intend to buy a home in the period, and nearly 29 percent plan to buy a major appliance.

<HEAD>Japan Struggles With Influx of Illegal Foreign Laborers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wealth of job opportunities is luring tens of thousands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asians </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, forcing this once isolated nation to cope with the problem of migrant labor. More than half the foreigners working at companies investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> between Oct. 16 and Nov. 16 were found to be working illegally, a recent report showed. Poor working conditions and the risk of deportation have n't discouraged the wave of workers from less wealthy Asian nations, nor have wages that are low by Japanese standards although, because of the strong yen, high in the foreign workers' own countries The Japanese government, so far, has responded to the surge in foreign labor with plans to open its doors wider to foreign professionals. But it has reaffirmed a ban on manual laborers, provoking a national debate over the merits of internationalizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s closed society. While government and private groups study the problem, the influx of illegal foreign workers continues to grow. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> deported 11,307 foreigners for working illegally. In the first half of this year, Japanese police and immigration authorities arrested 7,196 foreigners for working illegally, up from 5,802 in the first half of 1987. But those numbers compare with police estimates that about 70,000 illegal foreign workers are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. About half the illegal workers are men. Women, often recruited by crime syndicates, long have flocked to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to work, often legally, as `` entertainers.'' Human rights groups say the gangs that control <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s underworld often force them into working as prostitutes. Since 1985, however, the number of illegal male workers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has ballooned as unskilled workers from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> find ready employment, Labor Ministry figures show. In the ministry's investigation, of 202 foreigners working at 15,796 companies, 111 were working illegally, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said 54 of the illegal workers were from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, 36 from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, 13 from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, two each from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and one each from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Most of the clandestine laborers worked long hours with no vacations for low wages, having overstayed tourist visas after finding work at construction sites or in small metal working, chemical or food processing factories, the report said. Despite the government ban, firms that hire foreign manual workers are not penalized. A shortage of Japanese willing to do manual labor encourages them to employ foreigners, who often are reluctant to complain of poor treatment due to the risk of deportation, said <PERSON> Eiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinotsuka </PERSON>, a labor economist at <ORGANIZATION> Ochanomizu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Both men and women working illegally are vulnerable to exploitation because of their illegal status, said <PERSON> Yaeko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeoka </PERSON>, a lawyer familiar with the problems of clandestine workers. Japanese employees in the metal working industry receive average hourly wages of 2,150 yen, or about $ 17.20. Clandestine workers receive hourly wages of 500 to 700 yen, or $ 4 to $ 5.60, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures show. But a few months of even low wages in Japanese yen amount to a fortune for migrant workers due to the lower cost of living in other Asian countries. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s average per capita income is about $ 17,000, compared with $ 550 in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, $ 113 in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and $ 360 in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. By living together in small apartments to save on expenses, the clandestine workers manage to send about half their wages home to their families. Isolated in a society where they must constantly hide from police and immigration officials, few plan to stay in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> indefinitely. `` They just come for short stays,'' <PERSON> Shinotsuka </PERSON> said. Economists say the influx of illegal laborers is unlikely to abate because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 2.4 percent unemployment rate reflects a trend toward shortages of workers in certain industries. A recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> of an Economic Structure of the 21st Century predicted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will face a shortage of 2.7 million workers by the year 2000 if current economic trends continue. The council recommended that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accept unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers and suggested establishment of a system to prevent exploitation of `` guest workers.'' Numerous commentaries also have urged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> welcome its less affluent neighbors. `` In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, we do n't accept political asylum and we turn our backs on immigrants. Maybe, in the short run, this is a wise policy in avoiding problems. However, can we say this policy is right over the long run?'' wrote commentator <PERSON> Yunosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohkura </PERSON> in The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Times. Noting that Japanese believe they are `` unique and therefore superior,'' <PERSON> Mitsunobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugiyama </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent article in the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Quarterly that `` constant contact with the people of other nations on this very personal level would do much to open Japanese eyes and help them better understand the rest of the world.'' A recent report by a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel, however, concluded that foreign manual laborers were undesirable. Their unfamiliarity with Japanese language and customs, it said, could cause social conflict.

<HEAD>Carrier Begins Year With Mediation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, smaller and deeper in debt than a year ago, begins 1989 facing federal mediation considered crucial to what the carrier will look like a year from now _ if it still exists. `` We simply can not survive if the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> persists in holding <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> hostage as it has been doing,'' wrote <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for human resources, in a Dec. 28 letter to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, chairman of the mediation board. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> will participate in Jan. 6 mediation at an undisclosed location between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its Machinists union. The mediation sessions, with no deadline set by the federal board, are aimed at settling a 16-month-old contract dispute that has been before the board for a year. Failure to reach agreement could lead to the mediation board's declaration of an impasse That would trigger a 30-day cooling-off period, after which the union could strike and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could impose its own work conditions. While some union leaders suspect the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ownership would like a strike so that it could try to break the strike and bust the union, the struggling airline might not last through disruptions and much more negative publicity. Eastern ended the year with new public questions about its safety after an emergency landing Dec. 26 in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> of an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight with a hole in its fuselage There were no injuries and company officials say <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has one of the industry's best safety records. But the incident came after Eastern earlier in the year went through a comprehensive <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> probe and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny. Those studies said Eastern was safe, but its unusually bad labor-management relations could threaten safety. Executives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union will meet early this month to discuss their contract talks, begun about six months ago, with management. The pilots are also hopeful the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has set final briefs for early February, will agree with them that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> sister, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, are being run as a single carrier. A single-carrier ruling could lead to unionization of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, to which <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has transferred some <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets because of its non-union status, the pilots union says. Eastern officials say <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is run separately from Eastern. The pilots have n't said whether they would honor a Machinists strike. Since Machinists negotiations began, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has laid off 7,233 employees, or about a fifth of its workforce, and lost $ 319 million, the company says. It has been lobbying ardently for declaration of an impasse, bringing the 30-day deadline the company says will force movement in the negotiations. Eastern reported $ 233.7 million in losses for the first three quarters of 1988, and its loss for the past decade totals $ 1.3 billion. Management and its largest union, the 8,500-worker Machinists, are $ 200 million apart in their latest contract offers. But besides money, there are important philosophical differences between the two sides. Machinists District 100 President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> firmly believes workers should have a major role in company decision-making. His dream has been an employee-owned Eastern. The management of Eastern, bought nearly three years ago by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, has been more interested in slashing the wages of the non-mechanics in the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. Mechanics comprise about half the union, but the management says it must cut baggage handler and other non-mechanic wages. Some baggage handlers, for example, woud have hourly wages cut over three years from $ 15.60 to $ 10. Mechanics, who comprise about half the union, would be cut only by small amounts. Union officials have described the company offer as a divide-and-conquer strategy to split the union between mechanics and the other workers. Eastern management also points out that <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> refused to take the 20 percent salary cuts agreed to by its pilots and flight attendants unions in February 1986 in an effort to stave off bankruptcy or the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Machinists leaders say <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees are being told to suffer even more for bad management that is n't committed to keeping Eastern alive. The unions say <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is stripping away <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets and will abandon a carcass. The $ 365 million sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle service to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and the earlier spinoff of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s computer reservations system to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> are cited to support that argument. Planes and gates have also been sold, and Eastern reportedly has been offering other assets such as Canadian routes. Eastern says it needs cash infusions to keep operating. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who portrays his union's resistance to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as a virtual holy war, has sought a `` white knight'' to rescue Eastern employees and allow them to take over the airline. But the only reported serious talks last year about buying Eastern were with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who wanted steep union concessions. In a Nov. 9 letter to <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who had n't deigned to communicate directly with <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> until recent months, said the contract negotiations were the most realistic way to help the airline. `` Time is running against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wrote.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say Year Closed With Strong Economic Growth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's economy closed 1988 with vigorous growth, with December posting the biggest increase in the rates of production and new orders for goods since July, according to a survey of corporate purchasing executives released Tuesday. `` December exited like a lion,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s Business Survey Committee. `` The continued robust growth capped the final quarter at what could be the strongest growth rate of the year. `` Except for a solid downtrend in the rate of inflation, there were few signs of the anticipated slowing in this, the seventh year of the recovery,'' added <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, who is director of materials management at <ORGANIZATION> Pitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The group's Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 58.1 percent in December, compared with 56.6 percent in November. The December figure was the highest since July's 59 percent. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the economy is generally expanding; below 50, that it is generally declining. The group's seasonally adjusted production index advanced to 61.3 percent, compared with 58.2 percent in November. It was the highest since July's 62.7 percent, according to the monthly survey of purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies. The index of new orders rose to 60.1 percent, up from 58 percent in November, and the highest since 62.1 percent in July. The employment growth rate index slowed only slightly in December to 57.5 percent. Except for November's 57.9 percent, it was at its highest level since December 1987. New export orders increased at the highest rate since July after growing at a slower rate for the four previous months, the survey found. Of those members of the trade group who export, 30 percent reported higher export orders, up from 22 percent in November. The 6 percent who indicated lower export orders was down from 8 percent in November. Vendor deliveries, which indicate whether companies are receiving orders faster than they can deliver them, contined to slow in December, to 54 percent compared with November's 52.1 percent, reflecting the seasonally strong growth in production, the association said. Inventories also increased, but at a lesser rate than in November. The seasonally adjusted inventory index was 51.4 percent in December, compared with November's 52.6 percent. This suggests that some modest inventory buildup may have occurred to hedge against announced Jan. 1 price increases and to alleviate shortages in some commodities, the group said. The growth rate in prices was lower for the sixth consecutive month and was at its lowest level since May 1987, the survey found, confirming a solid decline in inflation since midyear. In another survey last month, a majority of the group's members said they believed the economy would do better this year than in 1988, with continued growth and slower inflation.

Packers are lace-up cowboy boots that offer pointed toes and tall heels to fit a stirrup while riding a horse and ankle support while walking on the ground. With <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> cutting out the leather pieces, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> sewing them together, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> forming the uppers over the last and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> finishing them off with soles, the <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> family turns out three pairs of boots a day. Although <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> sells through a few retail outlets in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and have filled an order that came out of the blue from <LOCATION> Horsehead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, they are a small outfit and like it that way. `` We're small enough that we do n't have people coming in and telling us what we can and ca n't do,'' says <PERSON> Anita </PERSON>. `` The caulked boot business is such a limited market that the Japanese and the other countries are not interested,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>. `` If you were talking dress loafers, we could n't compete.'' The $ 225 they charge for a pair of standard-sized caulked boots is competitive with mass-produced boots. It's $ 50 extra for a custom fit. The <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> family once tried to boost production by hiring some help, but it did n't work out. `` People do n't care the way we care,'' <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> said. `` They're used to getting mill wages and we could n't pay it.'' Disdaining cardboard, they put steel shanks and stiff nylon heel counters in the caulked boots to make them more rugged. The foot part of the boot is sewn on with the smooth skin side of the leather on the inside to make them tougher still. `` If the skin side is out you can cut that on a rock the first day and it wo n't hold grease,'' to keep the water out, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> said. They rely on satisfied customers to get the word out. `` We've only advertised two times,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> said Packers with red tops and black bottoms were all the rage for awhile among working cowboys. `` The buckeroos do n't make much money, but what little they do make they put into their gear,'' says <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>. `` You ride the range all day and a good-looking boot can be something to talk about.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which has a foreign debt of about $ 33 billion, will initiate a new round of refinancing talks with its <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> within two weeks, the government said. Finance Minister <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> and Finance Vice-Minister <PERSON> Eglee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iturbe </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> notified advisory committee chairman <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that a negotiating team will arrive in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` in the first half of January.'' <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>'s message was sent Dec. 31 and published in local newspapers Monday. President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> announced the reopening of talks on much of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s $ 33 billion debt in his annual New Year's address. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fourth largest debtor. <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> also declared a moratorium on principal payments of foreign commercial bank debt, most of which is included in a $ 20.34 billion refinancing pact signed in 1986 and modified in 1987. The moratorium, which begins Jan. 17, initially affects some $ 700 million due during 1989 under the existing pact, plus some commercial bank debt not included in the pact. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has already paid nearly $ 1.5 billion in principal refinanced in the $ 20.34 billion agreement. The moratorium does not include principal payment of debts to multilateral or official financial institutions, foreign currency-denominated public bonds, trade credits or loans acquired after 1983, <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> said in the message to the banks. Interest payments are also not affected. Talks are likely to be concluded during the administration of President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> advisers say they want to stretch the current 14-year refinancing pact to 25 years and reduce net yearly debt payments to no more than $ 1.5 billion. Perez plans to travel Tuesday to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for informal talks on the foreign debt and other regional issues with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' office said Monday. The Venezuelan president-elect is promoting a common Latin American framework for debt talks which would link debt to trade and reduce payments. In 1988, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> paid about $ 5 billion in public and private debt service, or half of its total estimated foreign exchange income of $ 10.1 billion.

<HEAD>Iraq Cuts Exports To Comply With OPEC Quota, Saudi King Issues Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has cut oil exports by 90,000 barrels a day in accordance with its new <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quota of 2.64 million barrels a day, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said that as of Jan. 1 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had stopped trucking 65,000 barrels a day to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> and another 25,000 barrels a day through <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Monday launched a multi-billion deficit budget for fiscal 1989 with a warning that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> would not be bound by OPEC-fixed oil production quotas if others violated them. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> currently exports 1.5 million barrels a day through a pipeline across <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> ports, and another 500,000 barrels a day through a pipeline across <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION>, the agency said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s quota, matching that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was set by the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at a cartel meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in November. Previously <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had a cap of 2.4 million barrels a day, compared to 1.5 million barrels a day for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which was heavily exceeding its quota. The former gulf war enemies badly need increased oil revenues in order to rebuild economies shattered by 8 years of hostilities. In <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said budget outlays for the world's biggest oil-exporting nation were approved at a weekly cabinet session chaired by King Fahd. Expenditures were set at 141 million riyals, or about $ 37.6 billion, against projected revenues of 116 billion riyals, or $ 30.9 billion. That left a deficit of 25 billion riyals, or $ 6.7 billion, down from 35.9 billion riyals for 1988, to be covered by public borrowing, the agency said. Budget deficits have become a chronic problem in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other oil-producing nations since crude prices started slipping in the early 1980s because of a world glut. The new restrictive <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota system took effect on Sunday in a fresh attempt to remedy the situation. King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> stressed the importance of `` discipline and adherence'' to the quotas if prices are to improve. He warned that although <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is `` the first state to abide by what <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agrees to ... I do n't think that anyone can blame the kingdom if the contract is broken.'' `` We do not want to see that to happen under any circumstances and it is hoped that the losses suffered by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> states give an idea of what can result from a chaos, as happened a few years ago and again a year ago,'' he added.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday they had begun their previously-disclosed joint venture to refine and market petroleum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>A Glimmer of Optimism From the Nation's Economists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Economists will tell you they make their prognostications on the basis of `` the data,'' not gut feelings about the economy. But some attending last week's conference here of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> were bold enough to venture guesses on the fate of the economy without their usual battery of numbers at hand. Yes, there were scores of seminars during the conference on such esoteric topics as `` Empirical Analysis of Price Determinants'' -LRB- and we wonder why <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> ca n't understand simple rules of economics -RRB-. But there was also a fair amount of cocktail and luncheon chatter about what economists might call `` exogenous'' _ or outside _ factors affecting the ebb and flow of the economy. Principal among them, politics _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s politics, to be more precise. Theories about how the president-elect will manage the economy span the usual spectrum, as you might expect. Yet a predominantly hopeful theory is emerging in some quarters, based on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition performance While some pundits have criticized his recently announced Cabinet selections as bland, others are impressed by the mix of key holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and new choices aimed at mending fences with old opponents. So far, these optimists say, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done several things right. When the markets reacted negatively in the days following his election, he moved swiftly to name his `` economic team,'' long before settling on advisers for defense and other areas. Among his earliest choices was <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to remain as treasury secretary, a pick that was applauded by those who admired <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s work as head of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> committee investigating the October 1987 stock market crash. Having <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a former treasury secretary and an architect of past accords to stabilize the dollar in world markets, as secretary of state also was seen as a plus by some economic experts. Later additions that have drawn praise are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to chief economic adviser, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to agriculture secretary, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to commerce secretary and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> move was viewed as especially significant since it not only installed an experienced hand at the wheel of labor, but also helped smooth the ruffled feathers of the secretary-designate's husband, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>. Other rough spots in the road that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly patched were in He initiated a meeting with his defeated challenger, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and also offered to make ex-House Speaker <PERSON> Tip </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> the next ambassador to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Neither of the high-profile Democrats will end up serving the new administration, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s thoughtful gestures were n't lost on the loyal opposition The optimists say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s style may help him make strides on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where Democratic cooperation will be crucial to keeping his pledge of no new taxes. One economist at last week's conference, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said he predicts a great `` Rose Garden compromise'' along about April that will put a two-year federal budget in place, restrain the deficit and maybe even avoid new taxes. That certainly would provide the so-called `` soft landing'' the economy needs to avert recession in 1989. Non-believers would say such fine-tuning went out a long time ago, about the time <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> used sky-high interest rates to squelch inflation. Still, the prospect of striking a delicate balance in economic policy, between bust and boom, is intriguing _ particularly now, a few weeks before the inauguration when hope springs eternal.
