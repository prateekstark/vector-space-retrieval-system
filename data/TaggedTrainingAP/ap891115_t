 Early unofficial returns Wednesday night showed conservative <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> leading <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first free and direct presidential election since 1960 With about 8 percent of the votes counted, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, who led most exit polls with 30 percent, had 2,225,909 votes, followed by left-wing populist <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> with 1,628,735 votes, said <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest network. Late Wednesday the government announced a 12-hour delay in the official count, reportedly because of computer problems. In third place was <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> of the Marxist-oriented Workers' Party with 1,561,739 votes, trailed by Sen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Covas </PERSON> of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 1,345,248 votes but with surprising leads in two of the country's largest cities, the network said. <PERSON> Covas </PERSON>, a dark-horse candidate, held a strong lead in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the nation's most populous city, and was a solid second in <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Horizonte </PERSON>, the TV network said. The network said some 130,000 people voted for popular TV game-show host <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, who tried to enter the race two weeks before the election but whose candidacy was thrown out by the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. More than 82 million people were eligible to vote for a successor to President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who was chosen by an electoral college when the generals relinquished power in 1985 after two decades' rule. Voting was mandatory for Brazilians aged 18-69. The chief of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s federal police, <PERSON> Romeu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuma </PERSON>, said there were `` no significant incidents to mar the voting. We are very pleased with how calm the day was.'' Final results are not expected until Saturday and, on the assumption no one gains a majority, a runoff between the two leaders is planned for Dec. 17. The first official results announced were from a relative handful of Brazilians who cast ballots in embassies and consulates in 19 countries, with Collor de Mello leading followed by <PERSON> Covas </PERSON> and <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, a 40-year-old former state governor, has been a harsh critic of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. Leading in the polls since April, his dapper good looks and anti-corruption platform made Collor de Mello popular with the poor, a majority in the Brazilian electorate. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> is widely blamed for official corruption and an annual inflation rate of at least 1,300 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> first announced results would start being released at 8:00 p.m. local time, just three hours after the polls closed. However, that time was pushed back to 11:00 p.m. and then to Thursday. An election official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told a reporter there was a problem with computer links between <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> and far-off voting precincts. Parties ranged from the Communists to one formerly backed by the military entered candidates. Fully 73 percent of the Brazilian electorate had never voted for president. Lines lines of voters began forming before dawn, hours before polls opened at 8 a.m., from the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle in the north to the southern pampas. The results showed the candidates leading in their regional strongholds _ <ORGANIZATION> Collor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mello </ORGANIZATION> led in the federal capital of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, in northeastern <LOCATION> Maceio </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, an ex-labor leader, held wide leads in southeastern <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Horizonte </PERSON> and the two northeastern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal cities of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led in the southern capital cities of <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alegre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s second-largest city Promotional spots on nationwide television said that whereas in 1960 it took three months to count the votes, this year, with modern computer technology, the results would be announced as quickly as possible. The federal electoral court promised results by 8 p.m. but that was postponed several times for reasons not explained. Election officials directed that ballots cast at the 250,000 voting stations in the nation's 4,445 counties be flown to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> after local counting. Several candidates raised the possibility of fraud. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> responded on Wednesday: `` Many candidates are setting up parallel vote-counting, for fear of fraud, but fraud is impossibe and there is no ` virus' or ` microbe' that can affect our computers.'' Collor de Mello voted early in <LOCATION> Maceio </LOCATION> and flew back to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> to follow the count for president, who will serve five years and can not seek re-election. The election took place on a national holiday, the 100th anniversary of the republic that ended the reign of Emperor <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> II. In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, many <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> sympathizers wore red bandannas, the candidate's trademark. In <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, election officials delayed voting for two hours and ordered the bandannas removed. The penalty for not voting is a fine of up to 20 new cruzados, about $ 3.30. A 1988 constitutional reform also enfranchised citizens aged 16 and 17, but voting is not compulsory for them. Liquor sales were forbidden from midnight Tuesday to 6 a.m. Thursday. <PERSON> Janio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadros </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s last free and direct presidential election, in 1960. He resigned after seven months and the ensuing confusion led to a military coup in 1964. The army canceled direct presidential elections, although they permitted some regional elections. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, 59, said this election `` concludes the transition to democracy.'' `` There has never been so much freedom in the country,'' he said Tuesday night. `` In homes, at work, in the streets, opinions are divided and no one is afraid, because we know democracy exists.'' He did not publicly support any candidate, and described his role in the election as a `` magistrate.''

 Peace talks between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels fell into disarray Wednesday night with the two sides offering sharply differing assessments on the progress of the negotiations. The Contra delegation stunned the Sandinista negotiators in early evening by asking for a week-long recess just when, Sandinista officials said, an agreement seemed within reach. The chief Nicaraguan government negotiator, Vice-Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, described the Contra proposal as `` a total surprise'' because he said the two sides had made `` a lot of progress'' earlier in the day. The talks took a bizarre twist when, according to <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> delegation disappeared at 8 p.m. after members said they wanted to talk among themselves. `` We do n't know where they are,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters shortly after 10 p.m. `` They are somewhere in this building.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> and other members of the Sandinista delegation then returned to their hotel. An hour later, the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> delegation reappeared and told reporters they planned to return late Thursday morning to discuss with the Sandinistas the timing for the resumption of the negotiations. They left the impression that they might rescind their earlier request for a seven-day recess. Earlier, rebel spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> disagreed strongly when he was informed that an American member of the Sandinista delegation, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, had given an upbeat account of the discussions. `` Unfortunately there was not any flexibility on the part of the government to reach a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. Informed that <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON> had said that the two sides were on the verge of an agreement, <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> replied, `` I would say Mr. <PERSON> Rickler </PERSON>'s perception is not accurate.'' Still earlier, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said his government offered a major concession in cease-fire talks with the Contras by dropping its demand that the rebels demobilize. As its price for restoring the cease-fire the government allowed to lapse Nov. 1, <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the government is insisting only that Contra forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> return to their base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We think that is a very important change in our position,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told a news conference at the Nicaraguan Embassy a few hours before the peace talks reconvened at the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> maintained that while the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are willing to make concessions, the Contras have shown `` not an inch of flexibility'' in four rounds of talks starting last Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. There was no immediate response by the rebels but administration officials said the Contras have told them evacuation from Nicaraguan territory is not feasible. As part of a cease-fire agreement, the rebels would be willing instead to relocate in designated `` enclaves'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> where their activities could easily be monitored by international observers, the Contras have told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. If they return to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, it is possible they could be prevented by international monitors from returning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the Contras have argued. In addition, they said, since the Contras are Nicaraguans, it makes more sense for them to remain inside their own homeland rather than in a neighboring country. There are an estimated 5,000 rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, about 2,000 of whom have infiltrated from the Honduran base camps in recent weeks. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declined to renew the cease fire on Nov. 1, drawing widespread international condemnation. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Monday that the suspension of the truce had created `` a militarized election atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> defended his decision by saying the rebels had been engaging in terrorist activity. While allowing the truce to lapse after 19 months, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> simultaneously called for a resumption of discussions with the resistance. Hoping to prod the negotiators toward a settlement were representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They are members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up to oversee the peace process.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s president Wednesday to express solidarity with the rightist government in the face of a fierce guerrilla attack that has left upwards of 500 people dead and more than 1,000 wounded. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commended President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> for the efforts of the Salvadoran armed forces `` to avoid causing casualties to the civilian population.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also pledged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to speak out about <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Nicaraguan support for the guerrillas, `` which flies in the face'' of regional peace accords. The four-day-guerrilla offensive appeared stalled as government troops drove the rebels from working-class neighborhoods in fierce combat. The armed forces' air power and numerical superiority combined with lack of popular support for the guerrillas appeared to tilt the battle for the capital in favor of the government. In Friday editions, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were accelerating deliveries of munitions and other aid scheduled for delivery to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> he stands behind the Salvadoran government. `` The president said that the -LRB- rebel force -RRB- bears full responsibility for this tragedy and that he wanted to express the solidarity of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for the great suffering in <LOCATION> Sal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and elsewhere.'' The press spokesman said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his support and reported that the armed forces were having increasing success against the guerrillas. Further, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the government `` would continue to give the highest priority to protecting the civilian population in military operations against those guerrillas that remained,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 The nation's oldest air passenger service, whose seaplanes carried celebrities, outlaws and at least one fleeing dictator in its 70 years, may be grounded by financial losses and competition from modern jets. Unless a buyer is found, the final island-hopping Chalk's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' flight will splash down Dec. 15 on <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> `` It's a very sad moment. This is an item of living history that may bite the dust,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifas </PERSON>, an attorney for financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has owned Chalk's since 1974. `` It was an exciting, thrilling way to move people,'' said <PERSON> Rifas </PERSON>. `` It's really a depressing thing for me to handle this.'' <PERSON> Rifas </PERSON> said losses have been `` very, very substantial'' at Chalk's, whose 17-seat seaplanes were featured on the opening credits of the former hit series `` Miami Vice.'' Resorts reported losses of $ 2.3 million for the first half of 1989 for its airline operations, including Chalk's and <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which carries travelers to Resorts' Bahamian casino complex. Chalk's dropped its <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> route last month and now operates three daily flights between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION>. Resorts itself is struggling with mounting debt and falling values of junk bonds used by <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to finance acquisition of the company from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> last year. The possible demise of Chalk's would end a direct link with <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s flamboyant past as a mecca for such pioneer aviators as <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickenbaker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Curtiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>. In 1919, barnstormer and stunt pilot <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> `` Pappy'' Chalk took a Curtiss F flying boat to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and tied up along the bayfront, where he pitched an umbrella and began offering $ 5 sightseeing flights. During the next decades, Chalk's <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island flights carried everyone from sunburned tourists to shady Prohibition-era rumrunners. Passenger manifests also included names such as <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. In 1933, a hail of bullets followed a Chalk's plane whisking deposed <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Machado </PERSON> into exile. In 1972, a Chalk's crewman and pilot were wounded by two gunmen who commandeered an aircraft to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The crew and passengers returned to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> the next day. Five years later, 88-year-old Chalk died after falling from a tree he was trimming. The only accident involving a Chalk's aircraft and resulting in an injury occurred in 1985, when a <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mallard </ORGANIZATION> crashed after takeoff from Cat Cay south of <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION>. One the 12 passengers was injured. `` When you talk about amphibious aircraft you are going back to the origins of international air travel,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's really a look back to the beginnings. The museum is exhibiting a former Chalk's Grumman Goose, the forerunner of the Mallards now operated by the airline. Ms. <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> said 63-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, is officially the nation's oldest passenger `` airline,'' a designation that requires posted schedules and a federal license. But she said Chalk's, which received airline status in the 1940s after years without firm, posted schedules, may lay claim to being the oldest passenger `` service'' and the last surviving scheduled seaplane operation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Catalina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boats </ORGANIZATION> discontinued seaplane service last year from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Like other seaplane services, Chalk's has been unable to compete with faster and larger jets. Several airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, have service to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> now uses 50-seat Dash 7 planes to its private airstrip. Resorts reported it lost $ 48.5 million for the first six months of 1989 on revenue of $ 223.7 million.

 A `` little half-pint'' size waitress pregnant with twins chased and helped catch a man who police say stabbed one of her regular customers at the restaurant. `` I did n't know what I was going to do if I caught him,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, who is 4 -LCB- months pregnant and just shy of 5 feet tall. She did n't have to worry because her screams during Tuesday afternoon's four-block chase alerted a police officer, who caught the man. The 49-year-old suspect, a drifter from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, was being held pending a charge of aggravated robbery, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelmann </PERSON>, a St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> police spokesman. The victim, 86-year-old <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who was in fair condition Tuesday night following surgery at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, identified the man as his attacker, said police and hospital officials. Young stumbled out of a restroom at Tin Cup's Place in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> after he was attacked. `` He kind of fell into my arms and said he had been stabbed and mugged,'' said a cook, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON>, 45. Ms. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> asked which way the attacker had gone. `` That's when she took off, the little half pint and her twins,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON>, who added she did n't have time to stop Ms. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>. `` It was just an instant reaction to get this guy,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, 24. She said when she spotted the man outside, he was walking casually, until she started screaming at him. A restaurant patron joined her in the chase but he could n't keep up, she said. She said once police caught the suspect, `` I looked at him in the car and said I hope you did n't kill this guy. He just glared at me. He never said anything to me. He did n't have a chance. I was screaming the whole time.'' She returned to the restaurant in time to tell Young the suspect was in custody and help <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s wife into the ambulance to join him. After that, she went back to waiting tables. `` That's <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>. It's like the show must go on,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Penthouse Accuses Religious Group of Extortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Penthouse magazine sued a religious organization in federal court Tuesday, accusing the group of using extortion and racketeering to suppress the sale of adult magazines. The lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> names the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It seeks to recover at least $ 25,000 the magazine claims it lost when a grocery store chain stopped selling Penthouse, according to a statement from Penthouse International. A similar lawsuit was filed against the association two weeks ago by retailing and publishing companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine and the Waldenbooks book store chain. `` These people represent the worst possible element in a free society,'' Penthouse publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> said in the statement. `` They will not rest until the public, through its inaction, allows them to regulate and approve our reading, viewing, listening and other educational and entertainment activities.'' A call late Tuesday to the group's state headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> seeking comment was not immediately returned. A home phone number for the group's state director, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Caton </PERSON>, was unlisted. The lawsuit accuses the association and <PERSON> Caton </PERSON> of distributing a letter in September to store chains `` threatening them with legal action and public ridicule unless they agreed to stop selling the magazines,'' the statement said. The letter claimed the stores were violating <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s obscenity statute and promised to name those stores as violators and demand enforcement. The publishing companies have said the statute applies only to publishers. The association acknowledged in a news release that was included in the earlier lawsuit that the pornography statute applies only to publishing companies. The association has campaigned for years against the sale of magazines such as Penthouse and Playboy. The association, which has also backed boycotts of TV programs it considers offensive, most recently persuaded Matchbox to cancel sale of a <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> doll, based on the ghoulish killer in `` Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies.

 Senior editors at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state news agency used to dread the daily phone call from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, telling them what to write. Such calls are just a memory now. `` Nobody tells us what to report and what not to report anymore,'' said <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, assistant director general of the <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` It's as if someone had removed the brakes on us.'' <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, 59, and others said Tuesday that decades of restrictions on reporting have been lifted over the last three weeks in the course of radical changes that toppled the hard-line leadership of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and culminated in the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> says he sees ADN evolving from a mouthpiece of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into a non-partisan news service `` that is there for all readers, for all parties, for all newspapers.'' Acting Chief Editor <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppe </PERSON> of the daily <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> also perceives the news media moving toward `` a real pluralism of opinions and parties,'' after shaking off constraints that resulted in some of the world's most slanted and boring reporting. His paper is run by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> _ one of four parties allowed to survive after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> assumed sole control in 1949 in exchange for acknowledging Communist supremacy. For decades, that tradeoff was reflected in <LOCATION> Neue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION>'s reporting With the exception of sports on the last page, the eight-page edition on Oct. 9 was devoted to celebrations of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary and the visit of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A headline from that edition: `` The Idea of Socialism Becomes More Enriched and is Conducive to Joint Action.'' Since then, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s peaceful revolution has swept <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION>'s pages clean of such subservience. `` The Issue is True Pluralism, of Letting the People Decide,'' read one front-page headline. `` Ninety-Three Percent -LRB- of Respondents -RRB- Want a New Election Law,'' read another. An editorial criticized the Communists in a way that would have been unthinkable just three weeks ago, urging `` those who are guilty to be made accountable to the people.'' `` It is just that party leaders and ministers are made accountable to us,'' the editorial continued. `` It is just when property and privileges gained illegally are confiscated. One should be made to take responsibility for political mistakes. And crimes have to be punished.'' State television also is n't what it used to be. Over the past three weeks: _ Chief editor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schickhelm </PERSON> of the main news program went on the air to apologize to the public for biased and false reporting and pledged `` quick and honest'' news presentation _ `` The <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION>,'' a rabidly anti-West propaganda program that enraged East Germans for nearly 30 years, was abruptly canceled. _ A <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session was transmitted live for the first time, giving viewers a chance to see suddenly enlivened legislators call for free elections and criticize the Communist leadership Such changes are appreciated by East Germans, many of whom used to watch West German television to get a feel of what was happening in their country and the world. `` I never used to watch the <PERSON> Aktuelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamera </PERSON>,'' taxi driver <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schimansky </PERSON> said of the main evening news show. `` But now, I watch it all the time, because I find it keeps me better informed about what is happening here than West German TV does.'' The new-found boldness in reporting also has made reading the newspaper more rewarding. `` I used to be through the newspaper in five minutes,'' said the 46-year-old Schimansky, as he dropped off a passenger near the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point to the West. `` Now, I need about two hours.''

<TEXT>
 In the grimy birthplace of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s peaceful revolution, the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> was a bittersweet victory for the opposition. `` We're really afraid of a sellout to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocquel </PERSON>, a leader of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s branch of New Forum, the biggest opposition group. `` This opening of the border came too quickly, it was chaotic,'' <PERSON> Hocquel </PERSON> said. `` We see a real danger that the big firms move in here and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> becomes the poorhouse of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Our people will go and work illegally in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for six months to get hard currency, then come back. We have no interest in being bought out by big business.'' <PERSON> Hocquel </PERSON>'s ideals strike a chord among many in this polluted industrial center, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s second-largest city and the throbbing heart of its astounding popular revolt. Many East Germans are proud of what they have achieved in 40 years of communism and are uneasy at the thought of being taken over by their rich brothers in the West. In recent weeks, they have been strongly politicized, but `` they are nonetheless susceptible to Western wealth. This economically strong nation is our great danger,'' <PERSON> Hocquel </PERSON> said. The opposition thus counted it a victory that, after a weekend in which 3 million East Germans went West _ many for the first time in 28 years, at least 200,000 marched in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> Monday night to demand free elections and shout anti-Communist slogans. But the real test of popular belief in New Forum as a political movement will come Saturday, when the group is host to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s first legal opposition assembly on <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s market square. `` Before the opening of the borders, I would have said half a million people would come,'' <PERSON> Hocquel </PERSON> said. `` Now, I do n't know. I hope at least 300,000.'' New Forum, formed only in September as a national movement, has said it plans to contest the free elections promised by the Communists and due in 1991. But the group, which is far more organized in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, is trying to put the brake on calls for a vote next spring. It argues that fall 1990 is the earliest point it and other parties could stand on meaningful platforms. To a foreigner, the call for an orderly, slower reform may sound typically German. To East Germans baffled by the stunning changes of one short month, it sounds like a sensible breathing space and a chance to avoid mistakes. Reunification, they feel, should not be high on the political agenda. `` That's not a theme until the people here have really created something new,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuehrer </PERSON>, vicar of the <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> church whose weekly prayers for peace became the kernel of a mass pro-democracy demonstration. `` For 40 years,'' Fuehrer said, `` our identity was only three initials _ DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` Now, we have to learn our history which for years in schools here started with the revolution in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1917. We must know what is German. Then, maybe you can talk about reunification. But it's not something that can just be ordered, then administered. We've seen where that led for 40 years.'' The deep disillusionment with four decades of false promises and hardship comes through far more strongly in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Pure frustration drove these people onto the streets,'' said <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreilich </PERSON>, 32, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who has taken part in every Monday demonstration of the past two months. `` People were simply sick of being told what to do in every little thing,'' <PERSON> Dreilich </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> added a special factor to that despair. As second city, it has always had a great rivalry with <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and resented the resources poured into the capital and denied the provinces. Residents complain of polluted air and decrepit, peeling buildings. Side by side with a vibrant intellectual community are hundreds of thousands of workers toiling in outdated, polluting factories and thoroughly discontent with the rewards. `` For 28 years, we allowed ourselves to be oppressed,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, 43, from a small town outside <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. She has been marching for more democracy for the past eight Mondays. `` They exploited us,'' she said of the Communists. `` They grumble about capitalism, but they are much worse. And when I saw the police lined up here Oct. 9, I thought we got another 1938 -LRB- when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> assumed power -RRB-. The only difference was the uniforms.'' Such strong sentiments feed opposition hopes that the peaceful revolution can achieve much more than last weekend's massive East-West border bash. `` After 40 years in the ghetto, the lid is off, and of course the people want out,'' Fuehrer said. `` But for me as a churchman, things like the promise to an alternative to military service, something we fought for for 28 years, are more important than drinking beer on the Kudamm,'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s main street. `` The beer goes, but these real changes remain. Every hand and thinking head is needed here now.''

<HEAD>Open Borders Mean New Economic Hazards for Both Germanys</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders has exposed troubling economic hazards for both Germanys. The sight of millions of East Germans visiting <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> gives a hint of the onslaught that could result if living standards fail to rise to meet the growing expectations of East Germans. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> fears being further impoverished by West Germans using hard-currency clout to buy up property or subsidized goods in an accessible Eastern market. But <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> predicts that with market-oriented reforms, `` I'm convinced that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can reach our Western living standards within the next five to 10 years.'' <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s forecast and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s promise of massive aid in the style of the postwar <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan demonstrate the strength of West German interest in rebuilding the East German economy. But even with the best of intentions, the East German problems may be insurmountable. East Germans can rarely be reached by phone from the West because the hopelessly insufficient network is subject to breakdowns and equipment shortages. Consumers wait years to buy smoke-spewing Trabant and <ORGANIZATION> Wartburg </ORGANIZATION> cars that are the butt of jokes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the wheels of preference are the luxury Mercedes and BMW. Fresh fruit is seldom more than a memory in winter. Refrigerators, TVs and VCRs can cost several months' salary and break down two weeks later. Euphoria over travel freedom could quickly give way to frustration as East Germans discover firsthand the vast difference between their meager, burdened lifestyles and the prosperity of Western neighbors. And <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s constitutionally mandated practice of granting citizenship to ethnic Germans keeps the door wide open to permanent settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. More than 200,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, emptied of hope their nation could ever provide them with the life available next door. The deluge has ebbed considerably since the Stalinist controls on travel fell Thursday, but <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> recognizes the risks involved if reforms should fail. Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> on Tuesday offered an aid package for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> if the new leadership converts to a market system. But a leading East German economist, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenstern </PERSON>, said a free-market system is not the goal of his socialist state. Reform-oriented leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have not indicated how or when they will consider the critical step toward conversion to a hard-currency system. Even the most optimistic economists doubt a convertible East German mark could be achieved before the end of the century. Because the state needs to generate enough hard currency to buy priority equipment and commodities, it is forced to sell goods for export at only 15 percent of the cost of production, Finance Minister <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoefner </PERSON> disclosed Monday. Limited hard currency also puts up an effective ban on travel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the place of the physical one removed. `` In principle the people are free to travel, but in reality without the funds to do so they are still behind the barriers,'' said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Milzer </PERSON>, an economist with the West German federal <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. He said the West German government must kick in billions of marks to a travel fund to take the pressure off <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> while it reforms industries. Major West German firms have long eyed the potential for joint ventures, but most plans hinge on changes that are to far from socialist principles to be acceptable to the East German authorities. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> division said the electronics giant would love to work with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to revamp the antiquated phone system. `` But the conditions that have long hindered investment remain. Absolutely nothing in a legal or economic sense has changed,'' <PERSON> Flick </PERSON> said. On the side of optimism, however, the automotive giant <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> plans to send a delegation to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within a few days to discuss the prospects for joint production of passenger cars, said spokesman <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinert </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. Some investors fear the exodus of young workers _ a body blow to the already labor-short state _ further damages the prospect for improving productivity. `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> already had a critical demographic problem of an over-aged population, and the refugees have sharpened this development,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinglwagner </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoefner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> finance minister, disclosed the national debt was the equivalent of more than $ 70 billion, worse than Western economists had imagined. East German officials and opposition activists alike have expressed fears that a hard-currency hunger could result in a two-class system in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>: those with foreign money and those without. West German marks already command the best goods on the shortage-plagued market, and East Germans are worried they could be `` bought out'' unless customs controls are invoked. Prime real estate in central <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> may be opened up on the East side if the Communist government dismantles the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall's security zone That could ease the shortage of building land in both sectors of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. But the East has too little money to embark on major new capital investments, and Western investors still lack the confidence in the stability of East German reforms to commit funds for construction.

But he said he was helped by his mother, who insisted `` everything happens for a reason. ... Down the road something good will happen, and you'll realize it was for the best.''

 The latest weekly <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> ratings were filled with smiles as eight comedies, six of them <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s, were at the top. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> took a big lead for the week, in which the ratings chart looked like a virtual rerun of the previous week. Eight shows in the top 10 were repeats from the week before. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also had the three top-rated shows with `` The Cosby Show'' first, `` Cheers'' second and `` A Different World'' third. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was fourth <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey with an average prime-time rating of 15.4 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 12.7 and CBS' 11.8. Each point represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also took a lead in the November sweeps. Month-long sweeps occur three times a year and result in tough competition between networks. Advertising rates are based on the audience levels during the periods. The ratings for the first 11 days of sweeps: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 15.2, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.2, tied. After `` Roseanne,'' the rest of the top 10 were: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear John'' and `` Empty Nest'' tied, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years'' tied <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Small Sacrifices,'' in which <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> played a woman convicted of killing one of her own children, was the top-ranked non-regular show. It tied for 12th place with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Monday Night Football and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Manhunt: The Search for the Night Stalker,'' up against `` Small Sacrifices'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Return of <PERSON> McCloud </PERSON>,'' on Sunday, was 20th. `` McCloud'' tied for 39th place with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Matters.''

The time period is pre-empted this Tuesday by the final chapter of `` Small Sacrifices.'' The last part of the revolving wheel of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Saturday Mystery Movie, `` <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>,'' made its debut last week in 43rd place.

<HEAD>Bill Would Restrict U.S. Military Aid to Cambodian Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has acted to restrict the use of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> money to arm the non-communist guerrillas fighting the Vietnamese-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, according to a published report. A bill awaiting final passage would prevent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from using the agency's contingency funds to send weapons to the guerrillas unless he first gets approval from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Wednesday editions. Ordinarily, the administration does not need such approval to use <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> contingency funds. The restriction is part of a secret appendix to the military appropriations bill for the current fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The bill has emerged from a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and is awaiting final action by both houses. The non-communist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> belong to two groups that are linked in a loose coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which murdered up to 2 million people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> between 1975 and 1979. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> but favors the non-communist resistance, which Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has called `` the best hope to see a political settlement occur in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been providing food, medicine and other non-military aid to the non-communist guerrillas. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the non-communist forces should be strengthened as a means of encouraging the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government to agree to share power. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> declined to say whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was attempting to strengthen the rebel groups with military aid. Key members of the congressional appropriations committees strongly oppose any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military aid to the guerrillas, The Times reported. It quoted Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, as saying such aid could lead the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into `` a major new military involvement in the wars of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, torn by internal feuding and under fire in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would gain a six-month extension under legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The time has come in this country to put the petty bickering and the waste of the taxpayers' money on the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> behind us,'' Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., told committee members Tuesday The commission will go out of business Nov. 30 unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> extends it. Republicans and Democrats critical of the strife that has wracked the panel have so far been unable to agree on the length of the extension. Approved by the committee, 25-9, was a Democratic-sponsored, six-month extension that would keep on the front burner the question of how to reshape the commission and end its long-running internal feuds. The committee turned down a Republican plan to allow the commission to go out of business for one day only, thus allowing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to dump any members it opposes. It then would be reconstituted for six years. The Republican plan, offered by <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, was similar to a version recommended to the committee by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` We should not ram through a six-year bill in the closing days of this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chief supporter of the Democratic version He said he had initially sought a one-year extension but bowed to a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., to cut that time in half Twenty-five years ago, civil rights forces hailed the commission's hearings across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, its ringing reports on racial injustice and its bold legislative proposals. `` It served as the conscience of the nation,'' says <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Over the last six years, however, the commission has been snarled in fierce internal fighting. Lately, Democrats and Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have joined in slashing its budget. Controversy has dogged commission member <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, its former chairman. He most recently came under fire for a speech to a conservative group. The title was: `` Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who is black, calls himself the only conservative on the commission and says he does `` not believe in coddling people.'' In a 6-1 vote, the commission branded the speech `` thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.'' `` Frankly, it is a waste of the taxpayers' money to continue the prattle that has been coming out of the commission for another six months,'' <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> said. `` We would be better off with no civil rights commission than with this civil rights commission.'' Hostile exchanges between <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> commission member <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> have been at the heart of the controversy, he said. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., however, told the committee that `` anyone who was committed to the cause of civil rights who did not spend a lot of time disagreeing with chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> would be derelict in his or her duty, since he is one of the more bizarre public officials in my memory. <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> retorted that <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> `` has come up with some bizarre statements of her own.'' He said it was urgently necessary to take action to turn around the course of the commission. `` They have frankly made themselves into a national laughingstock,'' he said.

 `` Better safe than sorry'' is the motto of a public interest group that says Americans should act as watchdogs for their own pension plans. `` Like millions of Americans, a large part of your savings may be in a pension fund,'' says the Washington-based Pension Rights Center. `` But a Great Dane or a German Shepherd ca n't protect the money in your pension fund.'' The center publishes a booklet, which costs $ 6, titled `` Protecting Your Pension Money.'' It outlines your rights, as well as the rules that your pension plan's administrator must follow. Free pamphlets on the same subject are available from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Whether or not you have a pension plan is up to your employer. Only 46 percent of the nation's privately employed, full-time workers are covered by private pension plans. And only 40 million of the 76 million people covered by those plans are insured by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Pensions for employees working in offices or shops with fewer than 25 employees are not insured by the federal government. Retirement benefits are most commonly based on the number of years worked and final salary. Most plans have age and service requirements before an employee can participate, and similar rules for when the pension can be collected. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, sets rules for pension plans. All pension plans differ, but overall you have the right to: _ Find out the overall status of your plan by requesting in writing from your employer a `` Summary Plan Description'' outlining your company's plan _ Ask your plan administrator for a copy of your employer's Summary Annual Report, which details your company's _ Obtain a copy of the company's Form 5500, a more detailed financial report, available on written request from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Those running your plan must follow a number of rules. Among the most important: _ Your plan managers are required to invest the money with your best interests in mind They may not make investments to benefit themselves or your employer, if these conflict with your interests. _ Administrative costs of running your plan must be reasonable _ To hedge against risks, managers ca n't put all the pension money into one investment, such as a single stock or one piece of real estate If it appears the rules have been broken, you should notify the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. If you suspect the administrators have taken loans from the plan or had conflicts of interest, you should contact the Employee Plans Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> handles cases of kickbacks and embezzlement. `` The most effective way to convince government investigators to take a look at your problem is to provide them with a short summary of the problems you have found together with the supporting documents,'' the Pension Rights Center says. `` If you can not convince a government agency to investigate your plan, you might want to consider contacting a lawyer,'' it says.

<HEAD>Holiday Turkey Prices Down; Hams More Expensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices of holiday turkeys will be down from a year ago, but hams are going to be more expensive, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Consumers will find adequate supplies of turkey and ham for the holiday season,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. `` Prices likely will be lower for turkeys but higher for hams than last year.'' <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> production in the fourth quarter may be up about 12 percent from a year ago, with frozen inventories up slightly. Ham supplies are expected to decline slightly despite an increase in cold-storage stocks. `` Total red meat and poultry production is expected to set a record in 1989 and again in 1990,'' the report said. `` Among the major components, only beef production may decline in 1989, reflecting the reduced cattle inventory.'' Looking to 1990, the report said beef production may increase somewhat because of more cattle going into feedlots before slaughter, resulting in more `` fed'' beef. `` In both years, pork output could remain relatively large,'' the report said. `` Broiler output will continue to grow'' because of improved profits in recent years. `` <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> production also is expected to grow, but at a lower rate than broilers because returns are being squeezed.'' For producers, the report said more meat and poultry in 1990, along with `` weaker growth in per capita income,'' could put downward pressure on market prices. `` Increased red meats will be about offset by population growth,'' the report added. `` As a result, prices of choice-grade steers and -LRB- market hogs -RRB- should be a little above 1989's average. However, with higher per capita output, wholesale poultry prices are expected to decline moderately.'' Exports of beef and veal in 1989 could rise to a record of 1 billion pounds, up 46 percent from 1988 due largely to liberalization of the Japanese market, the report said. An additional increase of 12 percent to 15 percent is expected in 1990. Comparatively, total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef production in 1989 is forecast at 22.8 billion pounds, and pork at 15.8 billion pounds. Imports of beef and veal, mostly from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, are expected to decline about 8 percent this year from their 1988 level, mostly due to smaller supplies in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Declines are likely in 1990 because of smaller <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> shipments. Pork imports in 1989 are indicated at about 950 million pounds, down 16 percent from 1988, but those may rise to about 1 billion pounds in 1990 if Danish production continues to increase, the report said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork exports, mostly to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, are expected to be about 240 million pounds this year, up from 195 million in 1988. Those may decline to around 205 million pounds in 1990. Broiler exports may rise to a record of around 937 million pounds this year, up 22 percent from 1988. Most of the sales are commercial rather than under foreign aid and subsidy programs. Exports could decline slightly in 1990.

 The number of workers employed by farmers showed a seasonal decline in October but was up slightly from a year ago, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A quarterly report said Tuesday that the hired work force on farms was estimated at 983,000 during the week of Oct. 8-14, down from 1,197,000 in July. A year ago in October the work force was 976,000. Those did not include 308,000 `` agricultural service'' workers provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In July, those totaled 351,000 workers, and in October 1988 they were estimated at 274,000. Dry weather throughout most of the nation during the farm-labor survey week allowed corn and other row crop harvests to make good progress, the report said. The report said the national figures for hired workers had a sampling error of 3.5 percent. Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $ 5.42 per hour, up from $ 5.23 in July and $ 5.18 a year ago, the report said. For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage rate available, However, workers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were reported at $ 6.41 per hour, compared with $ 5.80 in July and $ 6.16 a year earlier in October 1988. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> workers averaged $ 5.15 per hour, compared with $ 5.55 in July and $ 4.98 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Four GOP Supporters of Abortion Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to abortion rights is `` not subject to change,'' though he will campaign next week for a pair of pro-choice House Republicans The two, Reps. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, were among four <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> women who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to press their point that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should remain open to those who do n't go along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to most abortions. `` We could see the wheels of thought going through his mind,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` I think he heard us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, took a step in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s direction on the question of federally funded abortions. The Appropriations Committee approved new versions of two spending bills <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed last month. The new versions comply with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for most abortions, including cases of rape or incest. However, one measure still could draw <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s objections by allowing the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to use local money for abortions. Abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight to loosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women, at least in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said it was time for the pro-choice side to accept that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will prevail for now and devote their energies toward another try next year. `` Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face the fact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` The president has to take responsibility for that decision.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would speak at a fund-raising event Monday for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who are planning 1990 races for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats in their respective states. Both have been advocates of abortion rights. They are among Republicans voicing concern that the party's anti-abortion platform and identification with abortion foes hurt it in the odd-year elections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections. `` Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's position is,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` The president supports all Republicans,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions that differ from him.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own views `` are based on his firm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change.'' Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, who also attended the meeting, said the Republicans gained no commitment from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and did not expect him to reverse positions. But, she said, they hoped `` there could be some gradations in his position'' in the future. `` We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about the implications for our party,'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said. `` We want to avoid political losses.'' Also attending was Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw most abortions. The appropriations panel approved without dissent the revised versions of a $ 157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor, education and health programs, and a bill appropriating $ 558 million for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed both last month because of their more liberal abortion provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of the larger bill last month marked the first time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction on federally financed abortions except in the cases where the mother's life is in danger But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed by 51 votes to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. Abortion opponents said they still objected to the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> bill, however, because it would permit the district government to use local money to pay for abortions for poor women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> objected to even that financing in his veto message, and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the new version would invite yet another veto. On still another abortion front, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> backed away from a threatened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $ 15 million for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund, a family planning effort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mitchell Wants Clean Air Bill First on January Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says he wants a comprehensive proposal to clean the nation's air as the first legislation considered by senators when they return from a recess in late January. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Tuesday that the scheduling is a response accusations by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of moving too slowly on the bill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> introduced his clean air proposal in July, calling it one of his top priorities and promising the plan would sharply reduce urban smog, toxic chemical air pollution and acid rain by the end of the century. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give him a clean air bill by the new year, but sponsors of the legislation said from the start that the timetable likely would not be met. Moments after <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, spoke to his colleagues on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on environmental protection, the panel completed work on clean air legislation and sent it to the full <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, members of the subcommittee complained the panel was moving so fast they lacked time to study last-minute acid rain proposals. The subcommittee, which previously completed work on the urban smog and toxic chemical portions of the legislation, approved acid rain language that incorporated much of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. The full committee will begin work Thursday. While senators began their consideration later than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, they have outpaced their counterparts. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to take up the bill until next year because lawmakers plan to begin their recess this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee accepted these <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals: _ A 10 million ton reduction by the end of the century in sulfur dioxide, the chief ingredient of acid rain _ A cap that would prevent any growth of acid rain emissions once reduction targets are met by Jan. 1, 2000 _ Placing the cleanup burden on 107 of the nation's dirtiest coal-burning utilities, mostly in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ A program of credits for utilities exceeding their reduction targets, which could then be sold to utilities seeking to expand capacity Other language, authored by subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., would go beyond the administration's proposal A second main ingredient of acid rain, nitrogen oxide, would be reduced by 1 million tons by 2000, while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation would permit a 1 million ton increase. Also, the <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> legislation's reduction deadline is a year ahead of the administration date Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that mixes in the atmosphere and is carried for hundreds of miles before falling in rain, snow, fog, mist and as dry particles. The pollution makes lakes and streams acidic, killing aquatic life; destroys trees, and can be harmful to human health. Much of the pollution comes from utilities that burn high sulfur coal, but other industrial facilities also contribute to the problem. The most controversial language added by <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> would allow six states to postpone meeting acid rain reduction targets, and to be assigned reductions more lenient than the rest of the country. The language would apply to states that emitted less than 150,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 1985, provided their utilities installed devices known as scrubbers to cut pollution. The break would go to <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>' state, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Another <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> provision would repeal a 1977 requirement that new coal-fired utilities install scrubbers. The purpose is to allow use of low sulfur coal without requiring this expensive technology.

<HEAD>Bidding Process Bypassed to Avert Shutdown of Weapons Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department bypassed the usual competitive bidding process in granting a $ 3.6 million consulting contract to avert a shutdown of key nuclear weapons plants, according to government records. The contract was given to <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month for `` specialized technical and administrative support'' of the department's effort to handle radioactive wastes generated by the federal nuclear weapons complex, according to an internal department memorandum made public Tuesday by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. The document said that unless a `` bridge contract,'' or extension of <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION>'s original work agreement, was granted for at least six months starting Nov. 1, at least three weapons production facilities might have been forced to close. Such a closure would have effectively paralyzed the production of nuclear arms. The three sites are the Rocky Flats plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that is the nation's only producer of plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads; the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the sole source of tritium to boost the explosive power of warheads; and the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, which recovers enriched uranium from fuel used by naval and research reactors. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> outlining what <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> called excessive use of private consultants to do government work, including drafting letters to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and writing memos to field office managers. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said this raised troubling questions about potential conflicts of interest. `` I question if <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> as a whole is serious in addressing this issue,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, who has criticized federal use of consultants and contractors for years, said he was astounded to learn during an investigation by his staff that some weapons plants might have been forced to close if <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> were not kept on the department's payroll. A document issued by the department's office of procurement operations said <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> was `` the only company which can provide the required continuity'' to carry out the waste management work. It added: `` Only <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> staff, through their 29 months of constant contact with the program, is cognizant of the current status of each project.'' `` That is total dependency on a major contractor'' for work that the government's own employees should be performing, <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no response Tuesday to <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s remarks. <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> said the appropriate officials to respond to questions were not available. The documents released by <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> indicate that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had used up its available work hours by <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> faster than planned. Thus an emergency `` bridge contract'' for 6 to 9 months was sought to continue the consultants' work on various nuclear waste projects until a new long-term contract could be awarded. The usual competitive bidding process for a new long-term contract was started July 7, but that process can not be completed until at least next March, the documents said. A department memorandum to Undersecretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, dated Oct. 31, said a decision to grant the emergency contract should take into account the likely publicity resulting from <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s staff investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION> matter. `` It may be argued that the ` emergency' award of a letter ` bridge' contract modification demonstrates Sen. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s point that the government is being performed by invisible contractors performing vital federal functions,'' <PERSON> Berton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of the directorate of procurement and assistance management said in the memo to Tuck. The memo indicates that Tuck approved the emergency contract on Oct. 31.

 Surreptitiously, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> smuggled aid into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to keep the spirit of Solidarity alive while <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was under arrest, and publicly _ very publicly _ <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is thanking his benefactors. On his visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he kept tossing bouquets. He threw a bear hug around a beaming `` Brother Kirkland'' _ <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> _ Tuesday and thanked <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for receiving him. He sounded like a happy tourist. `` It seems to me that no country has so many trees in the streets,'' he marveled. This shipyard electrician from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> went before the labor federation to revel in `` the bond of friendship between Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'' which had been `` shaped over the years, both good and bad.'' During <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s nine-year ordeal, which has resulted in a non-communist government peacefully taking power in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> arranged quietly to provide about $ 5 million in help. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> sent into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the printing presses Solidarity needed to circulate its message. When the authorities discovered a press and seized it, another would be delivered in the night. In repayment, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a piece of the action, a hero to cheer, while history unfolds in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is officially cautious about events in the Soviet bloc, but even President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could set aside prudence Monday night and welcome a teary <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as `` the spiritual godfather of a new generation.'' To address his colleagues in the labor movement, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> stuck a union button in his lapel. When he arrived, the labor leaders stood and cheered him for 15 minutes. He even brought a historic fact: the `` first strike in American history, in the <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> colony,'' in 1619, was staged by Poles. `` Some of my countrymen _ glassworkers,'' he said, recalling that bit of labor history, `` lit a flame of freedom and human dignity that is burning to this day at home, in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Organized labor here has had its own bad years recently. Membership growth is stagnant. Fewer than one worker in six is unionized. The strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has been costly and ineffective. Praise from an international hero could hardly have been more welcome. At a news conference, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, his words translated sentence by sentence, pleaded for more help for a <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that he said is desperate and ripe for investment. Two-thirds of its apartment houses, he said, are slums and its automobiles are antiques that pollute and `` gulp gasoline like monsters.'' `` Our children and grandchildren will laugh at us because we had poverty, but tanks and missiles _ those were plentiful.'' If American banks were willing to make loans when it was run by the communists, he said, they should be willing to help now. `` In <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, everything is in short supply, even, or rather first and foremost, time,'' he said. `` No one knows how much time we have left to reform our economy, but we all feel it is not much. If we fail to convince people that although things are changing perhaps too slowly they are nevertheless changing for the better, then this breeze of freedom I spoke of will soon disappear, leaving behind only a sense of bitterness accompanying unaccomplished dreams. `` It will result in a defeat for us, but not only for us.'' When he finished speaking, the union chiefs in his audience _ leaders of the garment workers, the carpenters, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, the musicians, the schoolteachers _ linked arms and serenaded him with an old union song whose title took on a new twist, `` Solidarity Forever.''

<HEAD>Industry Group Urges Sales Suspension of L-tryptophan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Makers of L-tryptophan are suspending distribution and sales of the dietary supplement because of its possible link to a potentially fatal blood disorder, an industry group says. The Council for Responsible Nutrition called for the temporary sales halt as a `` prudent and cautious course of action'' even though no link has been established between the non-prescription supplement and the disorder. Some companies started halting sales soon after the council called for the action Tuesday afternoon, said <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordaro </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based council that represents nutritional supplement companies, including most makers of L-tryptophan. He said he expected virtually all makers of the product to comply with the council's call by Thursday. Officials were investigating 81 unconfirmed cases of the disorder, known as eosinophilia, in 17 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Monday banned L-tryptophan. Oregon's Health Division recommended the product be withdrawn, and health officials in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> recommended that people avoid using L-tryptophan. The council's action pertains to the food supplement that is sold in tablet and capsule form, which is used for sleeplessness and premenstrual syndrome. It does not cover multi-ingredient products that also contain L-tryptophan. `` This action should not be viewed as a product recall but an interim measure pending clarification of the causes of this outbreak,'' the council said. `` Public health agencies investigating have not been able to establish a scientific basis or isolate medical evidence that links L-tryptophan with this disorder,'' the council said. `` In addition, to date <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and industry testing of L-tryptophan products have not identified any product contamination.'' A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON>, said the agency was satisfied with the industry's action. <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> said that without a stronger cause-and-effect link, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has no authority to order a recall. He said the strongest action the agency could take was announced Saturday when it advised people taking L-tryptophan to discontinue use of the product. At least 12 different brands of L-tryptophan have been identified as having been used by the individuals who became ill in recent weeks. Eosinophilia is marked by a higher than normal number of white blood cells known as eosinophils. Symptoms include severe muscle pain, fever, joint pain, weakness, swelling of the arms and legs and skin rash.

<HEAD>$3.2 Billion Increase in Drug War Sent to Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An additional $ 3.2 billion to finance the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's war on drugs is heading for the president's desk after getting final congressional approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Under the measure, anti-drug funds would climb to $ 8.8 billion this year, $ 900 million more than requested by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sept. 5 in a nationally televised address outlining his plan of attack on narcotics. Approval of the funds represents the major congressional action on the drug issue thus far this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are forming a fresh conference committee to try to resolve differences over non-money items, including the administration's so-called Andean Strategy. The funds were included in an overall $ 12 billion money bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The rest of the transportation bill received final congressional approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week with only the anti-drug money drawing fire. It was approved Tuesday by unanimous consent without discussion. All but a few details had been worked out between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators in September. The conference committee last month dropped all non-money items but made only minor funding changes. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the money Nov. 1 on a voice vote. Included in the package is $ 1 billion for the federal prison system for buildings, $ 308 million for law enforcement grants to state and local governments as well as $ 727 million for programs involving alcohol, drug abuse and mental health. The House on Monday approved four bills containing the non-money items that had been detached from the package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday considered those four bills, substituted its own version for the language approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and sent the measures to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. The primary measure would authorize military training and law enforcement assistance for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> under the administration's so-called Andean Strategy. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other countries also would receive aid under the proposal. Other measures would expand a drug-free schools program approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, allow transfers out of the fund for assets seized from drug dealers and divide the alcohol, drug abuse and mental health block grant program into separate programs for substance abuse and mental health. The overall transportation bill permanently prohibits smoking aboard nearly all airline flights within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Smoking would be allowed on flights originating in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> or bound for those states and scheduled to last longer than six hours _ about 28 out of 17,500 daily <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights. Currently, smoking is banned on flights lasting two hours or less. The new rules would take effect 96 days after the measure is signed into law. The same measure provides $ 12 billion for federal transportation programs for the new fiscal year. The bill includes $ 30.7 million to subsidize air carriers that serve small towns, and a $ 40 million down payment to build a new airport in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the first new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airport in 15 years.

<HEAD>Subcommittee OKs Backhauling Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation to force federal authorities to restrict the shipment of food in rail cars or trucks that also ship garbage or hazardous materials is proceeding through the House. The Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation, tourism and hazardous materials approved the legislation Tuesday after testimony last week described a practice known as `` backhauling.'' Backhauling, intended to increase the revenues of shippers, means carrying a cargo on the return trip after making an original shipment. Recent hearings and news reports have documented how shippers bringing food from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to the East have carryied return loads of garbage because eastern landfills are overflowing. The bill would require the administration to determine which cargoes may be backhauled and what procedure are needed to clean the vehicles when backhauling is permitted. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the bill is intended to give flexibility to regulators. `` This is not intended to be a veto or elimination of any backhauling,'' he said. `` We do n't want to foul up or create blockades within the food distribution system.'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> represents <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, a major supermarket chain, has its headquarters. The bill is part of larger legislation dealing with hazardous shipments, including the safety of hazardous chemical shipments by rail. The spinoff bill was created because of publicity generated by the hearing. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> surface transportation subcommittee is putting the final touches on related legislation, and the full committee is scheduled to vote on it Thursday. The bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON>, R-Pa., forbids backhauling of municipal solid waste in refrigerated food trucks and forbids mixed use of tank trucks or cars for hauling both food and non-food items

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving rapidly to reinforce <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s dramatic political and economic changes with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, creating a three-year, $ 657 million aid program and providing the first hard cash to back up that promise. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 on Tuesday to support new business enterprises, stabilize currency, provide emergency food and encourage democratic institutions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, on the eve of Solidarity labor leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s speech to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The measure also included $ 81 million in aid for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, this is for you and a free <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a primary sponsor of the aid measure Both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have been in the forefront of the wave of reform sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that includes radical opening of political institutions and restructuring of economies along Western lines. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moved to put the first dollars into the new program, voting 324-93 for a foreign aid bill that includes $ 293 million in the current year, along with another $ 240 million in standby credit and trade insurance. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure, a $ 14.6 billion bill providing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to allies around the globe, also offered up to $ 85 million for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s besieged military and $ 125 million to help Andean countries fight the drug war. But the money bill was the subject of a White House veto threat because of a provision, growing out of the Iran-Contra scandal, which would bar use of foreign aid to entice other countries to carry out policies contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The administration believed the language would tie its hands in dealings with allies. Another potentially contentious issue in the $ 14.6 billion bill was defused when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 219 to 203 to give President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the right to withhold $ 15 million for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund if he finds the agency supports forced abortions or sterilizations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The measure now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. For <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, major elements of the appropriations measure included a $ 200 million grant to help stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s battered economy and $ 45 million for a private enterprise development fund Other money would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and cultural exchanges. The bill creating the long-term aid program represented an apparent truce in a game of one-upsmanship between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and congressional Democrats over who could provide the biggest reward to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed a $ 455 million program which was immediately labeled `` timid'' by Democrats, who proposed upwards of $ 1 billion in aid. As passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the measure offers $ 200 million in currency stabilization, $ 400 million in enterprise funds and $ 125 million in food aid. Recognizing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s serious economic problems and a reform plan advanced to address them, the bill allocates $ 657 million for that country over three years. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive $ 81 million. Overall, the foreign aid appropriations bill included $ 4.7 billion in military aid and $ 3.2 billion in economic aid for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> friends and allies around the world. Among major earmarks for countries in the bill were $ 3 billion for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and $ 2.1 billion for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, always the largest aid recipients because of their participation in the Camp David peace process. Other large recipients included <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with $ 460 million in military and economic aid; <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, $ 500 million in military aid; <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, $ 350 million in military aid; and $ 63 million in military and economic aid for <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. In addition, the agreement provides $ 160 million for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, $ 83 million for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> relief, $ 83 million for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and $ 30 million in military aid to countries in <LOCATION> Sub-Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 A package of reforms for the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> is heading for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after winning House approval. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed overwhelmingly on a voice vote Tuesday evening to approve the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> reform package, which includes proposals from Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as well as others arising from a congressional investigation of the department's multibillion-dollar scandals. `` I believe the bill allows us to get the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals behind us,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that approved the measure. The action came after his panel, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee on housing and community development, last week stripped away a larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs. Some Democrats had hoped to keep the two linked as a way to force congressional action on the housing program revision. The bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs register with the department and identify for whom they are working, as well as any fees they receive. Civil penalties would be imposed for those who fail to comply, and recipients of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants would have to report their use of consultants and lobbyists. Other provisions: _ Create a new <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> chief financial officer's position, as well as a comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to oversee financial management It includes reforms in the FHA-insured mortgage program, including a prohibition on loans for second homes. _ Apply new restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housing that were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling and political favoritism in the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals The bill limits the number of housing units that may be subsidized per project to 100. _ Authorize $ 25 million for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to monitor and evaluate its programs _ less than the one-half of 1 percent of program spending, or about $ 100 million, that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> sought _ Require full disclosure of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding decisions, and place restrictions on accounts for which the secretary has discretionary authority _ Increase from 60 percent to 75 percent the amount of assistance under the Community Development Block Grant that must be used for projects benefiting the poor <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had proposed an even tighter requirement that spending go for the poor. _ Restrict the administration's ability to fire the department's inspector

<HEAD>Hooded Former Drug Dealer Says Destroy Coca Crops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A convicted drug dealer says the only way to stop the cocaine trade is to destroy the coca crop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Cut off the snake's head and the snake will die,'' he said. `` Go after the crop or the chemicals that process the coca. I do n't think anything else will do any good. The witness who wore a black hood to conceal his identity _ `` Mr. Witness,'' the congressmen called him _ insisted to a skeptical <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Tuesday that stepped up efforts to interdict the drug flow are fruitless. Wiping out the coca crop in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and surrounding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations might result in substitute crops springing up in other regions of the world, he said, adding that such a move would buy time. `` What we need now is a breather. It would take two to three years to re-establish a useable crop of coca,'' he said. `` During that time we could take steps to see that it is not done.'' Such a move, he said, would be `` more practical than what we're doing now. The witness, arrested in 1985 after several years of overseeing huge cocaine shipments from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said nothing can stop the flow of cocaine once the coca crop is harvested and processed into the drug. He said the drug importing cartels can change their tactics `` instantly'' to circumvent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enforcement moves. For example, he said if efforts are concentrated on sealing off borders along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the importers say: `` We'll let you have fun there, we'll bring the stuff through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' The witness was accompanied by a group of federal marshals during his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance. His voice was distorted electronically to help protect his identity. He said he is convinced the people of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> would support eradication of coca crops if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided economic aid for poor coca farmers to replace their lost income. `` The cartel had the popular support of the people, but not now,'' he said. `` All these bombings and raids have done more to hurt the common man than anyone else.'' He said he did n't `` know anything about money laundering,'' the subcommittee's main area of jurisdiction in drug laws, but suggested currency financial restrictions are n't as important as several subcommittee members believe.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has cut its defense spending, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says it ca n't provide an estimate until the year is over. `` It's too early to give a final estimate of Soviet defense spending for 1989,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` However, it does appear that Soviet defense spending this year is less than it was last year.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has seen evidence of cuts in Soviet defense efforts, including reductions in the production of conventional weapons, she said. `` We have also seen withdrawals of conventional weapons and troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> estimates of Soviet military spending show a 1.5 percent decline for this year, and intelligence officials project a decline of 7 percent for 1990, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Wednesday editions, citing anonymous sources. Last week, at an arms control seminar near <LOCATION> Queenstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters that the Soviets had cut tank production and slowed production of Typhoon nuclear submarines. The official, who could not be identified under seminar rules, said there was `` credible evidence'' of a cutback in tank output. But <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, echoing statements made earlier this week by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, disputed reports the Soviets had slowed the modernization of some long-range nuclear weapons or had evidence of cutbacks in conventional arms. `` There's obviously no way of knowing for sure what spending for'89 is until 1989 is over,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. However, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said `` the experts'' believe there have been reductions. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said two weeks ago that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had basically fulfilled his pledge to reduce tank divisions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised last December to withdraw six divisions over two years. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, who recently visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said regiments amounting to three divisions had been withdrawn. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also promised to cut military spending by 14 percent and to remove 500,000 men from the Soviet armed forces.

<HEAD>Alcohol Warning Labels Ready; Some Complain They're Too Small</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of a law requiring all new bottles and cans of alcoholic beverages to carry a warning directed at drivers and pregnant women are complaining that the warning is too small. `` It's almost impossible to read,'' Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said Tuesday, pointing at a sample beer bottle `` The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> has purposely allowed the industry to come up with a label that is illegible.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was joined by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, and several public and private medical officials in lambasting the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> for allowing distillers and brewers to print the warning in small, narrow type _ half the size of newspaper type, in many cases. Under the law that becomes effective Saturday, the label of each can or bottle of alcoholic beverages must carry these words: `` Government Warning: -LRB- 1 -RRB- According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. -LRB- 2 -RRB- Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery and may cause health problems.'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the first part of the warning is especially necessary, because many Americans remain unaware that alcohol is the leading recognizable cause of mental retardation in infants. Under the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>'s temporary regulation implementing the law, the warning may be affixed virtually anywhere on a bottle or can. Dot <PERSON> Koester </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, took note of the criticism and said: `` Remember, this is a temporary rule. We hope to get our final regulations out before the end of the year, and certainly we'll be considering everybody's complaints.'' Alcoholic beverages bottled or canned as of Saturday must have the new warning _ not those already on the shelves. Even for beer, it could take months for the new labels to turn up in stores. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, administrator of the Alcohol, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said fetal alcohol syndrome, a cluster of irreversible birth defects, affects 2.2 of every 1,000 infants born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It ranks ahead of Down's syndrome and spina bifida as a cause of mental retardation, he said <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> stressed there `` is no known safe level of alcohol consumption'' for pregnant women. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Beer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry lobbying arm, said: `` We believe the information on the labels should have little or no impact since the risks of alcohol abuse are common knowledge to the public. The temporary regulations for the size and placement of the labels are reasonable; however, we will comply with whatever final regulations are issued.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Four GOP Supporters of Abortion Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The White House says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to abortion rights is `` not subject to change,'' though he will campaign next week for a pair of pro-choice House Republicans The two, Reps. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, were among four <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> women who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to press their point that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should remain open to those who do n't go along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to most abortions. `` We could see the wheels of thought going through his mind,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` I think he heard us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, took a step in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s direction on the question of federally funded abortions. The Appropriations Committee approved new versions of two spending bills <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed last month. The new versions comply with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for most abortions, including cases of rape or incest. However, one measure still could draw <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s objections by allowing the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to use local money for abortions. Abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight to loosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women, at least in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said it was time for the pro-choice side to accept that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will prevail for now and devote their energies toward another try next year. `` Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face the fact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` The president has to take responsibility for that decision.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would speak at a fund-raising event Monday for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who are planning 1990 races for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats in their respective states. Both have been advocates of abortion rights. They are among Republicans voicing concern that the party's anti-abortion platform and identification with abortion foes hurt it in the odd-year elections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections. `` Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's position is,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` The president supports all Republicans,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions that differ from him.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own views `` are based on his firm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change.'' Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, who also attended the meeting, said the Republicans gained no commitment from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and did not expect him to reverse positions. But, she said, they hoped `` there could be some gradations in his position'' in the future. `` We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about the implications for our party,'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said. `` We want to avoid political losses.'' Also attending was Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw most abortions. The appropriations panel approved without dissent the revised versions of a $ 157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor, education and health programs, and a bill appropriating $ 558 million for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed both last month because of their more liberal abortion provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of the larger bill last month marked the first time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction on federally financed abortions except in the cases where the mother's life is in danger But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed by 51 votes to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. Abortion opponents said they still objected to the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> bill, however, because it would permit the district government to use local money to pay for abortions for poor women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> objected to even that financing in his veto message, and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the new version would invite yet another veto. On still another abortion front, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> backed away from a threatened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $ 15 million for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund, a family planning effort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Index Hits Record High; Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended at a record high Wednesday, while the dollar edged down against the yen. The dollar closed at 143.37 yen, down 0.43 yen from Tuesday's 143.80-yen finish It opened at 143.23 yen and ranged between 143.18 yen and 143.40 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 83.59 points, or 0.23 percent, closing at 35,852.23, yet another high. The index had gained 18.52 points for a record closing of 35,768.64 Tuesday. `` The index rose following Tuesday's release of the domestic wholesale price index,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wholesale price index in October fell by 0.6 percentage points from a month earlier, the first decline in 11 months. The dealer said the decline reassured market players that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s interest rates are no longer likely to rise higher. Lower interest rates encourage stock buying. In currency dealings, the dollar's drop followed a similar downswing overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, triggered by steeper-than-expected slides in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported Tuesday that the nation's retail sales fell 1 percent in October, while industrial production dropped 0.7 percentage points that month. Dealers said market players were inclined to sell the dollar and buy the yen expecting that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy will be eased. A Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency will contine to move narrowly around its opening level until the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for September, due out in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday.

<TEXT>
 An open ambulance speeds down a narrow street, siren screaming. A bleeding woman in a rose-colored dress lies sprawled in the back, surrounded by helmeted rescue workers. What is left of downtown street life pauses for a moment as the war wails past. A woman's hand offering a slice of papaya freezes in midair. Eyes track the truck's swift passage. At the Hospital <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, the wounded lie on stretchers lining the hallways. A wounded child stares vacantly into space. Someone mops a pool of blood from the floor. For the first time in a decade of civil war, the capital is the battlefield. Some people try to carry on, despite the fighting, despite the rebel traffic ban and despite the government curfew and state of seige. Most simply stay home. The vast majority of businesses have been shuttered since the offensive began Saturday. Traffic is sparse. Many of those who venture out carry improvised white flags. Dogs bark, rockets whistle, mortars thud and sirens wail. The sounds are sharp, unmuffled by the usual din of traffic. Evening brings a rainbow that arcs from a sunlit volcano into the cloud-darkened sky. A helicopter gunship makes a pass, punctuating the scene with the insistence of war. Combat intensifies with the darkness. Many areas are without power after rebels sabotage power lines. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s sleep is disturbed by the sound of a nearby rebel assault. The next morning the fence around his home shows the scars of several bullets. Some areas of the city are full-fledged combat zones. In <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION>, one of the neighborhoods on in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> occupied by leftist guerrillas, a stream of people flowed down the hill Tuesday morning. They said they were afraid of another strafing run by government gunships. They begged reporters to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to help evacuate them. `` Tell them there are babies here, tell them there are children,'' one woman cried. Other residents stood side by side with rebel fighters. `` The people are making their own decision'' whether to stay or go, insisted rebel leader <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabindranath </PERSON> <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON>. He led a mix of new recruits, some as young as 13, and battle-hardened fighters from the countryside, the main theater of war before this offensive. The fighters include people, like <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON>, from the top ranks of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The sights and sounds of war have been banned from the airwaves. All broadcasters were put under the aegis of the national network when the offensive began and there is a virtual news blackout. What is broadcast is carefully selected. The head of the armed forces general staff, Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, went on television Monday night to say the rebels controlled no territory. But residents of <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION>, where five-story apartment houses abut settlers' tin shacks, know differently. Food, water and medicine in <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION> were running short by Tuesday, but ammunition was not, the rebels said. Spent shells and broken glass littered the ground. Fire crackled from rebel sharpshooters perched in top floors. An air force helicopter passed high overhead, out of range of rebel groundfire. How long, one fighter was asked, would the rebels try to hold out? `` Until we win or die,'' he said.

<HEAD>Upsurge In Sports Cable Broadcasts Defended By Tagliabue, Vincent</HEAD>

 Professional football and baseball commissioners say the move of sports programming to cable is making games available to more, not fewer, fans. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagliabue </PERSON> and Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> sat side-by-side during a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee hearing Tuesday, and were grilled by lawmakers about the shift of baseball and football telecasts to <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> and other cable networks. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> said in a prepared statement that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should get involved because the trend was `` leading to a sports blackout for nearly half of the nation which does not have cable.'' NAB President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could direct the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to reinstitute anti-siphoning rules, which have not been in place since 1977, to assure viewers access to sports broadcasts. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., asked <PERSON> Tagliabue </PERSON> for a `` flat commitment'' that fans would not begin to be assessed a flat fee to view a broadcast of pro football's jewel, the Super Bowl Such a `` pay-per-view'' arrangement is used for some top-draw boxing matches. `` For the balance of this century, we do not foresee pay-per-view for the Super Bowl game,'' <PERSON> Tagliabue </PERSON> said. He said he could not foresee what might happen after that.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the would-be `` education president,'' is blocking the education secretary from doing a good job.

 The sponsor of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill to help firefighters wants to pay for it by having the government mint and sell a commemorative coin.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, the boulder marking the spot where the Pilgrims landed 369 years ago, is in danger of splitting in two. But a mason says he'll preserve it in time for Thanksgiving. `` I do n't look at it as a job, I look at it as a privilege to preserve something that means a lot to people all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, who planned to start work on the rock today. He bid $ 1 to win the contract to patch up the historic landmark, where Pilgrims are said to have first set foot on American land in 1620. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON>, a geotechnical engineer hired by the state's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to analyze the rock, has concluded that the rock's crack will worsen if left unattended `` It would look terribly embarrassing if it split in half,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, a department spokesman. The crack first appeared in 1774, when the 6-ton boulder was dropped during an attempt to move it to the town square, breaking it in two. The smaller piece was used for the town display, but because tourists kept chipping away at the monument, guardians of the rock decided to glue it back to its partner in 1880. That job has stood up to the tides that occasionally submerge the rock, which is 14 feet wide and 6 feet long and stands in a half-enclosed protective structure in the waters off of this seaside town. The mortar, however, is deteriorating. State and town officials fear water that seeps into the rock will freeze, causing further fissures or worse. The main crack is about 2 -LCB- feet long. <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> said repairs could be completed in one day. He said he's not using high-tech glues or epoxy, because scientists want to be able to undo his work without damaging the rock if more substantial repairs become necessary. He has prepared a special mortar mixed to match the color and consistency of the 19th century repairs, but he declined to reveal his mix, beyond saying it contained `` small pebbles.'' <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON>, a mason for 22 years, said he also will fix a series of hairline cracks that have developed within the main fracture and in some other areas of the rock. The smaller cracks were caused by the vibrations of the tourist buses that rumble over the road about 5 feet from the landmark, he said. Two masons submited bids. <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> was chosen after the other mason asked for about $ 100. `` It just makes me feel good,'' <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> said. `` It's just knowing what it stands for. It's a symbol of freedom and how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> supposedly started off.''

<HEAD>Medicines Turn Back Damage of Too Much Cholesterol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three studies provide new dramatic evidence that people with heart disease who cut down on cholesterol can actually begin to clean out the clogged arteries that threaten their lives. `` All three studies show that whether you use diet or drugs, you can lower cholesterol dramatically,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON> of the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` The greater your reduction in cholesterol, the greater your reduction in heart disease.'' Cholesterol kills by plugging up the blood vessels that feed the heart's own muscle. The latest studies show that when people take cholesterol-lowering medicines or go on strict vegetarian diets, they can stop new fatty deposits from building up in their arteries. Often they can actually turn back the clock, eliminating some of the damage of a lifetime of too much cholesterol. `` We are excited about these results,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` They strengthen our resolve to try to save more lives by lowering cholesterol.'' The studies were cited by some of the nation's top heart experts as they sought to quiet doubts that have been raised about the wisdom _ or need _ of lowering everyone's cholesterol. The three reports were presented Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, along with a joint statement by the heart association and the heart institute. The report, called `` The Cholesterol Facts,'' was intended to rebut a September article in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Monthly. In the article, `` The Cholesterol Myth,'' Washington-based writer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> argued there is no firm proof that lowering blood cholesterol levels saves lives or that people live longer by changing what they eat. The doctors countered that evidence to the contrary is overwhelming. Their point-by-point challenge of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s report concluded that `` the evidence more than justifies the current national campaign for cholesterol control.'' Six of the nation's most prominent heart experts presented the joint statement and outlined the case against cholesterol. `` If you give the message that cholesterol is a myth, it is wrong. It is important that we detect and treat it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRosa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> could not be reached to respond. There was no answer at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, the only location his publisher said he could be reached at. The doctors cited 36 different studies, including several not mentioned in <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s article. They said he had ignored some of the most persuasive data, including animal and population studies, and misread other research. `` There is overwhelming data that in addition to lessening your heart attack risk in your 40s, 50s and 60s, you will live a little longer by following a better diet,'' said another panel member, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Castelli </PERSON> of the Framingham Heart Study in suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Two of the studies presented Tuesday relied on medicines to lower cholesterol in people at a high risk of heart trouble. Dr. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> put people on two combinations of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Over five years, the fatty buildups shrank in 35 percent and got bigger in 23 percent. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenhorn </PERSON> and colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> also found a significant slowing of the disease in people treated for four years with cholesterol medicine. In the third study, Dr. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornish </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, put subjects on strict vegetarian diets and had them participate in exercise and relaxation programs. After one year, 82 percent showed overall regression of artery deposits. Even though these and many other studies were conducted on people at the highest risk of heart trouble, the doctors contended that sensible eating and lower cholesterol are good for everyone. `` Not only does diet make a difference, it is the major approach to cholesterol lowering across the board,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bad News For Drinkers: Booze Linked With Enlarged Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For those who enjoy a drink or two each day, the latest news from medical research is bad _ especially if they are over age 50. The research suggests that drinking causes dangerous enlargement of the heart. And the doctors who conducted the study say it convinces them that older people should give up booze entirely for the sake of their hearts. The study found an association between alcohol consumption and enlargement of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber. `` Even the smallest doses of alcohol seem to have some effect on left ventricular mass,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manolio </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The findings were based on information from 1,968 men and 2,505 women who took part in the Framingham Heart Study in suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Age is also a factor,'' said <PERSON> Manolio </PERSON>, `` and our conclusion is that anyone past the age of 50 or so _ and certainly anyone who already has an enlarged heart _ would be better off not drinking at all.'' Left ventricular enlargement is associated with dangerous irregular heart rhythms. The more ventricular size increases, the greater the risk of heart failure and death. The link was most pronounced in men. While women's hearts appear to be less susceptible to the bad effects of alcohol, the researchers said this may simply be because women typically drink less than men. The research was presented Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>`Batman' Fans Line up For Video</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Bat fans fluttered around video stores early today to swoop in and pick up the first available copies of `` Batman _ The Videocassette.'' A spotlight outside the Tower Video store in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> cast the Batman logo on the sky above <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> while the Batmobile rolled up and the Joker jumped out, bearing bags filled with the coveted Batvideos. Fans also lined up elsewhere. `` We sold 100 within the first 40 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, department supervisor at Tower Video in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. But as the videocassette was released nationally at midnight Tuesday, its expected blockbuster sales were making some in the entertainment industry as grim as the Caped Crusader himself. `` Batman'' is still playing in more than 500 North American theaters, according to the latest box-office figures.

 After replacing a flawed computer on its last unmanned rocket, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> set Saturday for the launch of the first of several satellites that will reveal an `` unbelievable view of the universe.'' `` Hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the world of science,'' program scientist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caroff </PERSON> said of the Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft and four observatories that will be placed in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit during the 1990s. Saturday's launch of the $ 150 million Explorer spacecraft _ the centerpiece of a $ 400 million mission _ `` is going to begin an explosion of knowledge about the universe,'' program manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The 4,850-pound Explorer will provide clues to the development of the universe by measuring radiation left over from the `` big bang,'' the explosion scientists say created the universe 15 billion years ago. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said the Explorer will be followed by the launches of what <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> calls its `` great observatories'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> next March, the <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in June, the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility in 1997 and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility in 1999. `` These are going to provide us with an unprecedented, unbelievable view of the universe,'' <PERSON> Caroff </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We will see things we have n't even imagined.'' The Explorer is scheduled for launch from <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> during a 30-minute period starting at 6:24 a.m. PST Saturday, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>, project manager at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, Md. The launch had been scheduled for Friday, then was delayed until Sunday because of a malfunctioning rocket guidance computer. But the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the launch was moved again, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> rocket official. The solar-powered satellite will be carried into a near-polar orbit by a 116-foot-tall <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket _ the last unmanned, expendable rocket ever to be launched by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will continue to launch manned shuttles and possibly unmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters. But <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or private companies will charge <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to launch any payloads that require unmanned expendable rockets. After a 30-day shakedown in orbit, the Explorer will spend up to two years measuring `` cosmic background radiation,'' which makes up about 2 percent of the static on a television set. It includes microwaves, heat and other electromagnetic radiation given off by the big bang. The Explorer will measure `` the collective glow of all the stars and galaxies and whatever else has been there since the beginning,'' project scientist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will share information from the mission with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has flown one similar research mission and plans two others.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rose to a record high today, while the dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen. The dollar ended trading at 143.37 yen, down 0.43 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen. The currency opened lower at 143.23 yen and ranged between 143.18 yen and 143.40 yen. `` Trading today was totally directionless and boring,'' said a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. `` Ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, the dollar-yen rate moved only narrowly.'' The trader said <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is expecting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for September to shrink to $ 8.5 billion. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s trade figure announcement is scheduled for Thursday. On the stock exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues gained 83.59 points, or 0.23 percent. It ended at 35,852.23, renewing the record high for the third-consecutive time since Monday. The index, which has been rising since last Wednesday, has gained more than 580 points. The index slowed its upward movement in the afternoon session as participants sold for profit-taking and arbitrary deals, which resulted in wild fluctuations in the index, dealers said. <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said market players' buying incentive was not strong enough for a larger one-day gain even after a report that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wholesale price index fell by 0.6 percentage points from a month earlier. It was the first drop in the last 11 months. `` Investors would n't start buying all of a sudden just because of the wholesale price index, becuase our domestic short term interst rate has n't fallen,'' he said. `` Market players will increase buying gradually as they make sure external economic factors are stable enough,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> added. An estimated 1.2 billion shares changed hands on the first section, up from Tuesday's 900 million. Among the winners were construction, railway and financial issues.

<BYLINE>Columbia Astronauts Hope to Bring Back Giant ``Christmas Present''

<TEXT>
 The astronauts aboard next month's space shuttle mission hope to return home with a bus-size Christmas present _ a satellite carrying a bounty of space experiments begun nearly six years ago <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s five astronauts, scheduled to begin their 10-day flight Dec. 18, are charged with the task of retrieving what <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> calls the Long Duration Exposure Facility. The 11-ton, 30-foot-long payload carrying 57 experiments was placed in orbit during a 1984 shuttle mission. It was to be retrieved in a year, but that plan was scuttled due to schedule changes and the Challenger explosion in 1986 that killed all seven crew members. The craft is falling from orbit and is expected to crash back into the Earth's atmosphere in February if the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> astronauts do n't snatch it. `` We hope that even though we'll be gone from our families and loved ones for Christmas, that we'll be able to bring back a great big Christmas present,'' commander <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> said Tuesday. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivins </PERSON> and <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>. They spoke at a news conference and in interviews Tuesday at the Johnson Space Center. More than 200 scientists have been waiting years to see how their science, technology and materials experiments have fared during the long exposure to the space environment. Such information could be used to build a planned space station or other long-term spacecraft. `` The vehicle is invaluable to us,'' said the mission's flight director, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>. `` Almost every material known has been sitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen and other space materials for six years.'' <PERSON> Low </PERSON> said if the crew does n't snag the satellite, it will be a loss to science and a blow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prestige. The crew will attempt to retrieve the payload on the mission's fourth day. `` It's a completely passive satellite and no data has been transmitted to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Low </PERSON> said. `` So it's a complete loss of that mission if we do n't get it back.'' The chances of satellite chunks hitting anything on Earth are remote because it flies mostly over oceans, he said. `` But I think it's poor form to let something like that come back,'' <PERSON> Low </PERSON> said. The crew also will deploy a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite. To track down the old satellite, <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> will complete a complex set of maneuvers. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> is in charge of using a 60-foot robot arm to grab it and pull it into the cargo bay. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space. A secret <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission to be flown by a five-man Discovery crew is scheduled to lift off Nov. 22, the night before Thanksgiving.

 Rebels today tried to fan the flames of their 4-day-old offensive into a popular insurrection. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> called the insurgent push the act of `` a desperate beast.'' Both <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist administration and the Marxist-led <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed widespread popular support. More than 500 people have been reported killed and 1,000 wounded in the fighting. The government battled guerrillas holding poor districts on the capital's northern outskirts on Tuesday, the military's helicopter gunships pouring fire on at least one working-class neighborhood. Thousands of residents remained trapped in their homes by the heavy fighting and civilian casualties were high. The government declared a 24-hour curfew in seven northern neighborhoods where guerrilla fighters had dug in. Fighting was also reported in eastern provinces, to which travel is restricted. Rebel commander <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, speaking early today on the insurgents' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, said the guerrillas had declared more than a quarter of the Massachusetts-sized country `` liberated.'' She said revolutionary committees had been set up in dozens of towns. `` We call on the popular committees to give priority to the task of supporting the combatants ... to form militias, to construct workshops of popular armament, to collect food, medicine and bandages and organize the means of getting them to the combat zones,'' she said. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the offensive, begun Saturday night, `` has been a failure'' for the guerrillas. `` The harshest blow to them has been the repudiation of the people,'' he said in a speech broadcast nationwide Tuesday night. `` This -LRB- the offensive -RRB- is the act of a desperate beast.'' The combat, a state of siege, a dusk-to-dawn curfew and a guerrilla-imposed road transport ban made circulation difficult, at times impossible. These conditions hampered efforts to gauge the degree to which the general population was being swayed toward either side. The streets were deserted overnight for the third straight night. Red flares dropped by helicopters drifted over the <LOCATION> Mejicanos </LOCATION> neighborhood and tracer-laced bursts from the gunships' .30 - caliber machine guns sporadically blasted the working-class <PERSON> Mejicanos </PERSON> was one of several neighborhoods on the capital's periphery where insurgents were entrenched The fighting was been the fiercest since the rebels' `` final offensive'' of January 1981 failed to win them power. At least 500 people have been killed in the battle of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, with nearly double that number wounded, according to the military hospitals and morgue reports. A 10-year-old civil war between the rebels and a succession of U.S.-backed governments has claimed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians. Rebel leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they would not participate in peace talks scheduled for next week in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. They said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government was not negotiating seriously and blamed it for the Oct. 31 bombing of a union headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29. Two leftist political leaders who had been operating publicly since late 1987 took refuge in the Mexican and Venezuelan embassies. The leaders, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, have not asked for asylum, and are described by their hosts as `` guests.'' Many leaders of union, peasant and student organizations considered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone underground this week. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a rightist who took office June 1, said government forces had `` neutralized'' insurgents on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s southeastern, southern and western periphery, but that combat continued with dug-in rebels on the northern outskirts `` The army is advancing, but advancing slowly,'' he said. He accused the guerrillas of holding civilians `` hostage'' and of using them as `` screens'' against army counteroffensives. `` There is no danger whatever of the government being toppled,'' he said. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> denied air force planes and helicopters had bombarded civilian zones where the guerrillas are dug in. He acknowledged that rebel positions were strafed. Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>, minister of defense, said helicopters have fired rockets at guerrilla positions. Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 wounded in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since Saturday night, many reportedly casualties of air attacks. The New York-based human rights organization <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION> on Tuesday called on both the armed forces and the rebels to respect the articles of the Geneva Conventions obliging belligerents to take all measures possible to prevent civilian casualties. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said the local organization had appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to mediate a 72-hour truce between the government and the guerrilla command. He said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> agreed to try to arrange the measure, which would be used to evacuated wounded and civilians from combat zones.

 <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> `` Barnie'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, one of the original <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> yo-yo men who died at age 80, was remembered as a man with a smile on his face and a yo-yo in each hand. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> died Friday at a <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> hospital. A memorial service has not been scheduled. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>' uncle, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, popularized the toy in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during the Great Depression and set up an exhibition schedule with dozens of men traveling from town-to-town, telling stories and selling yo-yos. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Crump </PERSON>, editor of Yo-Yo Times, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based magazine for yo-yo enthusiasts, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> was one of the best. `` He was probably the most important link with the great yo-yo years,'' <PERSON> Crump </PERSON> said. `` He actually almost single-handedly created the yo-yo contest,'' a competition designed to increase yo-yo sales. `` I will remember him with a smile on his face and two yo-yos in his hands,'' said <PERSON> Crump </PERSON>, who last saw <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> last winter while in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to record music to yo-yo by. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> never married. He said in an interview last summer that a yo-yo man's life, like the toy, is up and down. `` I had a few girlfriends, but they did n't realize that if you do something like this 10 months a year, it gets tiring. I would travel 800 miles in a day just to get to a new market,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. `` If you get married, a woman thinks she would like that, like it was a two-week vacation. Not many would like it. Not for 50 years.'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> had surgery for prostate problems during the summer and fought lymphoma. He died in the hospital, but his brother, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, another yo-yo man who left the trade, said he believed <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> died of a weak heart. <PERSON> Barnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> did n't like calling the yo-yo a toy, saying it taught too many skills _ like eye-and-hand coordination and discipline. In his spiels, he used to give a history of the yo-yo, telling how ancient vases discovered in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> show wooden knobs suspended on strings. `` Go back before the birth of Christ and you can see how the string is tied on their fingers,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said.

 A young boy's screams as he was being carried from a movie theater led to the arrest of a man on charges he killed three other youngsters, police said. <PERSON> Westley </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, a 28-year-old <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> resident with a long history of sexual offenses involving children, was charged with three counts of first-degree aggravated murder in the deaths of three young Portland-Vancouver area boys, authorities said. Police said <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> was apprehended Monday night after he carried a 5-year-old boy from a theater restroom in <LOCATION> Camas </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. `` The boy started screaming, ` Help me! help me!''' said the theater's co-owner, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, `` and we took off running after the guy.'' The child was able to escape and was not injured. After getting a description of the man's car, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, the boyfriend of the boy's mother, found that it had broken down a few blocks away. <ORGANIZATION> Camas </ORGANIZATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> caught <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> after a little struggle. He returned <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> to the theater, where bystanders tied a belt around his hands and held him until police arrived. `` You have to admire this man,'' <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> said of Graves. Police also credited the boy for raising such a fuss as he was being carried away. `` The boy is a hero, I would say,'' <PERSON> Slyter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> is charged with killing 4-year-old <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Iseli </PERSON>, whose nude body was found just west of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> on Nov. 1, three days after he disappeared from a school playground in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. The boy had been strangled. Investigators declined to say whether he had been molested. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> also was charged with killing 10-year-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Neer </PERSON> and 11-year-old <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Neer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, who were stabbed to death on Labor Day in a park a few blocks from where <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> lived. At the time, investigators said there was no evidence the brothers had been molested. In addition, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> was charged with first-degree kidnapping in connection with Monday night's incident. Authorities said <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> had been convicted in 1987 of attempted unlawful imprisonment after admitting he fondled an 8-year-old boy in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Court records show he admitted to having a sexually deviant interest in young boys. He served about four months in jail and was sentenced to complete a program on sexual deviancy. In 1984, he was convicted of lewd contact with a minor in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. His 10-year jail sentence was commuted to not more than a year on the condition that he enter a psychiatric program. Police searched <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s studio apartment Tuesday. His landlady, <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shay </PERSON>, said he worked as a shipping clerk at a <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> paper company and had moved into the apartment about two months ago. `` The little I've talked with him, he's as nice a person as I've had in here in a long time,'' she said <PERSON> Shay </PERSON> said she had discussed the Neer slayings with <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>. `` He said he thought it was awful that those little boys got killed in the park,'' she said. `` He said he hoped they found the guy that did it.''

<TEXT>
 A lawyer who began kidney dialysis 18 years ago because he had good medical insurance and was considered a worthy risk for treatment eventually became a crusader for others less fortunate. But now 48-year-old <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> finds himself in need. On Tuesday, he was in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> awaiting a liver and kidney transplant, his only hope against liver cancer. But Medicare, the federal insurance program that pays medical costs for people with advanced kidney disease, excludes coverage of liver transplants. So after years of working on others' behalf, <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> has to raise money for himself. `` As ill as he is, and has been for years, he still has been responsible, almost single-handedly, for intervening with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prevent cuts from -LRB- kidney -RRB- programs,'' said <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> <PERSON> Moutsatsos </PERSON>, project director for the <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> has served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patients </ORGANIZATION> and was the first president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you were white, middle-class, married and insured, you got on dialysis. If not, you died,'' he said recently at his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> home, above the noise of a dialysis machine during one of his three weekly treatments. Dialysis gave <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> a chance at a full life. It has allowed him to watch two teen-age children grow and go on to college at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ithaca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He also has a daughter, 4, with his second wife, <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON>. Although Medicare usually pays for kidney transplants, the agency originally denied compensation to <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> because he needed a double transplant of his liver and kidneys. <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> conducted a tireless telephone campaign and enlisted the aid of political and medical allies to convince Medicare to pay about $ 80,000 for the kidney transplant. But rather than exult, <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> was enraged. `` It's outrageous,'' he said `` If it were n't for me and the people I know ... some poor shnook who did n't have connections would n't get this.'' But that was n't the only battle <PERSON> Feinsmith </PERSON> faced. He needed a $ 100,000 downpayment to be considered a liver transplant candidate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, where he was evaluated.

 Students and farmers demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food imports battled police with firebombs and rocks today in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other areas as protesters staged a running attack on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base. A small group of radical students demanding a ban on food imports hurled several firebombs and rocks at the main gate of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air base in <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>, about 130 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police said. Five students were arrested by South Korean police. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reported minor damage to a guardhouse, but no injuries. About 2,000 students and farmers hurling firebombs and rocks battled riot police at <ORGANIZATION> Konkuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after they were prevented from marching into the street to call for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government. Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets made repeated charges to drive the protesters back as armored police vans fired barrages of tear gas bombs. `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who enforce the opening of agricultural markets,'' protesters chanted. Police officials said more than 300 farmers and students were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for taking part in anti-government protests. The police said they had no information on injuries. Protesters gathered at <LOCATION> Konkuk </LOCATION> after the government deployed some 7,000 riot police to block a farmers' protest on <LOCATION> Yoido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> near the city center. Police banned the rally as a threat to law and order. Farmers' groups called the rally to demand an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and also seek an increase in prices for domestic farm products. The groups claim cheap <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports threaten to drive South Korean farmers out of business. Police blocked the rally after Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> ordered security forces Tuesday to launch a crackdown to block anti-government rallies by students, workers and farmers. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said farmers' groups held protests in other parts of the country, occupying government and political party offices. The agency said farmers fought police in at least a score of cities and towns, but gave no details. About 100 farmers occupied an opposition party office in <LOCATION> Naju </LOCATION> near the southern city <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> after police stopped them from leaving for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. Farmers also occupied a government headquarters in <LOCATION> Haenam </LOCATION>. Police checkpoints blocked farmers from entering <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to take part in the rally. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing for greater access to South Korean markets to help correct <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s $ 8 billion trade surplus with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The South Korean government is reluctant to open agricultural markets because of domestic political opposition. Radical students are supporting the farmers to try and expand anti-government forces. But the students have little support and are not seen as a serious threat to the government.

 Failure to follow regulations proved fatal for two police officers shot to death while driving a prisoner back to jail, authorities said. `` These two detectives got careless for a minute or two and it cost them their lives,'' Poice Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` If you make a mistake in this business, it can have terrible results.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> `` Stoney'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 25, was charged with killing the detectives and was arraigned Tuesday evening. He later pleaded innocent and was returned to <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail without bail. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> maintained that the officers were shot during a robbery by a gunman who freed him, said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was arrested late Monday at his girlfriend's home in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> after a 10-hour citywide hunt. He had been brought to a district attorney's office Monday to take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain, but a series of police mistakes allowed him to find a loaded gun in a police locker with a defective lock, authorities said. The errors began when <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was left alone in a detectives' squad room, authorities said Prisoners kept in the room are usually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers, but <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was left cuffed by just one hand to let him eat lunch, police said. The suspect either was n't searched or poorly searched before his return to jail, and he was alone in the back seat of the car, a violation of police policy, authorities said. Asked if the errors had killed the two decorated officers, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> replied, `` Yes.'' He announced a policy change that bans interrogating or holding prisoners in rooms with lockers. Killed were Detectives <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, 46, of <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>. Authorities said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> fired at least five shots from the stolen gun. Both officers were dead at the scene. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was arraigned on four counts of second-degree murder: one each for killing the detectives and two of felony murder, or murder in the furtherance of a crime _ escape, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> clerk. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> also was arraigned on the charges of first-degree escape and second-degree criminal weapon possession, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. The maximum penalty for murder in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is 25 years to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Detectives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it would set up a fund for their families. <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, a 20-year veteran, was married, with four children; <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an eight-year veteran, was married and had a daughter. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoer </PERSON>, a lawyer temporarily representing <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, asked the judge to appoint a public defender. <PERSON> Schoer </PERSON>'s law partner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sileo </PERSON>, is <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s lawyer in other criminal cases but said he had decided not to represent him in the detective killings, for reasons he would not discuss. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s record dates from 1980. In October, he and his mother were arrested on charges of conspiring to kill a witness against him in the July slaying of <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s girlfriend.

<TEXT>
 After 4-year-old <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> was seriously injured in a two-car accident two years ago, he sued the driver of the car in which he was riding _ his mom. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> won a $ 75,000 settlement of the lawsuit against his parents. He also won a $ 50,000 settlement against the driver of the second car. Both parties' insurance carriers will pay the boy the money. The case was tried last week in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and his mother, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON>, testified she was not speeding before the accident, as her son's lawsuit claimed. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, who is now 6, was placed in the unusual position of suing his parents over the accident because the court decided his mother was partly responsible for the crash, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Menkin </PERSON>. A jury had ruled <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> was 30 percent responsible for the accident, and the other driver, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, was 70 percent responsible. Because the court decided the mother was partially to blame, the boy had to sue both parties, <PERSON> Menkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, were pleased when the suit was settled with the $ 125,000 going to their son. `` We're happy about the result,'' said <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON>, who was named as a defendant because he owned the car. `` It's common for occupants of a vehicle to sue the driver. This just happened to be mother and son.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> suffered a broken leg, broken nose and broken back in the Jan. 5, 1987, accident. He spent nine days in a hospital and three months in a body cast, and has recovered from the injuries except for a fused spine, <PERSON> Menkin </PERSON> said.

 A fire that injured 31 people on the amphibious assault ship USS Inchon apparently was caused by a short circuit in an electrical compartment, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Twelve people were hospitalized; the others treated and released. The fire, which started about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and was extinguished in about 40 minutes, was one of a series of recent accidents that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> later in the day to order a 48-hour halt to all normal operations for a review of safety procedures. In the past three weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has experienced 10 serious accidents in which 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 53 have been injured. The recent series of accidents followed the April 19 explosion on the battleship USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in which 47 sailors died. The <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> fire broke out as the ship was in the <ORGANIZATION> Metroc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shipyard for routine repair work. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, said the blaze apparently was caused by a short circuit and that most of the damage was to electrical cables and insulation in the shore power compartment. There also was smoke and heat damage to the hangar deck. The compartment holds cables from the pier bringing electricity to the ship. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said 23 sailors and eight civilians were taken to area hospitals. The condition of the 12 admitted for smoke inhalation ranged from stable to serious, according to the hospitals. The 602-foot troop and helicopter carrier has a crew of 675 and can hold up to 2,000 Marines and 20 helicopters when on deployment. The <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> entered the shipyard Sept. 21 for a four-month overhaul.

 Thousands of people are expected to participate in a walk across the 8.5-mile <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which lost a 50-foot section in the Oct. 17 earthquake that tore through northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The walk Thursday over the Bay Bridge that links <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> will cost $ 5 and feature entertainers <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. It will be limited to 40,000 people. Some of the fees will go to quake relief, but the main purpose seemed to be to celebrate the bridge's scheduled Saturday reopening to traffic and the spirit of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents in dealing with the quake. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> hailed the cooperation that mended the bridge. `` Bureaucracy has been beaten,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday. `` It looks great,'' he said while flanked by the mayors of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> on the upper deck's newly installed concrete. He referred to the re-opening as Nov. 17, a month after the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that killed 66 people and caused $ 7 billion in damage, unaware that the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the day pushed the date to Nov. 18. Cars and other vehicles will start rolling across the bridge `` as soon as possible'' on Saturday, said <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachtold </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> district director who guided <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> during his brief visit to the 53-year-old bridge. Department officials said the delay was needed because two days of damp weather slowed work on the bridge.

 Identical twin brothers who have monopolized the mayor's office here for 42 years will continue their small-town dynasty following a 26-vote election victory. `` I'm surprised I did n't win by a greater majority, but a win is a win,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said Tuesday night after being re-elected to a four-year term. Unofficial returns showed that <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> received 1,185 votes to <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>'s 1,159. Mrs. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, a homemaker and former city employee making her first bid for political office, said she would decide today whether to seek a recount. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, who served on the <ORGANIZATION> Rutherford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a quarter-century and was a justice of the peace, was appointed interim mayor two years ago to replace his brother <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, who was ousted for misusing public money. The 70-year-old twins, born 30 minutes apart, are still close. They dress similarly, wear glasses and have gray, balding hair. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> is described by locals as `` the one with the hearing aid.'' It's little wonder, then, that townsfolk speculate that <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, who held the post for 40 years, still pulls the strings. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> became mayor in 1947 but was ousted after the courts found he misused $ 11,000 from the city's 1980 budget. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> does n't try to distance himself from his brother, referring to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> as his `` chief of staff.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> campaigned actively for <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>. The cozy relationship between the brothers was the main issue for Mrs. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>. `` It's still as crooked now as it was then,'' she said during the campaign. Mrs. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said the close vote scared the Ridleys. `` I think they will have even more people watching them now,'' she said. She had hammered on the theme that <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> needed a change in leadership, noting the town outside <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> had 500 people when <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> became mayor. Today, <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> is a growing city of 13,000, boasting a sprawling new plant where <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> produces light trucks and cars. <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> agrees the times are changing, but says he _ referrring to himself in the the plural _ has changed, too. `` We might have old age, but we have a young heart and a young mind,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> is denying farmers' allegations that it illegally manipulated soybean prices with an emergency order last summer The order led to a 20 percent drop in soybean prices along with corresponding declines in other commodities, and caused heavy financial losses among family farmers nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> says. The group, a lobbying organization that represents small farmers and rural business people in 34 states, and family farmers from leading soybean-producing states, filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit seeks more than $ 100 million in damages. The complaint stems from the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency action July 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures contracts. The board's move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an attempt to corner the market by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, an Italian company and one of the world's largest soybean processors. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s order was a bad faith and self-serving action initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant grain merchants and futures traders to create profits for their accounts and for their clients,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanner </PERSON>, AAM's president and an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> soybean farmer. <PERSON> Sanner </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel, accompanied by about 25 other farmers from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> _ many of whom said they had been devastated by the board action. `` I'm angry as hell about what has been done to us as producers of this nation,'' said <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a soybean farmer from <LOCATION> Brownville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has slapped <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soya </ORGANIZATION> unit with a $ 1,000-a-day fine for failing to provide documents the exchange says are needed for an investigation into the Italian company's actions. But a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soya </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company is cooperating with the investigation and has agreed to provide the documents _ rail contracts between the company and its shippers. The lawsuit filed Tuesday names as defendants the exchange, <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> and 21 other directors, along with five other exchange officials. After the news conference, the group _ carrying banners and buckets of soybeans _ marched five blocks to the Board of Trade. <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said officials were in meetings. He agreed to take the soybeans to exchange officials as a symbol of the complaint. In a news release, <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said exchange officials had not seen the lawsuit, but are `` confident in the action taken ... by the board of directors to maintain an orderly liquidation in our July 1989 soybean futures contract.'' He said board officials `` expect this lawsuit to be proven frivolous.''

<HEAD>Absentee Ballots Cast by Fax in Vermont Referendum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Age-old tradition met the information age as absentee ballots sent by fax to a couple on a trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were returned by an overnight delivery service in time to be counted. Resident <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> set up his facsimile machine Tuesday in the town clerk's office so absentee ballots in a school bond vote could be sent to his friends, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON>. `` This is certainly unique,'' said Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON> when he heard of the new way of distributing paper ballots. `` I do n't think this has ever happened in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> before. ... It's really kind of exciting.'' The Barnabys had gone to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on a business trip. Facsimile machines allow transmission of printed matter over telephone lines. But they do n't allow the for the sealed envelopes required for secret ballots, Town Clerk <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> explained. Residents were voting for the second time on a $ 1.05 million plan to expand the town elementary school. The measure passed narrowly in September. Opponents gathered enough signatures on a petition to call for another vote. <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> called him Monday to ask whether the fax was a legal way to distribute absentee ballots. `` I do n't think that the people who drafted the absentee ballot laws in the 18th century knew about fax machines,'' he said. But he said a fax would probably meet the legal definition of a mailed ballot, and consequently could be allowed.

<HEAD>Crackdown Continues against Sinhalese Extremists</HEAD>

 Troops raided a clandestine radio station and captured its operator in a dragnet that is decimating the leadership of an extremist group of Sinhalese nationalists, military officials said today. In addition, the bodies of 31 suspected Sinhalese extremists were discovered at daybreak in the central hills, the officials said. They blamed the killings on pro-government vigilante groups. The government's 2-year-old battle to subdue the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> took a dramatic turn Monday with the reported capture and killing of the group's senior leader, <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> According to a military source, the avowed Marxist `` sang like a bird'' about the whereabouts of his top lieutenants. In less than 18 hours, <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> and the front's No. 2 and No. 3 men were killed by security forces, according to government announcements. More than 6,000 people have been killed since August 1987 in violence associated with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s assassination campaign targeting governing officials and supporters The front professed outrage that the Sinhalese-dominated government made concessions to the Tamil minority, and its battle escalated into a challenge of the government's right to exist. The military officials said the raid on the front's clandestine radio station was carried out Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Boralesgamuwa </LOCATION>, six miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The front member in charge of the station, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, was captured and radio equipment worth $ 1.3 million seized, according to the officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. The short-wave radio station was called Voice of the Revolution. It broadcast three days a week, varying its hours to avoid jamming, and transmitted <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>'s speeches, revolutionary songs and allegations of government atrocities. The front, as well as human rights activists and opposition politicians, have long accused the government of fielding or tolerating death squads bent on wiping out the front. Some government officials have privately acknowledged that `` excesses'' may have occurred, but they usually blamed the killings of suspected front members on shadowy vigilante groups. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> claimed Tuesday that six of the front's seven Politburo members had been killed. But the military officials said today the Politburo had expanded to nine members, of whom seven were known to have been killed. Although killings blamed on the front have tapered off this week, it is too soon to say whether the front is finished or simply regrouping. The bodies of the suspected front members were found in two locations in the center of the island Wednesday. Twenty-three badly mutilated bodies were discovered in <LOCATION> Keppitipola </LOCATION>, about 65 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Eight more bodies were found in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The violence by the Sinhalese extremists erupted after the Sri Lankan government signed an Indian-sponsored peace accord on July 29, 1987, in an effort to end a Tamil insurrection that started in 1983. The accord spawned a Sinhalese backlash as members of the ethnic majority accused their government of making too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, are mostly Hindus and claim the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority discriminated against them in jobs and education. Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population, have dominated the government and military since <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, formerly called <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>, became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948.

 The jogger who was gang-raped and badly beaten in Central Park will spend Thanksgiving at home with her family, her father said. She was released Tuesday from a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> hospital after what doctors said was a remarkable recovery after being left for dead. Her father said he was `` thrilled to have her back,'' and was preparing a `` quiet Thanksgiving family celebration.'' In state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, the prosecution rested after four weeks of testimony in a hearing on whether statements six defendents gave police should be allowed as evidence at their upcoming rape and attempted murder trials. Defense lawyers maintain the statements, in which nearly all the youths implicate themselves or their co-defendants, were coerced and therefore illegal. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Gaylord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said the jogger would continue to be treated there on an outpatient basis. `` She continues to have post-traumatic amnesia,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Main </PERSON>, `` but she has made good recovery and rehabilitation.'' Head injuries often lead to post-traumatic amnesia, in which the victim can not remember what took place immediately before, during, and for some time after the injury. The jogger, a 29-year-old investment banker, was dragged 200 feet into the underbrush, raped, beaten with a pipe and a rock and left unconscious April 19. She had been on her nightly run. When police found her 3 -LCB- hours later, she was in a coma and had lost almost 80 percent of her blood. She had suffered brain contusions, two head fractures, broken facial bones and bruises from head to toe. She remained in critical condition at a hospital until May 1, when she raised her hand and appeared to raise her eyebrows as her name was called. She was walking a bit when she was moved June 7 to <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION>. By midsummer, she was reading novels, relearning basic math skills and calling colleagues at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bros. </LOCATION>, where she had worked before the attack. Main said the jogger and her family thanked the public and press for their support over the past seven months, saying it `` made a difference in her ability to recover.'' The family also thanked the news media for respecting her privacy and anonymity and stressed that the woman's continued recovery `` is highly dependent'' on these being maintained, Main said.

<HEAD>Carter: Sandinistas Trying to Smear Foes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the Sandinista government was attemptingm to unfairly tie <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civilian opposition coalition to the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who will lead an official team monitoring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Feb. 25 elections, said at a seminar Tuesday at his Presidential Center that he has complained privately to <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> representatives about a news article in the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, Barricada The publication attacked <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the newspaper `` has apparently published a totally fraudulent letter ostensibly written'' by <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> has tied the opposition coalition `` with the Contra military activity in a completely illegitimate fashion.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, speaking at the seminar, claimed that President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision to end a 19-month ceasefire in the war with the Contras was due to the tight race he faced for reelection against <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, the candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition that represents 12 of 21 registered Nicaraguan parties. A new, independent poll of Nicaraguan voters commissioned by a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> television station and released Tuesday showed <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> in a dead heat. The poll was taken in late October. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced two weeks ago he was canceling the ceasefire, citing increased attacks by Contras trying to disrupt the elections. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, however, cited Nicaraguan government figures showing that such attacks had decreased in October. When the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed last summer to advance the elections from November to February, he said, they did not think they would be seriously challenged. `` That equation has changed,'' he said. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> also accused the Sandinistas of forging documents that tied the opposition coalition to the Contras. He said the coalition has condemned violence from all sides. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON>, secretary-general of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s foreign ministry, said fair and free elections are an issue but so is sovereignty. `` Independence is a prerequisite of democracy. American policy fails to recognize the link between the democratic process and self-determination,'' he said. `` We are not running these elections to satisfy the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may `` have to live with a democratically elected government that is not of its liking.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he believes the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will honor the results and probably lift the 4-year-old trade embargo with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> no matter who wins if the independent observer groups report clean elections. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said his team will try to monitor voting at about 10 percent of the Nicaraguan polling places and compare the vote tallied there with the votes turned in to the central counting point. The former president led an official monitoring team at elections May 7 in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> denounced that election as fraudulent.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, concerned by Western powers' response to the democratic upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, urged them not to sour the new spirit of international cooperation by `` exporting capitalism'' to the region He made the comments six days after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embattled <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders let their citizens travel freely to the West and as Western countries appropriate hundreds of million of dollars in aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Other top Soviet officials joined their president in condemning any Western attempts to exploit the current instability in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and throwing cold water on calls for German reunification. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said he was surprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in the region as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet policy. `` This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' the Politburo member told a news conference today. `` We would like to have a common European house based on freedom. If someone interferes in that process, we might go back to the time of the Cold War. We are standing at such a juncture.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> issued his warning to the West in a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting Tuesday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` It is useless to clamor about victory in the Cold War, about the disintegration of some or other social system,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. `` Everything should be analyzed realistically and interests should be balanced.'' He then urged Western leaders not to practice their own form of socio-economic imperialism. `` When accusations of ` exporting revolutions' are replaced with calls for ` exporting capitalism,' we have at hand a dangerous manifestation of old thinking,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made the comments as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economics minister, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>, offered to rebuild <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy through broad-based investments and joint ventures and to overhaul the country's moribund communications and transport systems While not offering details, <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> said such aid would occur only if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> carried out a `` thorough change'' of its centrally planned economy. In a June 15 news conference in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared the Cold War over but did not take credit for ending it, as he now apparently is accusing the West of doing. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has called for negotiating an end to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as military alliances, turning them into purely political groups that cooperate more closely. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has called for cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's economic alliance. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated these groups should not be scrapped but rather transformed into bodies that foster stability. `` It is no time to destroy the established international political and economic institutions. Let them transform themselves with taking into account internal processes, let them find themselves a niche in the new situation and interact,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised the changes that have taken place in individual Eastern European countries without identifying them. In the past several months, dizzying changes have swept through the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling Communists ousted their longtime leader, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, last month and on Thursday opened their borders in an effort to win credibility with a people demanding free elections and an end to the Communist monopoly on power. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on Tuesday granted its citizens free travel abroad. On Friday, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> replaced its longtime Communist leader, <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. In August, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> became the first East bloc nation with a government not led by Communists. Last month, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Communists changed the name of their party to the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and endorsed a transition to parliamentary democracy, promising free elections by June. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and his French counterpart clashed Tuesday over whether reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is desireable.

 A study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> indicates stress can worsen skin diseases, giving credence to a theory long held by doctors, according to a researcher. The study, scheduled for publication today in the journal Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, shows nerve fibers in the skin release a protein that triggers inflammation, such as in psoriasis or acne. `` There is now some evidence to show that, at least in the skin, the immune response is controlled to some extent by state of mind and emotional status,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the study's lead author. `` For dermatologists, this is remarkably significant because of the observation that has been held for hundreds of years that anxiety and stress can provoke itching or cause worsening of skin diseases.'' Other scientists cautioned that other dermatological research showed different factors also could trigger the response. They called <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s claims of a stress-immunity link premature. The Penn researchers, in studing a series of live skin samples, found that the protein, called substance P, is released by tiny nerve fibers in the skin that lie near mast cells. As substance P bathes the mast cells, it causes them to release granules, which secrete a substance that leaks into blood vessels, according to the study. The walls of the blood vessel become sticky and white blood cells begin to accummulate, inflamming the skin, the <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> study said. Previously, researchers believed the loss of granules from the mast cells occurred after inflammation, which current treatments try to suppress. Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintroub </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> called the mast cell conclusion a `` reasonable hypothesis.'' But he hesitated to agree that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s research proves a stress-immunity link. Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorincz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said a variety of substances can stimulate the loss of granules from mast cells. Earlier research showed that even when the release of substance P is blocked, some signs of inflammation occur, <PERSON> Lorincz </PERSON> said. `` I have no doubt that substance P is involved -LRB- in inflammation -RRB-, but whether it's a universal key, I would say no,'' <PERSON> Lorencz </PERSON> said. The Penn researchers, while using skin as a model, said the study's results could lead to new forms of treatment for inflammation in other organs, such as the lungs.

 Of the millions of East Germans who rushed to the West when travel barriers were lifted, one man really hit the jackpot. The 40-year-old mechanic, identified only as <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, arrived Friday just in time to buy a ticket for the Lower <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> state lottery, the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. On Saturday night, he learned he won 1.2 million marks -LRB- $ 650,000 -RRB-. `` I saw the numbers drawn on television and knew I had all six,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> as saying. Lottery drawings are broadcast regularly on Saturday evening television in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> contacted the state lottery office on Monday by telephone and asked what he had won, <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You have won 1.2 million marks,'' he was told. `` What can I buy with it?'' he asked. `` A Mercedes, a house, and the rest I can put in the bank for you and you'll draw 5,000 marks -LRB- $ 2,700 -RRB- a month in interest after taxes,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted the lottery official as responding.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conceded for the first time that the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle that nearly carried him to the White House is no more. But the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president said Tuesday that the formula that produced a white-hot economy in the early 1980s can bring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> back from the brink of recession. `` The miracle of the'80s may be over, but the fundamental strengths that made it happen are still here _ daring entrepreneurs and productive workers, great universities and great hospitals,'' the governor said. `` I do n't plan to spend the next 14 months ... debating whether or not we're in a recession. I plan to spend that time laying the foundation we will need to make the 1990s every bit as good or better than the'80s.'' Declining revenue has left the state with a $ 720 million budget deficit and budget cuts are threatening already strapped social, construction and educational programs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' comments came in an address at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in which he outlined his blueprint for economic success in the 1990s. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he will leave office when his term is up after 1990.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> today made a final stride toward full civilian rule as voters cast ballots in the country's first popular presidential election in nearly three decades The vote, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Brazilian Republic, follows two decades of rapid economic development in spite of massive foreign debt and widespread poverty. The favorite is a conservative former state governor, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but he is not expected to win enough votes to avoid a runoff with one of two top two leftist candidates. Early reports indicated voting was peaceful across the country. In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, voters waited good-humoredly in huge lines that snaked around city blocks, despite a threat of rain. Many voted early to take advantage of the national holiday, which marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of a republic that overthrew Emperor <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> II. Brazilians lined up to vote hours before the polls opened at 8 a.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EST -RRB-. Polls were to close at 5 p.m., with partial results expected at around 9 p.m.. An official projection of the winner was due Saturday <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s attacks on President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> for 1,300 percent annual inflation and widespread corruption have struck a chord with many of the 82 million registered voters, most of whom earn less than $ 36 a week. In a national TV address Tuesday night, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> called the election `` an extraordinary spectacle'' that demonstrated `` the flourishing of Brazilian democracy.'' `` The democratic transition is complete,'' said <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who was chosen in 1985 by an electoral college after the military ended 21 years of rule. `` God has won in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' Fighting for second place are two leftists _ ex-governor <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, who pledges West European-style socialism, and Rep. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a former factory worker and strike leader who wants a `` workers' republic,'' with nationalized banks and cancellation of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 110 billion foreign debt. If no candidate wins a majority _ and it's doubtful anyone will _ the top two vote-getters will meet in a runoff Dec. 17. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> had a comfortable lead, but far short of a majority in the 21-candidate field, according to two opinion polls announced Tuesday. Many voters wore red bandanas, the symbol of <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, who was about even with <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> in voter surveys. But in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, election officials made <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> sympathizers take off the bandanas to vote. Other than <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> or <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>, only two other candidates were given any chance of squeaking into the No. 2 spot: center-leftist Sen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Covas </PERSON>, and rightist Rep. <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON>. The two-month campaign has been marred by some personal insults, but enthusiastic crowds have gathered at street rallies across this nation of 150 million people, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a television personality, tried to enter the race at the last minute, but officials ruled he had violated election rules. Paper ballots with squares beside each candidate's name were waiting at 250,000 polling stations, from the southern plains to the remote jungle villages in the northwestern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> region. Special stations were set up for the blind and for the estimated half-million people with leprosy. In some places, voting equipment had to be carried in by canoe or on mules. Federal troops were stationed in 39 of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 4,445 counties _ mostly in the remote north and northwest _ to keep order and to prevent last-minute campaigning. Brazilians under 47 _ nearly 73 percent of the electorate _ have never voted for president. In the last election in 1960, <PERSON> Janio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quadros </PERSON> won, but he stunned the nation by saying he was plagued by `` occult forces'' and resigned after seven months in office. His vice president, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulart </PERSON>, took over but was ousted in a military coup in 1964. The military regime banned direct voting for president but it was restored by a new constitution enacted last year. Voting is mandatory for everyone between age 18 and 69. And for the first time in the country's history, 16 - and 17-year-olds may vote, though it's not mandatory Some 3.3 million _ more than half of those eligible _ have registered. The election comes a century after republicans in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> overthrew <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only independent monarchy.

The ban, fiercely opposed by the trucking industry, would reduce rush-hour truck traffic on city streets by 70 percent. Exempted would be grocery delivery trucks, trucks carrying cargo from the harbor and trucks making deliveries of seasonal produce _ with Christmas trees and watermelons specifically mentioned. Trucks delivering liquor would not be affected because they are regulated by the state.

<HEAD>Report: State of Emergency in South Africa May Be Lifted in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government may lift the state of emergency and free jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to coincide with the opening of Parliament on Feb. 2, a newspaper said today. Business Day said Cabinet members `` are prepared to concede in private'' that the two steps are essential if President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is to succeed with his proposals to negotiate some form of black-white power-sharing. The newspaper, which generally reflects the views of liberal business leaders, said senior government officials `` have accepted the state of emergency is an obstacle to getting negotiations started and are pressing for it to be lifted.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, whom many blacks regard as their paramount leader, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for planning an anti-government sabotage campaign on behalf of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. The state of emergency was declared in June 1986. Emergency regulations allow police to detain people indefinitely without trial, outlaw certain forms of protest, and subject the news media to various restrictions. Last month, the government unconditionally freed seven <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders, five of them co-defendants of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Their freedom to speak out, even at mass rallies, was been widely viewed as a move by the government to begin dismantling the emergency. In a related development, the official magazine of the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ to which most government officials belong _ called on <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to consider reprieving political prisoners on Death Row. Several <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas convicted on terrorism charges are among the more than 200 prisoners currently facing execution. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release has been demanded by a wide range of black leaders as a precondition for accepting the government's invitation to negotiate a new political system. Last weekend, however, one of the most powerful moderate black groups, the Zulu political organization <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, announced that it was prepared to open talks with the government immediately. Inkatha's leader, <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, in the past had been among those demanding <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release, but he has expressed annoyance at the freed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders for remarks which he perceives as suggesting the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the sole legitimate voice of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s blacks <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who took office in August, has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five years that extends some form of political rights to the black majority while providing whites with some form of veto power. Inkatha, in a concession likely to anger the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, said it was willing to negotiate a new system that stopped short of one-person, one-vote.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories rose 0.2 percent in September, while business sales dropped 0.3 percent, the government reported today. The combination of the accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots rising faster than sales could be bad news for the economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories climbed to a seasonally adjusted $ 791.8 billion in September, following a gain of 0.4 percent in August. Business sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted $ 524.6 billion after advancing 3 percent in August. The September business activity produced an increase in the ratio of sales to 1.51, meaning it would take 1.51 months to exhaust inventories at the September pace. The ratio was 1.50 in August. Retailer backlogs were up 1 percent in September and could be worse in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported on Tuesday that retail sales last month dropped a full 1 percent that included a 5.1 percent decline in car sales. On the other hand, manufacturers inventories, which represent about 45 percent of the total, slipped 0.1 percent and wholesale backlogs dropped 0.3 percent. Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, fell 1.6 percent in September. Retailers' and wholesalers' sales both were up 0.7 percent. Overall inventories were 6.4 percent above those of a year ago. Sales increased 6.7 percent over September 1988.

 Soldiers ordered at least 350,000 Palestinians not to leave their homes in the occupied lands today, the first anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of a Palestinian state. But festivities were held in several towns and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in which youths shot off fireworks, danced in the streets and carried balloons painted with the colors of the Palestinian national flag. Violent protests occurred in at least five towns where soldiers fired live ammunition and rubber bullets, injuring 10 people during stone-throwing demonstrations, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Police said they arrested seven stone-throwers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police also fired tear gas to disperse a protest march by 200 doctors and nurses from two hospitals in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after rocks were hurled at the troops from behind fences, a spokesman said. No injuries were reported. Troops were under orders to respond firmly to any violence and were warned that uprising activists had received orders to increase the use of firearms following the fatal shooting Monday of a soldier in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told legislators Tuesday that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists had received secret orders from uprising leaders to attack Israelis with firearms, rather than stones or firebombs, newspapers reported. The day marks one year since the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile proclaimed statehood in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which have been under Israeli military occupation since the 1967 Middle East War. About 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied territories. The Israeli government has ignored the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration and refused negotiations with the organization, which it calls terrorist. Since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began 23 months ago, 615 Palestinians and 41 Israelis have been killed. Palestinians launched celebrations of the holiday Tuesday night, setting off fireworks in some towns, where women also danced in streets. In <LOCATION> Tilat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Al-Haritiya </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, children gathered on the streets Tuesday night singing nationalist songs and draping displaying photographs of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> across electricity poles. The army today curtailed festivities by imposing curfews in more than 20 towns, villages, refugee camps and cities throughout the disputed lands. At least 350,000 Palestinians were affected. Soldiers also blocked transport in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for a second straight day. Two Palestinians were shot and wounded during stone-throwing protests in <LOCATION> Nozeirat </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Also today, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeper in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> shot and killed an Israeli-allied militiaman and wounded another who tried to force their car through a roadblock and clashed with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops, officials said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, jumping the gun on anniversary report cards, is already declaring `` a successful first year'' after just 10 months in office. But his assessment of his own performance misses a few mileposts. For instance, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Monday to appear at two Republican fund-raisers, it will be the 30th state he has visited since his inauguration in January. And when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> for his Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it will be the 14th foreign nation he will have visited as president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vetoed five bills _ and has not yet been overridden by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. By the same token, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has received few legislative victories. Of the nearly two dozen major proposals he has sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, only one _ legislation to rescue the ailing savings and loan industry _ has been enacted. Some 119 of his nominations remain in limbo in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And he was the first president in recent times to have a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> nominee _ <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> as </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary _ rejected by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The president has given what the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> considers 27 `` formal news conferences.'' White House pet spaniel <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, in her first 10 months as first pup, has killed six squirrels, two rats and one pigeon on the White House grounds, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently confided to several reporters during one of his frequent jogs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took 15 days in August to catch one fish. The president has spent only six weekends at the White House since taking office. And, while he has made six trips this year to his family compound at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, he spends most weekends at the presidential retreat at Camp David. He spends so much time at the retreat in the <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, in fact, that he told a recent audience `` my son <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> has started a modest lobbying campaign for me to change the name to Camp <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>.'' He observed that former President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> named the retreat after his grandson, <PERSON> David </PERSON>. But, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, since he himself had four sons, one daughter and 11 grandchildren, picking a new name might touch off a fierce inter-family competition. In off-year general and special election races, he made campaign appearances for six Republican candidates. His batting average _ two won, four lost. He claims he gets up to 60,000 letters a week `` from children to our oldest citizens.'' Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> recently suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ who himself dashes off thank-you notes and letters throughout each day _ has generated and received more correspondence than any president in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history at an equivalent point in his term. In 10 months in office, in fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been responsible for more correspondence than some presidents generated in their entire administrations, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently breaks his own self-imposed rule about answering reporters' questions at picture-taking sessions. In fact, he violated it twice on Tuesday _ answering questions on the easing of travel restrictions in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in the morning and on <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> arms shipments to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the afternoon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also continues to stick to his own versions of some places' and people's names _ often talking about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nation of `` The <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' and referring to Polish Solidarity Leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first name as `` Lock. Asked on Tuesday why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> always called <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, his dinner guest at the White House Tuesday night, `` Lock,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as vice president in 1987, `` someone in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> told him that the correct pronunciation ... was ` lock.' And he has used it ever since.'' Of course, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> has some trouble with last names himself. The other day, he turned red-faced after beginning a briefing by referring to the nation's 41st chief executive as `` President Mush.''

 The trial of a Hispanic policeman in the slaying of a black motorcyclist opened today with the prosecution arguing that the officer was in no danger and did not have to fire the shot that set off three days of riots. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> cleared the way Tuesday for the manslaughter trial of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> by refusing to move the case out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He rejected defense arguments that the threat of violence hung over the trial and could frighten jurors into convicting <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> to avoid another riot. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told the racially mixed jury, seated after three weeks of questioning, that the 31-year-old officer failed to act as a prudent policeman should have in the slaying of <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION>, 23. `` It was not a life-or-death situation. It was not a split-second decision, and he did not have to shoot,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> in the head after taking two steps into the street and putting himself closer to the path of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> speeding motorcycle, which was being chased by a patrol car Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, in his opening arguments, said the shooting `` had nothing to do with race.'' `` Officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> did not shoot his gun because he's a Hispanic. <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was not shot because he is black,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. But within moments, he said, `` race had everything to do with this case'' as a crowd formed in a prelude to a night of rioting. The Jan. 16 shooting, which also led to the death of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> passenger, exploded into three days of rioting One looter was shot to death, 11 people were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down. Some black leaders said the jury's ethnic mixture _ two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic whites _ could head off a repeat of rioting that followed acquittals by all-white juries in 1980 and 1984 of two other officers who had killed blacks. `` The fact that the jury resembles the tri-ethnic balance of this community goes a long way to reducing that level of tension,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s Community Relations Board. A televised forum Tuesday night in the predominantly black <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood where the shooting occurred illustrated the community's continuing anger, as many participants complained that they were mistreated by Hispanics who arrived in this country only recently. The anger led the defense to enter into the record scores of items showing that more violence was expected if <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was acquitted. The exhibits included violence-threatening posters by the `` Overtown Comrades,'' and documents showing police contingency plans to combat a riot if <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is found innocent. Decisions by the judge have sharply limited how much the defense can reveal to jurors about the slain motorcyclist's police record and allegations that he was picking up drug profits the night of the killing. `` We have to start out with the the court already excluding 75 percent of our defense,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Needless to say, we're operating under a great handicap.'' The shooting took place during the week of the Super Bowl in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Colombian-born <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and his partner were on an <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> street, talking to the victim of a minor crime. As they talked, another squad car was chasing down a speeding motorcycle driven by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and carrying his friend <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. When the motorcycle turned onto the street where <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was standing, the officer fired one shot, killing <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing into a car. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died later. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was charged with two counts of manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, he would face a maximum penalty of 60 years imprisonment. Within an hour after the shooting, a mob gathered at the scene and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles, starting the rioting. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was found to have high levels of alcohol and THC _ the active chemical in marijuana _ in his blood at the time of his death. He also had 5.5 grams of marijuana and $ 1,500 in his pocket, facts the defense contends showed he was a drug dealer desperate enough to run down a policeman to avoid arrest. The city later set up a commission to examine the roots of the racial disturbance, the fourth to hit <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the 1980s. The first occurred in 1980 after an all-white jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> acquitted a group of <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> policemen in the fatal beating of black insurance executive <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON>. The case was moved to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity. In 1982, a riot broke out when <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> entered an <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> video arcade and shot and killed <PERSON> Nevell </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a black. Two years later, violence broke out again when an all-white jury acquitted <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> of manslaughter.

<HEAD>Draft Laws on Civil Rights Under Review in Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government panel has proposed revising laws on assembly and association to comply with international human rights accords without discarding traditional Communist principles, an official said today. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> submitted the three draft laws to Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who on Tuesday announced that Czechoslovaks wishing to travel to the West will no longer need exit visas, beginning Jan. 1. Despite some easing of restrictions, however, the hard-line government continued to crack down on dissent. A court in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> on Tuesday sentenced an activist who urged his countrymen to honor those killed in the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zbynek </PERSON> <PERSON> Vokrouhlicky </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that worked out the draft laws, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they will go to a legislative commission before being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, probably in the spring. The Communist Party organ Rude Pravo on Tuesday said the committee submitted the drafts to <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> on Nov. 1O. Copies of the drafts could not be obtained immediately, and there were few details on their contents. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is rewriting its laws to conform with human rights commitments signed at a 35-nation conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> early this year. Those accords commit the signatory nations to allow freer travel and guarantee human rights. It was not immediately clear if the laws under discussion will translate into more freedoms for the country's population. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said the easing of travel, which has been introduced gradually over the past two years, was designed to reduce bureaucracy and contribute to the `` satisfaction of its citizens.'' Czechoslovaks have been allowed to travel more freely than their counterparts in other hard-line Communist countries, and Western analysts said the new rules will not have a marked effect on who will be allowed to travel. People wishing to travel west still must apply for visas from the country of destination and must prove they have sufficent hard currency to cover travel expenses. Analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no indication that political activists, many of whom have had their passports confiscated, would be allowed to travel under the new regulations. In <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, a court sentenced activist <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON> to an eight-month suspended sentence after a two-day trial and acquitted three others who signed a statement urged Slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1968 invasion. The court refused the defendants' request to be tried together with a fifth activist, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, whose case goes to trial separately next week. He could face up to 10 years in jail.

<TEXT>
 The telephone company in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is free to pull the plug on live dial-a-porn services after today, a federal judge ruled in a free-speech case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurn </PERSON> on Tuesday refused to block <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from barring two-way conversations on its 970 exchange. The exchange, available only in four area codes around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, allows callers to participate in sexually explicit conversations as well as hear taped messages. Companies that operate such services set fees of $ 3 per minute or more that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telephone </LOCATION> is responsible for collecting. The phone company was taken to court by dial-a-porn providers when it refused to continue billing. The services won a temporary order from a state court in September that allowed the services to continue, and then brought the matter to federal court as a fight over freedom of speech. <PERSON> McCurn </PERSON> ruled that the services had not proved the case was a First Amendment issue, but he also refused to throw out the case, leaving open the possibility the vendors can seek court relief on other grounds. Two-way dial-a-porn services provided by five companies will cease at the end of the business day today, said their lawyer, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dichter </PERSON>. But he said he would file a motion as soon as possible to allow the services to resume. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the case was never a fight over freedom of speech. He said the phone company has no power to regulate the content of taped messages or live conversations. `` No one is prohibiting them from speaking. If people want to spend 50 minutes on the phone with <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> or 30 minutes with <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON>, they have the right and the companies have the right to provide that service,'' said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` But we're not going to do the billing and collecting. With this kind of thing, it's easy to see people getting carried away and then not wanting to pay the bill when it comes due.''

<TEXT>
 About 5,000 judges and 12,000 court workers ended a two-week strike today after the government agreed to give them bulletproof vests, bodyguards and reinforced cars to protect them from drug traffickers. The strike, which shut down <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judicial system, ended as a result of a meeting Tuesday with the minister of justice, said <PERSON> Consuleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> also promised that judges' offices will be moved to government buildings offering better security, Mrs. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> The government also will study the possibility of salary increases for judges dealing with drug trafficking cases, Mrs. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. Judges are paid an average of about $ 400 a month. The government will start providing the bulletproof vests, bodyguards and bullet-resistant cars next week, she said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said today the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had donated 300 bulletproof vests, 12 bullet-resistant cars, 12 metal detectors and $ 500,000 for buying other security equipment. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sent a Hercules cargo plane loaded with weapons, munitions and security equipment for the judges, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mery </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castello </PERSON>, said she was unable to confirm or deny the report. The strike was declared after a federal judge was shot and killed in the drug trafficking center of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The judge was the third killed in three months. Although no one claimed responsbility for the killings, government security forces and the judges' union blamed drug traffickers. The government declared war on the traffickers after they killed a popular presidential candidate, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, on Aug. 18. The traffickers then began a wave of bombings and assassinations and threatened reprisals for any traffickers extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There have been 253 attacks attrributed to drug traffickers, with 39 people killed.

<TEXT>
 A quarrel between two brothers touched off street battles between rival Shiite Moslem militiamen loyal to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, killing one combatant and wounding three, police said today. In a separate development, the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, threatened to cut the throats and tongues of moderate Christian leaders who support an Arab-brokered peace plan to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. His threat appeared aimed at blocking moderates in the Christian heartland he controls from joining a national reconciliation Cabinet under premier-designate <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. Police said the brothers' quarrel began after <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, a senior leader of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, went to visit his ailing mother at the sprawling <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district at nightfall Tuesday. He was stopped by gunmen guarding the house under his younger brother, who goes by the nom de guerre of Abul-Rou' b, or father of horror, and commands <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fighters of the pro-Syrian Amal militia, according to police. <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>'s bodyguards fired in the air to clear way for the sheik. His brother shouted orders to his men from the mother's bedside to shoot back and `` all hell broke loose,'' said a police spokemsan Fighting quickly engulfed the entire <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district and then spread to Bir el-Abed and <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> neighborhoods as <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>'s motorcade raced back under gunfire to Hezbollah-controlled territory, said the spokesman. He said the command of a Syrian army contingent in charge of security of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector intervened with the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to curb the flare-up. It tapered off briefly but picked up again at midnight, when militiamen of the two factions shot at each other with machine guns, 106mm jeep-mounted recoiless guns and rocket-propelled grenades until dawn, the spokesman said. He said Syrian troops patrolled <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON> and other Shiite slums this morning to prevent a new outbreak of violence. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and secular <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> have long been fighting for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the largest single sect among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million population. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s threat was reported in a statement released by his press office in the shell-battered presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, five miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Those who support the Arab solution deserve to have their throats and tongues cut,'' the 54-year-old Maronite general said. `` We are not going to be lenient with them.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> appeared to be responding to a statement by <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Harb </PERSON>, who publicly ridiculed the `` war of liberation'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared in March to drive <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harb </PERSON> represents the independent Maronite bloc, which has 14 deputies in the Lebanese Parliament that approved the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peace plan forged at a special session in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which shifts power to the Moslem majority. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads an interim military Cabinet, rejected the accord, demanding a timetable for a total Syrian withdrawal

 A judge today permanently barred the release of a <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> album that the former Beatle considers an embarassment recorded while he was on drugs and alcohol. The action by Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was revealed as the trial began on two remaining issues _ a dispute over whether <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> owes <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, producer Chips Moman $ 146,239 in expenses for making the 1987 record, and whether <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> has the rights to future recordings by <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> gave no reason for making permanent another judge's temporary order keeping the record under wraps The suit against <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> and College Park-based <ORGANIZATION> CRS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> contends that the results of the 1987 recording sessions are substandard and would be a professional embarrassment to <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, who concedes he was then addicted to alcohol. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the first witness to testify today, said he went to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> in February 1987 to work with <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> on an album, thinking that there was no formal contract between them. `` We felt some agreement would be reached but it always hinged on if the album was a hit,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> testified. The drummer and singer said he paid his own expenses and believed <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> was not charging for studio time. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in opening arguments that <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> would never have agreed to work with <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> without a contractual agreement. `` If there is anyone in this room who knows what they're doing regarding the music industry, it's Chips Moman,'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s appearance in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> drew a stream of courthouse employees seeking a glimpse of the former Beatle. He drew laughs when he took the stand and jokingly said into the microphone, `` Is it on? Or are we rolling, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> has claimed that he and other musicians at the recording dates were often drunk and sometimes high on marijuana. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> recently underwent treatment for his addiction and embarked on a well-received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concert tour during the summer. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>'s lawyers have argued that the recordings in question are of good quality, and they cited the producer's reputation, including work with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> has testified that he did not allow liquor in his studio. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said his client rejected an offer of $ 100,000 from <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> to kill the album; he said in August that the album could make $ 3.5 million.

<HEAD>Hispanic Grand Jurors Quit to Protest Lack of Indictment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO CITY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five Hispanics quit a grand jury to protest what they said was a `` railroad job'' by prosecutors to help a former policeman avoid trial in the shooting death of a Mexican-American rape suspect. District Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Conard </PERSON> said Tuesday he expects the grand jurors to return when their session resumes Friday. `` They took an oath to do a duty,'' he said. The grand jury was the second in this town of 5,500 to refuse to indict the former part-time policeman, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, in the 1988 slaying of <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. A grand jury cleared <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> a week after the shooting. After pressure from Hispanic leaders and state and federal officials, a grand jury reviewed the case again but did not have the nine votes to indict. `` We are resigning because we can not be party to this railroad job performed by the state and district attorney's office,'' the five grand jurors said in a statement Tuesday. `` We are willing to risk the consequences, whatever they may be.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, one of those who resigned, said the proceedings were unfair, but he declined to elaborate. `` I'm just too upset about it,'' she said. `` Maybe later, when I've gotten over it.'' The district attorney said there is no provision in the law for grand jurors to resign. `` It's kind of like being drafted _ you get selected and serve that term of court,'' he said. The 12-member grand jury's term ends in February. District Judge <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> was researching the law to determine if the grand jurors are in contempt of court, district clerk <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said. The League of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> has said the case is a watershed in Mexican-Americans' struggle for equal treatment in the smaller cities of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They have said they want <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> tried for civil-rights violations in federal court because they perceive bias in the state justice systems. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> told officials he was trying to arrest <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> when <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> lunged at him with a knife. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said he shot <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> in self-defense, and local investigators agreed. But an autopsy that <ORGANIZATION> LULAC </ORGANIZATION> hired an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> medical examiner to perform concluded from the the wounds and bullet trajectories that <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> had his hands above his head. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was shot in the side of the chest, in the back below the shoulder blade and in the back of the head.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's nominee to head nuclear weapons production told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today controversy over his selection was rooted mainly in popular opposition to nuclear power. Referring to his 23 years of service in regulating commercial nuclear power, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said, `` Nuclear power is an inherently controversial subject and all decisions are subject to criticism from one source or another.'' At the start of his confirmation hearing, which is expected to last at least three days, <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> his opponents also were motivated by a dislike of his management style. `` I say what I think ... I'm aggressive, I'm not a diplomat ... I can be abrasive,'' Stello said. The hearing opened on a note of confusion, with Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the panel chairman, announcing that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not yet provided letters, reports and other materials on Stello requested several weeks ago Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, questioned whether the hearing should go ahead since the missing materials might be important to members questioning Stello's credentials. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> raised a series of questions about Stello's suitability for the job, and Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> said in opening statements that they would vote against <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s nomination. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also are expected to oppose Stello. Republican members <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> told Stello they would support his nomination. The committee has 20 members. In an unusual move, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> personally introduced Stello to the committee and pleaded for his confirmation to a post he called `` one of the toughest'' in the federal government. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> called Stello `` the right person for this job, an individual whose tough yet reasoned style meets my requirements.'' To bolster his chances for committee approval, Stello this week sent panel members a massive volume of his rebuttals to charges that he is unqualified for the job and ill-suited to restore public trust in the safety of operations at the weapons complex, which includes 17 major defense facilities in 12 states. Stello's report was not made public. Even if the committee voted to recommend confirmation, it appeared highly unlikely the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would vote on the nomination before its holiday recess next week. In a move interpreted by some as a sign that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> doubted <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s chances of winning <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> late last month told a top aide to take charge of the weapons office pending the outcome of the Stello debate. Representatives of the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, which has led a national campaign against <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s nomination, said Tuesday they were disappointed the committee did not accept the group's request to testify at today's hearing. `` If ever a nominee called for a thorough review process this is it,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> joined four other senators not on the committee in urging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to withdraw the nomination, which <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had predicted would be controversial before it was announced in July. The letter said the poor condition of the weapons facilities, coupled with declining public trust in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to safely operate the plants, made it imperative that the credentials of the weapons production chief be unassailable `` Even if confirmed, the controversy surrounding Mr. <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> would critically impair his ability to address the management failures of past administrations which have reduced our nuclear weapons production program to a shambles,'' the letter said. The five senators cited a record by <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> of `` circumventing health and safety regulations and obstructing investigations'' while serving at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> and Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The controversy surrounding Stello comes from his more than 20 years of work at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates commercial nuclear power, and the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the predecessor of both the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The most recent incident, which sparked a congressional investigation of Stello's conduct in 1987, involved unorthodox procedures he used as <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff in approving cash payments to obtain information from a former utility employee.

 East German newspapers today appeared to dismiss <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s offer of massive financial aid, and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cautioned that `` exporting capitalism'' could hurt the climate of cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Also today, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency said nearly half its 16.5 million people have been issued visas for the West since travel restrictions were lifted on Thursday. ADN quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying 7,765,881 visas for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had been approved by this morning. Economist <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can manage its own economic recovery, an indication that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s conditional aid offer may be rejected. `` I do n't see any need to dramatize the internal or external financial situation'' of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying. The government newspaper Bauern-Echo, aimed at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s farmers, warned of becoming too greatly influenced by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout,'' the paper declared. `` Yes to meeting again, no to reunification. The two German states are politically and economically too diverse.'' There was no official response from the government to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s offer, which would require Easter <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling Communists to fundamentally reform their centrally planned economy. Communist officials have made clear they do not favor a full free-market system. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s third-largest bank said it would seek to open an office in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION>, however, requires the approval of authorities in both Germanys and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, believed to have encouraged the ouster of hard-line East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and the dizzying reforms that led to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall's opening, warned Westerners not to gloat over the demise of Communism in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. `` When accusations of ` exporting revolutions' are replaced with calls for ` exporting capitalism,' we have at hand a dangerous manifestation of old thinking,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Even leaders of New Forum, the East German opposition group leading massive protest marches for democratic change, have expressed concern that Western capitalists might exploit an unstable <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> without helping its people. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said outsiders should not interfere with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic reforms. `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> needs no patronage. The society of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is strong enough to improve its economic performance,'' he said. `` The citizens want self-determination and do not want to exchange the decades of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> tutelage for the patronage of the West German state or society.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economics minister, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>, offered Tuesday to rebuild <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy through broad-based investments and joint ventures and to overhaul it moribund communications and transport systems. While not offering details, <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> likened his plan to the brainchild of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> that revitalized postwar <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with an infusion of $ 12 billion. But he said such aid would be made available only if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> carried out a `` thorough change'' of its centrally planned economy. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new premier, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, is known to favor gradual economic change and oppose a swift transition to full democracy. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, a 61-year-old Communist reformer confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as premier on Monday, has resisted recognition of unofficial groups as viable opposition forces or negotiating partners. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> has said the government has no intention of tearing down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, which it opened to free travel in an effort to halt an exodus of refugees and appease a public that has taken to the streets en masse since early October to demand free elections and other reforms. In the newest challenge to the Communists' supremacy, Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON> said Tuesday he would seek to amend the constitution so the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is no longer deemed the leading force in society. Maleuda, elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Monday in the chamber's first-ever secret ballot, made the remark at a meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ one of the four formal opposition parties that have recently begun to assert independence The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also called for increased power-sharing. It urged convening talks, to include the unofficial opposition, patterned after negotiations held in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that helped usher in the Solidarity-led government. In a development heralding the possible inclusion of another prominent reformer in the government, Politburo member <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> resigned as <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Communist boss. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, the party's propaganda chief, had announced Thursday's opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders. His resignation was considered a possible prelude to his appointment to an influential post in the government. A celebration began at the <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> on Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> leadership was contemplating a new hole in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall that would reconnect the central monument with the West. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, revelers who waited in excited anticipation of reopening of the famed thoroughfare dwindled to a few hundred after dawn when rumors spread that the new East-West crossing would open only on Thursday. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said, meanwhile, that it is setting up reception centers for any East Germans who fled to the West and now want to return. It said the centers can handle up to 10,000 people. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it did not expect many of the 200,000 who have fled to the West this year to return. The emigration has seriously depleted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s labor force.

<TEXT>
 The lone elected black member of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s city commission attributed his re-election to `` tri-ethnic'' support, although ballots were cast mainly along ethnic lines in this racially tense city. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> was re-elected in Tuesday's runoff by carrying nearly 99 percent of the black vote and 75 percent of the non-Latin white vote. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>' Cuban-born challenger, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, carried the largest bloc of votes, Hispanics, with 78 percent. With all 86 precincts and absentees counted, <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a two-term incumbent, had 18,245 votes, or 52.7 percent, to 16,402 votes, or 47.3 percent, for <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>. `` I got the majority of the black votes, I got enough of the Latin to win away from a Latin opponent, and I got the white votes,'' <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> said. `` So that's why I have a tri-ethnic vote.'' <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, a former commissioner, had Spanish-language ads suggesting `` all the Cubans vote for <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, 64, had said he did n't believe his was `` the black seat,'' but added that the city's black residents _ about 30 percent of the voters _ deserved representation on the commission. The turnout among Hispanic voters was 40.5 percent, black turnout 35.6 percent, and non-Latin white turnout 22.6 percent. When <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> is sworn in, he will become the only black on the city commission. <PERSON> Athalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Range </PERSON>, who is black, had been appointed last summer to complete <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s term but did not seek election on Tuesday. In Tuesday's other race, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 44, lost a bid to regain her seat to <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, 48. Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> received 17,561 votes, or 53.2 percent, compared with Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 15,461 votes, or 46.82 percent. `` <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> is going to bring a voice that is going to be the voice of the people, the voice of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> said after her victory. `` I'm going to be working with everyone in the city of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to prove that I can be the person that will unite <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a college administrator, led a six-candidate primary Nov. 7 by 691 votes. He was supported by some Hispanic leaders who said it was important symbolically to have at least one black commissioner. <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, a 34-year-old former policeman who served two terms before losing the 1987 election, ran a slashing campaign that linked <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> with a drug trafficker and called him the worst commissioner in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> history. Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, last week easily re-elected to a new four-year term, called <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> disruptive and supported <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who resigned her seat to run unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, charged Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> with `` a penchant for demagoguery.'' Her commercials called Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> `` an opportunist who does not respect the law,'' a reference to a 1988 court decision that knocked Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> off the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ballot because of a residency violation. Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> concentrated her campaign among Hispanic voters. She picked up 65.3 percent of the Hispanic vote to Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 34.7 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> carried the other ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Denver Housing Authority Director Resigns Amid Furor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The director of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has quit after 33 years with the agency, citing blame heaped on him over a plan to move poor people into middle-class neighborhoods. `` Everybody has called for my head without cause,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzlaff </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The focus has turned from housing to witch-hunting, head-hunting, which has really taken away from what the housing authority is all about.'' <PERSON> Ratzlaff </PERSON> began working for the agency as a handyman in 1956 and had been director since 1976. He supervised public housing for 27,000 people and earned $ 70,000 a year. <PERSON> Ratzlaff </PERSON> and his staff were faulted, most notably by Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, for misjudging community concerns about a plan to relocate several hundred residents of inner-city projects to homes in middle-class neighborhoods. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ratzlaff </PERSON>'s departure will restore public confidence in the agency and added that he did n't agree with the five-member housing commission's decision to keep <PERSON> Ratzlaff </PERSON> on as a consulant at his annual salary. The approach of scattering public housing in middle-class neighborhoods has been tried in various cities, with the goal of avoiding the drug and crime problems that plague big, inner-city projects. Opponents say it simply transplants problems and can isolate those involved from social services and public transportation that they rely on.

<HEAD>Striking Soviet Miners Lose Appeal of Court Ruling Walkout Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Russian Federation's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has upheld a ruling that a strike by Arctic coal miners is illegal and that organizers could lose their jobs and face stiff fines, a strike leader said today. `` The consequences will follow us the rest of our lives,'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teryokhin </PERSON> told reporters. He said the ruling was made Tuedsay. About 15,000 miners at 12 of the 13 shafts in the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> coal fields, 950 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, walked off the job Oct. 25 to press the government to fulfill promised improvements in working and living conditions and to implement far-reaching political reforms. They defied calls by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> and other officials to return to work, even though the walkout is depleting fuel supplies as the country heads into winter. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday the strike has cut coal deliveries from the region's mines by more than a half-million tons, and the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>'s electricity and heating supplies were threatened because of a coal shortage. First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> says rationing of heat, light and electricity may be necessary. On Oct. 27, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Autonomous </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> is located, said the strike `` grossly violated'' a labor law passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature earlier in the month. The court found the miners in violation of provisions of the law that require conciliation and arbitration commissions to be set up before a strike occurs. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION>, which includes the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Autonomous </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, upheld the lower court's decision, clearing the way for the sanctions to be imposed, <PERSON> Teryokhin </PERSON> said The court decision means the strike organizers face firing from the jobs and fines of $ 1,620 each. The case can not be appealed to the national <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The miners had asked that the ruling be set aside because they contended proper court procedure was not followed. Four strike organizers are scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss the walkout, but their representatives expressed little hope a solution will be reached. Virtually all the nation's coal miners ended a two-week strike in July after the government passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social and economic conditions. The miners now say the government is not fulfilling its promises. The workers also have advanced new political demands, including removing language in the Soviet Constitution making the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the leading force of society. They demand that power be turned over to local governing councils, land to farmers and factories to workers.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, given a roaring welcome by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, today welcomed moves to send millions of dollars of aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but said far more is needed to rescue his nation's economy from `` the verge of utter catastrophe.'' `` We are not asking for charity, or expecting philanthropy, but we would like to see our country treated as a partner and a friend,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a historic speech to a joint meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A chorus of ` Bravo, <LOCATION> Bravo </LOCATION>, Bravo,'' resounded through the jammed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber as <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made his way to the podium. He stood in silence as the ovation thundered on for seven minutes. `` ` We the people.' With these words I wish to begin my address,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> started out, quoting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wore buttons reading, `` Solidarnosc,'' the Polish name of the Solidarity union movement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> brought the cheers to their highest pitch when he raised his arms and flashed a double `` V'' sign with his hands _ a symbol favored in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by Solidarity supporters. After his speech, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was meeting congressional leaders, sitting down with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and returning to the Capitol for a dinner. He dined with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House Tuesday night. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s appearance marked only the second time a foreign private citizen spoke to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the first since the Marquis de Lafayette appeared in 1824. He used it to call on those in the West who are now praising Solidarity to back their words with solid economic support. `` Being a worker and a man of concrete work, I must tell you that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful, but the demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now,'' the 46-year-old onetime shipyard electrician said. As <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke in Polish, his audience read an English translation, filling the chamber with the rustle of paper as they turned each of the seven pages. An interpreter rendered his words into English for a vaster television audience. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was repeatedly interrupted with applause. It filled the chamber as he concluded, walked from therostrum and pumped hands all the way to the door. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> worked to resolve differences over legislation to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to his country. His speech in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber came on the second day of a week-long trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 Tuesday to authorize $ 657 million in economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> over three years and $ 81 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> nation attempting to shed its rigidly controlled economy. The House went further, approving an initial one-year installment of $ 533 million for the two nations. In his speech, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> offered a lengthy history of the Solidarity labor movement and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy under four decades of communist rule. He said investment from abroad was the only way to avoid economic collapse as the new Solidarity-led government shifts to a market economy. Efforts to rebuild the economy face `` a grave danger'' because of `` our long subjection to a political system incompatible with national traditions, to a system of economy incompatible with rationality and common sense, coupled with the stifling of independent thought and disregard for national interests,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` All this has led the Polish economy to ruin, to the verge of utter catastrophe,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also took time to thank the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for their support of Solidarity during the 1980s. `` It is they who supported us in the difficult days of martial law and persecution,'' he said. `` It is they who sent us aid, who protested against violence. Today, when I am able to freely address the whole world from this elevated spot, I would like to thank them with special warmth.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the economic assistance planned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` opens a new road'' to rebuild the Polish economy. `` For this wonderful decision I thank you warmly. I promise you that this aid will not be wasted and will never be forgotten,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told audiences Tuesday that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs massive Western investment to `` make her way to the shore of freedom.'' `` I know that the pioneer spirit which made this country big and free is still around,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> labor federation. `` I would like you to transplant this spirit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. ... Do not let the world and us wait any longer.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> wept openly after a 15-minute standing ovation welcoming him to the convention hall. He thanked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its people, its labor movement and its government for being `` our most steadfast allies'' in Solidarity's long and bitter struggle with the communist regime it eventually replaced in free elections. `` Today, when we are threatened by recession and inflation rather than police repressions, we need this international solidarity no less than in the past,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION>, which he won in 1981, two years before receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. The eight-year delay in collecting the award was caused by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s fear he would be barred from returning to his country and forced into exile. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday, told a news conference: `` Our country needs your experience, your knowledge, your modern technologies. `` Sometimes we feel as if we are swimming chained hand and foot, trying to summon all our energy just to make it safely to shore,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` And on the shore there is a cheering crowd of people who offer us their admiration instead of simply throwing a life belt. `` We want to make it to the shore, to join the community of democratic countries with efficient economies,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Patient Says Psychic Healer Didn't Stop Her Pain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lesya </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurshova </PERSON> smiled for the TV camera while doctors operated on her hernia with no other anesthetic than the mental energy of one of the country's popular psychic healers. Eight and a half months later, however, she has stopped smiling and started talking: she was in `` monstrous pain, which tormented me from the first minute of the operation until the end.'' Her revelation in an interview with the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> was the most damaging of several reports this week clouding the reputation of <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON>, which quickly drew the attention of many Soviets. <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON> is one of the two best-known healers who have gripped Soviet society this year with their claims to be able to cure illnesses with mental energy, even over TV. Many people have turned to them out of despair over a medical system in which many medicines are not available, and much of the equipment and scientific knowledge is out of date. Miss <PERSON> Yurshova </PERSON> underwent the operation in the capital of the Georgian republic, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON> was hundreds of miles away. His mental energy, transmitted to Miss <PERSON> Yurshova </PERSON> over television, was to block the pain. The operation helped build <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON>'s reputation as a healer among Soviets. She said in the interview published in Wednesday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, that she endured the pain _ and even smiled for the camera _ because she did not want to let him down. The faith healer promised she would feel nothing worse than a mosquito bite, and that after recovering that she would travel abroad to advertise his method, Miss <PERSON> Yershova </PERSON> said. In a TV session shown Tuesday night on the late evening program `` Good Evening, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurshova </PERSON> attacked him only because he did not send her abroad as promised. <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON>, staring straight into the TV camera with his dark eyes, also told his followers he could not be blamed for `` pure coincidences.'' <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON> and another healer, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON>, have appeared all over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including at news conferences at the Soviet Foreign Ministry's information department. Their popularity has spread widely through their exposure on television. Citing viewer surveys that indicate many people believe <PERSON> Chumak </PERSON>'s sessions have helped them, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that beginning Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>'s world service would begin transmitting a 5-10 minute program with the healer in more than 10 languages Miss <PERSON> Yurshova </PERSON> said she broke her silence because of her worsening health and <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON>'s indifference. Her eyesight and hearing have worsened and she suffers headaches and chest pain, she said. `` After the operation, which was another step toward Olympus for <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailovich </PERSON>, he became indifferent to my fate, and he told me so,'' she told the respected newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this week on claims that a 7-year-old boy lost consciousness and was paralyzed after watching one of <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON>'s televised sessions. Doctors familiar with the boy's case told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> the boy was suffering from an infection of the brain, and that <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON> had nothing to do with it one way or the other. In another case detailed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cooperative is being investigated for allegedly trying to organize a phony healing session in the southern city of <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> for an advance price of $ 97,000. Officials said they have determined <PERSON> Kashpirovsky </PERSON> was not involved in the plan.

pvs, The order</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House said today an unprecedented 48-hour cutback in naval operations is `` important for the safety of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'' and would not compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> readiness at sea. `` It's exactly the right thing and it was done in the right manner,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The unprecedented operations cutback and 48-hour safety check _ designed to stem the string of deadly accidents plaguing the service _ was announced Tuesday by Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, the chief of naval operations. He ordered that a `` safety stand-down'' be conducted at all <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> facilities within three days. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the order `` does not involve the front-line forces and those in places like the Med -LRB- iterranean -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and so forth that are involved in militarily sensitive situations.'' The spokesman said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not have advance notice of the safety review because `` it's an administrative action that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has taken ... and there was no need to notify the White House.'' However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added, `` We do support it. We think it's important for the safety of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, in announcing the decision, told reporters that `` prudent leadership demands that we take a look at everything that might be a possible cause for this recent spate of accidents, regardless of their severity.'' The order requires ships, flying squadrons and shore facilities to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and operating procedures. However, it allows such operations as ship movements in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and drug-interdiction activities to continue, the four-star admiral said. `` A stand-down ... does not say, bring ships in from sea, stop flying airplanes completely. ... Clearly, operations around the world must continue,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said. In his statement, <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> told fleet commanders and other senior <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> leaders that they should `` leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of operations is foremost in the minds of all hands.'' The order also requires all commanders to report their findings after the 48-hour interruption in operations. The action came as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has suffered through a series of mishaps since Oct. 29 in which 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 53 people injured. Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> counted 101 `` operation and training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19. The admiral defended the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s safety record, saying that absent the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> fatalities, this would be the service's safest year in this decade. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said he has found no common thread in the recent spate of accidents, that some were due to mechanical failure while others were caused by human error, such as a lapse of attention to procedure. He said he did not believe commanders were working their sailors too hard, but he wanted to ensure that no short cuts were being taken during the many dangerous activities that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel must conduct every day. The admiral said all commanders should ask: `` Are we adhering to all the proper procedures, are we doing what we should be, the way we should be doing it? ... Is there something we're overlooking? Are people getting careless?'' `` I would say there are three problems here,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary during part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said today on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` One is the continuous operating environment where you can get careless. The second is the technical nature of the equipment, but I would say by and large the people are very good right now. `` The third is the training environment, teaching people how to anticipate problems and to make sure ... junior leaders are supervising when the people under them are in a dangerous environment,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 599,000 full-time personnel and some 566 ships _ and usually a third of those are at sea for training operations at any one time. The announcement came as three more incidents were added to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s accident list: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14 jet fighter crashed in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with the crew escaping serious injury _ A fire broke out aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Inchon in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, injuring 31 people, as the vessel was undergoing shipyard maintenance _ A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ordnance technician suffered minor burns and possible eye injuries when an experimental explosive mixture detonated in a research laboratory at the Naval Surface Weapons Testing Center in White Oak, Md In recent weeks, the service has been plagued by a number of deadly accidents including a training jet crashing into an aircraft carrier off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in which five people were killed; sailors who have been washed overboard on two different aircraft carriers and the accidental bombing of a ship by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. On Monday, the destroyer USS Kinkaid and a freighter collided in the <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, 240 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, killing one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> crewman, injuring five, and starting fires on both vessels. Last Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed into an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, killing two civilians and injuring two others, including himself. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the action `` a prudent step.'' `` If I were the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> today I would be taking the exact same steps,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that although the recent accidents did n't appear to be related, it was a `` very wise move'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s part to review safety procedures Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials, also said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was wise, but he added criticism of the service's leadership In particular, he complained the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided to make Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, skipper of the USS Iowa, eligible for another major command. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion killed 47 sailors, including the gunner's mate that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> later said `` most likely'' caused the blast intentionally

<HEAD>German Drama Forces Britain to Rethink its Place in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drama in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is forcing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to ponder anew its place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some analysts say now is the time to get into closer step with the Continent, to join forces in order to absorb a unified German colossus and thus render it harmless. Others argue the opposite: that as the old order unravels and long-held certainties disintegrate, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should keep its distance and wait for the dust of the crumbling <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to settle. The question of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is an old one, but it had become urgent well before the momentous changes overtook <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the Germanys. The 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is a member, is to become a single tariff - and passport-free trading bloc at the end of 1992, and has ambitious plans for monetary union and Europe-wide standards on workers' rights and social welfare Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the crusading free-marketeer, believes these are corporatist tendencies, and that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> is trying to foist on her the very socialist constraints she has fought for 10 years to eradicate in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Economic and monetary union, which <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is pressing, would be an intolerable encroachment on national sovereignty, says Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, she insists, is primarily a trading bloc, and that by unshackling the markets, abolishing currency controls and opening <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to outside investment, she is being a good European. She repeated this position Monday, signaling that events in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had not changed her mind at all. But the conflicting reactions to her speech underlined the differing attitudes. While <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> praised `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s realism,'' the Guardian denounced her as `` the supreme nitpicker of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Britons who share Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s view `` tend to see the internal market as the end of a process, while the others see it as the beginning of something more dynamic,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanor </PERSON>, a constitutional expert at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Until recently, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s approach seemed like smart politics. The British never have shared the Continent's romantic, philosophical notion of `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' They sometimes seem to relish being odd nation out, whether in refusing to join the exchange rate mechanism that harmonizes the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, or in resisting attempts by <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to impose new health warnings on cigarette packs. They cling to what sets them apart, whether it's driving on the left or measuring distances in miles. Their biggest-circulation newspaper repeatedly derides the French as `` Frogs,'' and union featherbedding is known as `` Spanish practices.'' In the election campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in June, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> built its propaganda around the specter of interfering <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats, complete with feeble puns about force-feeding the British on <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> were routed by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and many analysts sensed a sea change in public opinion. Perhaps, it was suggested, Europe-bashing was no longer a vote-catcher. The issue of the exchange rate mechanism triggered a crisis last month that prompted the resignation of <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, chancellor of the exchequer and architect of the boom of the mid-1980s. Now comes a new and bigger challenge in the shape of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The pro-integrationists paint a scenario of a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with an economy as big and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s combined. To prevent <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> going neutral and drifting to the new markets of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> must tighten its bonds, thus tying <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> inextricably to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and dampening any temptation by German to flex its nationalist muscle. The counterargument says harmonization of social law and monetary union are difficult enough when economies as different as <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s are involved. <LOCATION> Add </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and later, perhaps, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and harmonization begins to look like a joke. `` -LRB- For -RRB- those who worry about a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> getting back to its old style through reunification, the only answer is to bind <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> more tightly and tightly to the Community,'' says former Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, who took <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> into the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. `` If <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is going to be bound more tightly into the Community, then we in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have got to be as well,'' he said Wednesday. `` If we drag our feet, then they'll go ahead and just leave us outside.''

<HEAD>Rock Aid Armenia Record Song To Aid Earthquake Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirteen of the biggest names in rock music have recorded a remake of the Deep Purple classic `` Smoke on the Water'' to raise money for victims of the earthquake that devastated parts of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last year. The group, known as <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION>, launched the single at a news conference Wednesday and said they hope to raise $ 1.6 million from the single, an album and video. The single will be released on Nov. 27. The all-star line-up includes <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmore </PERSON>, formerly of Deep Purple, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON> of <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of Iron Maiden, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Emerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of Queen. Sitting beneath two moving logos of the charity <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> and a black and white photo of an earthquake victim lying in rubble, <PERSON> Gillan </PERSON> explained they were not looking for halos. `` We had a great time doing the record and we hope it's going to do some good for the people of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` ` Smoke on the Water' is ideal for something like this. It's a song that was born out of disaster and ended up being a triumph,'' he said, explaining that the original was inspired by a lakeside fire in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> where Deep Purple were recording. <PERSON> Gillan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Iommi </PERSON>, from <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabbath </ORGANIZATION>, are planning separate trips to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and hope to visit <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. An album and a video made for Rock Aid <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> will be released Dec. 8. They feature additional classic tracks including songs from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Led </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeppelin </LOCATION>, Foreigner, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and the Mechanics, Genesis, Rush, Yes and The Quire Boys. The stars provided their services free and have promised every penny raised from the worldwide sales will go to charities working in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. They estimate they have already secured advance sales of more than 250,000 dollars. The Armenian earthquake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter Scale, struck on Dec. 7, killing more than 25,000 people, leaving 500,000 homeless and 50 towns and cities flattened.

 The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, consisting mainly of career <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, gave a collective gasp when Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> cheerfully said he hoped to see them all in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> soon. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, giving a pep talk to the embassy staff, assured them he was just being friendly, that he thought they were doing a great job improving relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that the Solidarity-led government has no plans to call them home. `` I am not taking the place of the government. I am not replacing anybody at the embassy,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. That was good news for Ambassador <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinast </PERSON>, who served as deputy foreign minister in the communist-led government that preceded Solidarity to pwer and who has been working long hours since then to rally <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic support for the new reform government. The embassy staff played virtually no role in arranging the <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> visit, which was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> labor federation. But its diplomats have had their hands full getting ready for visits by many Polish government dignitaries and an unending stream of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional and administration figures headed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krystosik </PERSON>, the No. 2 embassy official, said in an interview this week. Many of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign service professionals shared the conciliatory sentiments expressed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. `` We should forget our differences,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told them. `` We have had many over the last 45 years. Many of those were caused by others.'' `` This is the time for ... all Poles to work together for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the diplomats, assembled in the second floor reception room of the stately turn-of-the century mansion atop <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He spoke to them Tuesday during a hectic week, and his remarks were recounted by three Poles who were present. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who is chairman of the Solidarity trade union but holds no government post, arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday on a trip that includes numerous honors as well as non-stop exhortations for Americans to send aid and investment to bolster the Polish reforms. His remark about seeing the Polish diplomats soon in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, delivered at the end of a short pep talk, was taken in the same good humor it was made, said one Pole who was present. `` It did n't have any overtones at all,'' said a Polish diplomat who spoke on condition he not be further identified. `` He was very courteous and was very well received.'' Although courtesy can not entirely ease the tension caused in the diplomatic corps by the fall of the communist government after 45 years in power, <PERSON> Krystosik </PERSON> said the embassy staff is dedicated to seeking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to bolster the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s reform government. `` We know very well how important is the role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the leader of the Western world. We know very well the initiative of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> organizing and sponsoring assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a program that paves the way for the implementation of Polish reforms,'' he said. `` The embassy presents the policy line of the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>,'' the Solidarity adviser that heads the government, said <PERSON> Krystosik </PERSON>. Besides, said other Polish diplomats, the presence of a Solidarity rather than a communist government in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> has eased one of their main tasks, promoting U.S.-Polish friendship. Polish diplomats, showing a reporter around the embassy this week, eagerly pointed out icons of Polish-American friendship, including a letter to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> from <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosciusko </PERSON>, a Pole who served as a colonel in the American Revolution then returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and led two uprisings against Russian domination. In one corner of the main reception area stands a Steinway grand piano owned by <PERSON> Ignace </PERSON> <PERSON> Paderewski </PERSON>, who was Polish premier in 1919 and who performed many times in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a reknowned concert pianist. One Polish diplomat played a few bars on the piano, looked up thoughtfully and said, `` we really ought to get this thing tuned.''

 The Nicaraguan government, in a bid to break an impasse in negotiations with the Contras, has dropped its demand for the immediate demobilization of the rebels, a Sandinista official said today. Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the government instead is insisting, as its price for a restoration of a cease-fire, the evacuation of the rebels from Nicaraguan territory to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We think that is a very important change in our position,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. When the two sides recessed Tuesday evening after their fourth round of talks, Nicaraguan Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> was downcast as he spoke to reporters. `` I was more optimistic last Thursday -LRB- when the talks started -RRB- than I am now,'' he said. The talks were to resume later today. The Sandinistas and the Contras both agree a cease-fire should be a first step, but beyond that there is a large gap between their respective positions. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that he is sending a 20-member congressional team to monitor the elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and he vowed to make <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> arms shipments to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> an issue at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> superpower summit in 18 days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Soviets can help facilitate free elections by cutting off arms deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, `` the one country that seems to be swimming against the -LRB- democratic -RRB- tide.'' Chief Contra negotiator Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` are conditioning everything on the withdrawal of our forces from Nicaraguan territory and their demobilization.'' The estimated 5,000 Contras based in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said, should be allowed to remain in place when the cease-fire goes into effect. The two sides had been informally observing a cease-fire reached in March 1988 but President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, contending there had been widespread violations by Contra forces, allowed the truce to lapse Nov. 1. He has said that elections set for Feb. 25 will go ahead as scheduled even if there is no settlement with the Contras. The rebels are wary about demobilizing without ironclad guarantees that they will be able to return in safety to a democratic <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> complained that the Sandinista delegation refused to consider a truce even for the duration of the peace talks. Helping to prod the delegations toward a settlement were representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They are members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up to oversee the peace process. <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON> y Bravo is attending the talks as a `` witness.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alleged anew that the Sandinistas for their part are arming the Marxist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Salvadoran rebels are engaging in `` senseless bloodshed'' and are `` aided and abetted by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday at a luncheon meeting for <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers gathered here. The Salvadoran rebels launched the biggest offensive of their 10-year war over the weekend, virtually paralyzing much of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and leaving hundreds dead. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the administration was enlisting retired diplomat <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON> to give advice and monitor the Nicaraguan talks. <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON>, 63, has agreed to work as a consultant to the department but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said he will not participate directly in the discussions nor have substantive contact with Sandinista officials. Nonetheless, a senior official said <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON> did have a half-hour meeting in recent days with Sandinista diplomats at their request. `` He was in a listening capacity,'' said the official, asking not to be identified.

 The White House said today `` we have no apologies'' for extolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic woes of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position should not be offensive to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The statement by White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> followed a warning by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the West should not gloat about the demise of socialism or attempt to `` export capitalism.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> views the free-market economy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the `` pride of the world and as a good way to reform the economic problems that they are facing. `` We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the rewards that it has offered,'' he added. `` We hold it up as an example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these countries.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, all the actions taken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` have been appropriate and not been offensive and have had the desired effect of offering our support without inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process backward ... We have no apologies or concern with anything that we've done at this point.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Westerners who claim the changes in the East signify the failure of socialism are engaging in `` wishful thinking.'' He did not say to whom he was referring. `` We are expanding the potential of the socialist social system,'' he said today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will meet <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at a summit Dec. 2-3, declared himself unconcerned Tuesday about the dizzying pace of change _ most recently the opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders and the easing of travel restrictions by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think it's moving too fast and I do n't know of anybody in my administration that feels that it's moving too fast,'' the president said. Even so, administration officials acknowledge they have been surprised by the rapidly changing events. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said experts from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies were evaluating developments in the wake of last week's opening of the Berlin Wall. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that, rather than be preoccupied by the idea of the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` there are large issues of East-West relations, of the NATO-Warsaw Pact's future, of the status of the Soviet empire as these countries change their relationship'' with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` All of those issues and questions are being considered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government at this time,'' he said. `` Obviously the questions call for answers that will lead to changing relationships and new policies and programs.'' The changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be at the top of the agenda when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meets <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the shipboard summit in the waters of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Despite heightened expectations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to play down the summit. `` We still see it as an informal meeting where no decisions will be made,'' said one administration official, insisting on anonymity. But some political leaders are expressing concerns about the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has warned that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should expect a proposal from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to withdraw all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet armed forces from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> within a few years The administration also has been warned that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may propose dismantling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of the developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during a speech to a gathering of foreign ministers from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations. `` I'm sure the people in every country here are caught up in this fantastic change that's taking place,'' he said. Democrats are pressing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to respond more strongly to the changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said it was regrettable that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had rejected the idea of going to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to express <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> satisfaction with the `` symbolic destruction'' of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed himself on issues before and I hold out hope he will do so again,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed the decision by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, one of the last hard-line Soviet bloc nations, to ease travel restrictions on its citizens, calling it `` a very encouraging first step.'' `` Several months ago we called for a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free, and as I survey the changes taking place, it seems to be moving towards a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have the same aspirations for freedom that others have. And I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` So it's a very good and encouraging step,'' he said. `` And this is further manifestation that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> some day will be whole and free.''

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Nov. 10 The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>: The Iron Curtain is up. The Berlin Wall is down. Communism is on the rocks, or so it seems, based on the most recent news from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A propaganda minister for that nation announced ... the opening of East German borders to unrestricted travel, a liberty denied citizens since the infamous wall was erected in 1961. This dramatic policy turnaround, although a long-awaited step toward freedom, seems likely to accelerate the recent exodus from East to West. That could pose enormous social and economic difficulties for both Germanys. So far in 1989 more than 200,000 discontent East Germans have fled their country seeking better lives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As the East is losing its workers and young people, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is running out of jobs and housing. Not a moment too soon _ perhaps 28 years too late _ the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> government </ORGANIZATION> has heard its citizens' demands. ... <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new head of state, advocated a law ... that would ensure `` free, democratic general elections with a secret ballot'' and with `` public supervision in every stage of the balloting.'' ... <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> also has been pleading publicly for his countrymen to remain in their homeland and help build a new nation. Western leaders should join in encouraging East German citizens to stay and shape their free, democratic destiny. But why should East Germans heed this call and take a chance on a bloody crackdown? That's nearly impossible to answer. Yet an active role by the West might help push forward reforms and guard against a Tiananmen Square-type massacre. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> already has pledged to meet with ... <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and has offered far-reaching aid if real political and economic changes take root. President ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and leaders of the other Western European nations would do well to follow ... <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s lead.

 Nov. 11 Baraboo -LRB- <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Republic on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>: There could be no greater symbol of the changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than -LRB- the -RRB- announcement that the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall no longer would stand in the way of free travel for East Germans. The news must come as a special joy to the millions of veterans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who fought in two world wars to retain freedoms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. ... The Wall has stood for 28 years as a stark reminder that sharp divisions existed between East and West. While the Wall was effective in holding East Germans hostage to a totalitarian regime, it could not bend the minds of citizens who knew its true meaning _ not a wall to protect them from the West, but rather, a wall to prevent them from getting to the West.

An aroused electorate is closely watching the uncomfortable gyrations of politicians and subjecting them to an abortion litmus test.

But if the public is becoming more tolerant about homosexuals in uniform, the Pentagon is not, judging from its reaction to a couple of studies on the topic. The first study ... is on whether homosexuals are security risks. After reviewing the professional literature, the researchers conclude that homosexuals posed no more of a risk to expionage blackmail than heterosexuals. When the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> saw an early draft, it called the report flawed, biased and a waste of money. ... The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s overreaction was not due to the quality of the report's scholarship, which is high, but to the fact that the study's findings disagree with the current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> policy to ban all homosexuals, period. A second study by the center also set off fireworks. It found that homosexuals who attempted to join the military had fewer personal problems and were likely to adjust to military life `` as good or better than heterosexuals.''

 Nov. 11 <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on the stealth bomber: <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is poised to pay for at least two more B-2 stealth bombers at $ 530 million each, the most expensive airplane in the nation's history. But it also has attached enough strings to make certain that the B-2 does not fly away with the defense budget. That makes sense, in light of a study that says that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would spend 14 timesas much to hit a target with a B-2 as it would have to spend to hit the same target with alternative weapons already on hand ... In theory, the B-2 could pounce on targets before an enemy knew it was coming. But according to a recent analysis published by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, using a B-2 would cost more than using a Midgetman missile, a single-warhead missile that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has resisted as too expensive. In fact, the ability to sneak past radar may not even be important in a war. The bomber would reach targets in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> long after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had started retaliating with long-range missiles that might well have destroyed or at least ripped big holes in the radar screen of the Soviet air-defense network, so stealth would not be important. If some radar were to survive, there are nearly 100 B-1b bombers already on duty that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says are nearly as elusive as the B-2. ... Stealth bombers would be good for dropping bombs that would burrow into Soviet command posts and explode, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says. But does that mission make sense? Would America want to kill the only Soviets who might be able and willing to call off a nuclear war?

<HEAD>TV Broadcasts Radical's Appeal For Peace Hours After He Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government TV on Wednesday broadcast an appeal for peace by a radical Sinhalese leader that was videotaped while he was in custody and hours before he was shot to death by government troops. Officials also reported finding the bodies of 31 suspected Sinhalese radicals Wednesday and blamed the killings on vigilantes in favor of the Sinhalese-dominated government in a country wracked by ethnic and factional strife. `` I appeal to all my followers to give up their armed struggle against the government and take to the democratic process to achieve our goals,'' said <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, in the broadcast. <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, who was captured Sunday, voluntarily made the appeal for peace and `` sang like a bird'' about the whereabouts of his top lieutenants, said a senior military source. He and the front's No. 2 and No. 3 men were shot and killed within the next 18 hours, according to government announcements. The avowed Marxist, who used to have a beard and mustache, was clean-shaven and the television clip showed him wearing a red beret and a white shirt. He looked nervous but appeared to be in good health while making the Sinhalese-language broadcast. The government said <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> led security personnel to the group's <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> headquarters Monday to question D.B. <PERSON> Herath </PERSON>, the third-ranking leader of the front. `` Herath pulled a pistol and began firing at <LOCATION> Wijeweera </LOCATION> and troops opened fire, killing both of them,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>. The front's No. 2 man, <PERSON> Upatissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamanayake </PERSON>, was killed while trying to escape capture Monday, the government said. Political leaders sypathetic to the front predicted more violence could follow the death of <LOCATION> Wijeweera </LOCATION>, whose personal safety had been guaranteed by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dias </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the public would not believe the government's version of <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>'s death. The 31 bodies of suspected members of the group were discovered Wednesday in the central hills and were likely killed by pro-government vigilante groups, said the officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. More than 6,000 people have been killed since August 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> started assassinating government officials and supporters. The front professed outrage that the Sinhalese-dominated government was making concessions to the Tamil minority, and its battle escalated into a challenge of the government's right to exist. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, are mostly Hindus and claim the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority discriminate against them in jobs and education.

<HEAD>Analysts See Warning in Inventory Growth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Growth of business inventories outpaced business sales in September, the government said Wednesday in a report that analysts said contained a warning of growing backlogs due to the slowing economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 791.8 billion after advancing 0.4 percent in August. Business sales, on the other hand, fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 524.6 billion following a 3 percent gain the previous month. The business activity produced a slight increase in the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.51, meaning it would take 1.51 months to exhaust inventories at the September pace. It was 1.50 in August. `` At the moment, the ratios do not appear excessive,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But they show the first signs of increases related to a declining business climate.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> agreed that on the surface the report suggests inventories are not yet a problem. `` But there are some warning signals in it of some excess at the consumer level,'' he said. Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as output exceeds demand, a process that could lead to production cuts and loss of jobs. The economy has been experiencing sluggishness as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tries to contain inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit. Retail inventories, up 1 percent in September, were of particular concern since an earlier report indicated they could be worse in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that retail sales fell a full 1 percent in October, including a 5.1 percent decline in car sales. Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of the total, slipped 0.1 percent and wholesale backlogs, accounting for 25 percent of the total, dropped 0.3 percent. Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, fell 1.6 percent in September. Retail and wholesale sales both were up 0.7 percent. Overall inventories were 6.4 percent above those of a year ago. Sales increased 6.7 percent over September 1988.

 The government Wednesday denied it was trying to `` export capitalism'' to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but reiterated that its Communist neighbor must undertake major economic reforms. `` We do not export capitalism. We export a lot of things, but not capitalism,'' chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> also indicated Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> may postpone a crucial summit with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> until after an emergency Dec. 15-17 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress that could choose a new party leadership. Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> has proposed a massive economic aid program for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, contingent upon concrete reforms in its state-controlled economy. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has promised sweeping economic reforms, without elaborating on specific plans. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has warned Westerners not to gloat over the shaky condition of communism in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and cautioned that `` exporting capitalism'' could hurt the growing climate of cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said economic assistance to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can not be successful unless the `` system of a state-planned economy'' gives way to a `` socially responsible market economy.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> rejected any suggestion that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wanted to impose its own type of economic system on its Communist neighbor. He said major economic reforms are needed if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> expects to attract investors. `` We say there must be market conditions which make it reasonable to invest there,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. But he shied away from stating flatly that a drastic economic overhaul in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was a pre-condition for financial aid. <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehe </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said there were some ways to help <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> soon, including renewal of its telephone communications network and environmental projects. But `` far-reaching changes in the current economic system'' are needed for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to be able to attract desperately needed private investment, <PERSON> Ruehe </PERSON> said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> should not set conditions for its aid. He did say reform must show `` definite signals,'' without explaining what the signals should be. `` We must tell them we are ready to be helpful,'' said <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s chief spokesman. At a news conference earlier in the day, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> may postpone his summit with East German leaders until the end of December. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> initially said he would meet with <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> either this month or in early December to discuss <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s direction and possible financial assistance. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s latest position is that the meeting will occur `` sometime this year,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. That left open the possibility the summit would be put off until after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> emergency congress. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, plans to fly to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday to prepare <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Wednesday met with the heads of eight ministries to discuss the situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The former guerrilla leader who is likely to become <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s first president promised Wednesday to protect individual rights but said he might establish a one-party political system. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, also said he would try to avoid dealings with the white-run government in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which is ceding control of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after a 74-year rule And he said English will become the sole official language of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s government and schools, with <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION> _ the language of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s dominant white group _ losing its official status. <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, which began a guerrilla war for independence against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1966, was declared the winner Tuesday of United Nations-supervised elections for an assembly that will draft a constitution and declare independence. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> will have 41 of the 72 seats in the assembly, which will convene next week. At least 48 of the 72 members, or two-thirds, must approve decisions by the assembly, and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> will have to bargain with at least some of the five other parties that won seats. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy, has 21 seats. No other parties won more than four seats. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said at a news conference that Namibians would not be pressured to join <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, but added: `` If the <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> people chose to go one-party and it is done at the polls democratically, it will certainly be so.'' Asked about civil liberties under a SWAPO-led government, he replied: `` Certainly there will be freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, freedom of association, and there will be also be freedom of religion.'' `` We have no intentions of imposing our views on others and anticipate no serious disagreements,'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said. `` We stand ready to be guided by the democratic principles of open discussion and decision by the majority.'' The last 1,500 South African troops will be withdrawn Nov. 23, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, the territory's South Africa-installed administrator. Most soldiers left by June, and remaining units have been confined to two northern bases. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said his future government would demand that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> surrender control of <LOCATION> Walvis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a South African enclave which serves as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s only deep-water port. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says its ownership of <LOCATION> Walvis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is upheld by international law, but Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Wednesday offered to negotiate terms of usage of the harbor. `` I have always said there are two South Africans: one led by white-minority settlers there _ that one we certainly will not deal with,'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said. `` But we respect non-racial <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ that's why we will deal with it.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> wants to declare independence as soon as possible, but <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> declined to set a date. Most observers believe <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> will become independent early next year as long as there are no serious hitches in writing the constitution. During his 30 years in exile, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, 60, and his movement were considered orthodox Marxists. Since <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders began returning to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> earlier this year, however, they have taken a more moderate approach. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> favors some government controls on the economy, welcomes foreign investors and wants good relations with East and West. He has repeatedly urged <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 75,000 whites, and civil servants in particular, to remain in the territory and help develop the emerging nation.

 Angry farmers and radical students demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food imports protested in about two dozen cities and rural areas Wednesday, hurling rocks and firebombs at police. In <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>, 130 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, protesters threw rocks and firebombs at the main gate of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base, demanding a ban on food imports, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said. South Korean police arrested five students. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reported minor damage to a guardhouse, but no injuries. About 2,000 students and farmers hurling firebombs and rocks battled riot police at <ORGANIZATION> Konkuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after they were prevented from marching into the street to protest the police blockade of their planned rally. The protesters demanded the downfall of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> as riot troopers, backed by armored vans firing tear gas, made repeated charges to drive them back. `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who enforce the opening of agricultural markets!'' the protesters chanted. They say cheap <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports threaten their livelihood. Police reported no injuries but said about 500 farmers and students were arrested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protesters gathered at <LOCATION> Konkuk </LOCATION> after some 7,000 riot police were deployed around <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s Yoido Plaza to foil the farmers' rally demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and also seeking an increase in prices for domestic farm products. Police blocked the rally after Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> ordered security forces Tuesday to launch a crackdown to block anti-government rallies by students, workers and farmers. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said groups of farmers held protests and sit-ins in about 20 rural areas, occupying government and political party offices, after police checkpoints blocked them. Police said about 8,000 farmers were blocked from leaving for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> across the country. About 100 farmers occupied an opposition party office in <LOCATION> Naju </LOCATION> near the southern city <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> after police stopped them from leaving for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which buys about 35 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s exports and ran an $ 8.6 billion trade deficit with the country last year, has been pressing for greater access to South Korean markets <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is reluctant to open agricultural markets to protect farmers. Dissidents and radical students are supporting farmers to try to expand anti-government forces.

 Abortion foes today savored their biggest victory since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opened the way in July _ the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Legislature's passage of the most restrictive abortion law in the country. `` It's a very bright day for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s national image,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliveau </PERSON>, a leader of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Pro-Life Federation. `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> will stand out as a leader in the nation. This legislation will be seen nationally as reasonable legislation.'' The bill, which bans most abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy and requires women to inform their husbands before getting an abortion, cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 33-17 on Tuesday and goes to Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill last month. `` I'm told the bill is in the same form as it was when it left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said today. `` If that's the case, I'll sign it.'' Abortion-rights advocates, after watching nine attempts to dilute or revise the bill fail, warned that the Legislature was out of step with national sentiment. `` It's a shame, a national disgrace,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumo </PERSON>, a Democrat. Some predicted abortion opponents would be voted out of office. `` Having failed to change their minds, we will seriously commit ourselves to changing their faces on Election Day,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Niebrzydowski </PERSON>, president of the state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> stands to become the first state to enact controls on abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> vs. Reproductive Health Services opened the way for new curbs. The court upheld a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law banning the use of public funds or facilities for abortions and requiring tests after 24 weeks of pregnancy to determine whether the fetus could survive outside the womb. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> bill expands on earlier restrictions in banning most abortions in public hospitals. It also bans abortions for the purpose of selecting the baby's sex; prohibits abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy unless the mother faces death or irreversible harm; establishes a 24-hour waiting period after an abortion is requested, and requires women to notify their husbands. An unmarried woman would not have to notify the father. The legislation also would require doctors to inform a woman of the age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the risks and alternatives. It also would regulate the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses. `` What the bill does is put some sensible guidelines into law to try to protect the life of an unborn child,'' said Republican Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfrick </PERSON>. `` It does n't prevent abortion, it just restricts it.'' Republican Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, who drafted the bill and guided it through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It's a big win; it's a big margin, it's great.'' Freind had said that the bill was designed as a direct challenge to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and that he hopes it becomes the vehicle for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn its 1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion. Passage of the bill puts the pro-choice movement in a quandary, forcing it to decide whether to challenge the law and risk losing <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Doctors performing abortions after 24 weeks or because of the sex of the fetus could receive up to seven years in prison and up to $ 15,000 in fines. A husband could seek damages against a doctor who performs an abortion without a form showing that he had been notified. Rep. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON>, a Democratic supporter of the bill, said the bill seeks penalties against doctors because they have `` duties over and above what normal people would have.'' `` The focus is not, absolutely not, on the woman having the abortion,'' he said. The woman should never be penalized for having an abortion.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Legislature has traditionally been anti-abortion, even though many polls show that most Pennsylvanians are pro-choice. The state has a large rural, conservative population, and both sides agree that the anti-abortion movement has been more efficient politically than the pro-choice side, employing picketing, phone calls and mass mailings. Over the past decade, the Legislature has several times passed restrictions on abortion, but some of the more extreme portions have been struck down by the courts. Passage of the bill comes after a series of victories elsewhere by the abortion-rights side. Two weeks ago, voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> elected governors with pro-choice positions. A special session of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last month ended with lawmakers rejecting every proposal to restrict abortions. Abortion foes in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> abandoned their attempts to get more restrictions passed until next year after a bill stalled last month in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. The biggest anti-abortion victory since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling came last month in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill requiring parental consent for a girl under the age of 18. That proposal is under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consideration.

<HEAD>Ultrasound Probes Give Inside View of Body</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Doctors exploring the body with tiny ultrasound probes say they have embarked on `` a fantastic voyage,'' getting an inside view of the maze of blood vessels and the heart itself. In scientific presentations Wednesday, doctors described experimental use of the devices to make live cross-sectional pictures that help them see problems and guide tools to fix them. `` It's a fantastic voyage,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Natesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandian </PERSON>. `` It's almost like you are traveling inside the blood vessels and looking around. Several other doctors working with the new technique also likened it to the exploits in `` Fantastic Voyage,'' a 1966 movie starring <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> in which miniaturized doctors traveled through their patient's bloodstream. <PERSON> Pandian </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> are among about 20 teams around the world that have been testing the new technology over the past two years. Several progress reports were presented at the annual meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Ultrasound is already widely used to take pictures from outside the body. In the new approach, however, ultrasound-generating crystals are put in the end of thin tubes called catheters and pushed through the blood vessels. The result is a detailed inside look at the arteries, as well as a cross-sectional view of their walls. `` It's the only technology we have in which we can actually characterize what's in the wall'' of the blood vessel, said Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. In many people with heart disease, fatty deposits clog the arteries that feed their heart muscle. Doctors say the new ultrasound probes should help them figure out the particular kind of material that makes up these lumps so they can pick the best tool to remove them. `` It's almost like live pathology, as though we had taken a section of the heart or blood vessel, stained it and looked at it under a microscope,'' said <PERSON> Pandian </PERSON>. Doctors can now use balloons that squeeze the fatty deposits out of the way, cut them with miniature saws, and burn them off with lasers. One drawback of some of the artery cleaning devices is that they sometimes remove too much, breaking through the artery wall. With the detail revealed by the new ultrasound pictures, doctors believe they will know when to halt before they do more harm than good. `` It will make us a lot smarter,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Isner </PERSON>'s team has also used the probes to look inside the heart while they fix defective heart valves. Eventually, he said, they might also be used to check the movement of the heart's walls and check it for clots. Among other studies presented at the meeting Wednesday: _ Doctors from <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said an experimental test appears to spot the earliest stages of cholesterol's damage to the blood vessels. They found that when exposed to the nerve chemical acetylcholine, healthy blood vessels expand, but if they are damaged, they contract. They hope to use the test to spot early signs of trouble in heart transplant recipients, who are at high risk for artery disease. _ Researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> found that in some cases, severely restricting salt in the diet may not be the best advice. In a study of young men, they found that half had no change or even a rise in their blood pressure while on a low-salt diet. The heart association said that despite these preliminary findings, it is sticking with its recommendation that people limit their daily intake to one and a half teaspoons of salt. _ Doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> found that people with large numbers of blood-clotting cells called platelets are at unusually high risk of death from heart disease. They followed 2,014 middle-aged men for 13 years and found that the 25 percent with the highest platelet counts had about double the death rate of the other men.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed today on a package of congressional pay raises and ethics reforms, clearing the way for swift action before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next week. `` I am very confident the president will make a statement later today,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., told reporters The pay plan would bring <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> salaries from $ 89,500 to about $ 120,700 in just over 13 months, and impose new ethics rules on the amount and type of outside income members could earn. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would apply to top officials government-wide, except for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which was consiering a separate ethics and pay package. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would get a 7.9 percent raise by Jan. 1, as a `` cost-of-living adjustment'' for the two years since salaries were last increased. A 25 percent raise would take effect a year later, to coincide with the loss in income <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would suffer when a prohibition takes effect on accepting fees for speeches before interest groups. The bill also would tighten rules for other outside income and gifts, require more disclosure of personal wealth and make other ethics reforms. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told lawmakers their plan failed to impose enough ethics restrictions on legislative branch officials and their staffs, similar to those governing the executive branch, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., met with White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> today and settled the dispute, the sources said The pay increase itself was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because it also applied to federal judges and top officials in the executive branch. House Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders had hoped to settle their discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by day's end Tuesday. They were forced to postpone until Thursday party caucuses planned for today as the first step in the final push. `` We want to make sure we can tell the caucus that we have an understanding,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus To demonstrate for rank-and-file members the bipartisan support for the pay raise, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., plan to appear before the House Republican Conference, and their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> counterparts, Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., were going before the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> expressed confidence the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would approve the pay-and-ethics plan. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sentiment remained uncertain, but <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he had received `` very strong assurances'' from the leaders of that chamber that it would not block the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he envisioned a different pay and ethics plan, one in which senators would take only part of the pay raise and phase out speech honoraria more slowly. But many House members expressed strong reservations about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, saying they feared the other chamber would stick the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with the worst of all worlds _ a politically difficult vote recorded in favor of a pay raise, and no pay raise. The new pay raise proposal is more modest than the 51 percent raise with no ethics package that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected last winter in response to a storm of public criticism. Instead of looking for ways to capitalize on the issue, Republicans and Democrats lingered on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor discussing arrangements for mutual political protection so they both could vote for the pay raise. `` It's better than <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> out there,'' said one Democrat, who insisted his name not be used.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> took his appeal against <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> talks to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today after a two-hour session with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> claimed `` some progress'' toward arranging talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the discussions would have to be continued. And <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stressed there was no reply yet from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which is acting as the surrogate for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said no deadline had been imposed. `` It's important not to become impatient when you're dealing with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Two thousand years is the normal wait for things to happen.'' As <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters who asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was frustrated: `` The peace process has been going on for a number of years. You keep working at it, and keep plugging away. You keep chipping away at it. You keep trying to make progress and trying to move forward.'' But, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added: `` You have to fight frustration because it's just not a fast process.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is appealing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> role in the talks being arranged between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader does not want to legitimize <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, which has conducted terrorist attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, or be drawn into negotiations over territory. Although <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> surfaced two months ago the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delayed until last week in arranging a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. This was interpreted in some reports as evidence of White House frustration with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader, on an 11-day trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, wants to restrict the talks with Palestinian Arabs to arrangements for limited self-rule on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not given its approval for the talks, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> might weigh giving iron-clad assurances to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against risking <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> disapproval. It is generally assumed Palestinians would not negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> without a green light from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and the organization is demanding a state carved out of territory held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who arrived Monday, saw <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> over lunch at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today before calling on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. On Thursday, the prime minister has scheduled meetings on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is acting as a surrogate for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and has asked for `` clarifications'' of a plan by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to get <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> together. The Israeli Cabinet, meanwhile, is seeking assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and its members would play no role in the talks. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> telephoned Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> Tuesday afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined to provide any information about their conversation. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` gave me the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the Palestinian request for clarifications and explanations that I had relayed last Friday,'' He offered no details. The situation has grown complex, even by Middle Eastern standards. Before the talks are held, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has proposed that he meet here with Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the points raised by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would have to be ironed out before <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> held the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting. `` We've always said you have to have acceptance on a framework,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> did not seem frustrated by the absence of an official response from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian talks. `` If at any point you get a positive reply, it's helpful,'' she said. `` But there is no time frame on it.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was visited in his midtown hotel suite Tuesday by officials from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying and research group, and from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He also met with Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> and other Israeli Embassy officials. Apart from some differences with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the prime minister has been getting conflicting advice from American Jews, who comprise the largest Jewish community in the world. Some are urging him to be conciliatory. Others are trying to bolster <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s resolve not to make territorial and other concessions before negotiations are held. Some 200 American rabbis signed a letter circulated by the American Jewish Peace Lobby urging <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to accept the principle _ before any negotiations _ that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should relinquish land in return for peace with the Arabs. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its well-being are not only the concerns of the inhabitants of that country, but touch the heart and religious feeling of every Jew in the world,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Malino </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said in a statement. `` We should be prepared to take the risk for peace we are so often prepared to take for war.''

<HEAD>Last-Chance Economic Reform Faces Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s top economist said Wednesday that reformers must push a radical, last-chance decentralization plan on a Soviet public and parliament that may be `` waiting for a miracle.'' Instead of taking the bitter medicine of higher prices, harder work and temporary unemployment in the next few years, Soviets expect `` those guys from UFOs will come down and explain everything,'' said Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>. If they fail to embrace the program, Soviets face widespread rationing and the failure of reform, he said. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> spoke at the end of a three-day conference of academics and economic managers devoted to his plan of measured price increases, dumping unprofitable state-run business, expanding forms of ownership and developing a stock market. It is the most detailed plan produced in more than four years. It spells out what interim steps the country must take to develop more of a market economy and attain convertibility of the ruble. The conference reached a general consensus on the need for change more radical than the government has tried so far, <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said, without giving details. The plan will be presented to the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies when it holds its second session Dec. 12, and is expected to serve as a blueprint for the government to measure several key pieces of economic legislation, including one on varied forms of property ownership. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said he expects resistance in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which resembled a poorly organized debating society through much of its first session six months ago. He said he was surprised by the mood of the academicians and economists. `` The conservative mood was stronger than I thought before the conference,'' he said. `` The powerful pressure was mostly exerted from the conservative side,'' <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said. `` Maybe that does reflect the general condition of the country.'' Most of the speeches from the conference have not been made public, and <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> would not specify what objections were voiced. The economist said that after a summer of strikes by thousands of coal miners and worsening shortages of many food items, the mood of the public appears to have gotten more conservative. Opening the conference Monday, he cited poll data that indicated 54 percent of those questioned thought the country's most urgent problem was to impose strict discipline and order. Another 40 percent thought that the government should impose more price controls rather than gradually free up prices, as called for in his plan. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> vowed to fight to change public opinion and convince the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. In September, the economist was subjected to a blistering attack in the Supreme Soviet legislature by lawmakers who criticized the conduct of cooperatives, the small private businesses allowed under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms that many suspect of price gouging and racketeering. `` If there is a shift to the right, it will complicate implementation of the program, but it wo n't make us go back,'' he said. `` Without restructuring the Soviet economy has no future,'' he added. Economists have rejected proposals to impose widespread rationing, which is popular with some Soviets because it appeals to the sense of equality drilled in over more than 70 years of Soviet power. <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said his plan gives local authorities the power to impose rationing if they wish. But it rejects rationing as a country-wide solution to shortages. He warned, however, that failure to adopt a radical reform will lead to widespread rationing. `` If something stands in the way of its implementation and we can not stabilize the situation in the country, this system will become unavoidable but it will mean an end to reform,'' he said.

<HEAD>Part-Time Soldier Injured in Letter Bomb Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A part-time soldier was injured Wednesday when a letter bomb sent to his home near <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> exploded as he opened it, police said. The man, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reserve force, escaped serious injury but was being treated in hospital for his wounds and for severe shock, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. The bomb was sent to the soldier's home in the <LOCATION> Rathcoole </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Newtownabbey </LOCATION> on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, police said. He was not identified. Lt. Gen. Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsbotham </PERSON>, 55, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was identified Tuesday as the target of a botched car bombing in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. No group claimed responsibility for either attack but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> which is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Home Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON> earlier Wednesday urged the public to be alert for bombing campaigns following Monday's discovery of a car bomb outside <PERSON> Ramsbotham </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s fashionable <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said the bomb, containing a plastic explosive, was placed under the wrong car and fell off because it probably was not attached properly. It was seen on the ground by a painter working nearby who called police. The car bomb bore the hallmarks of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, police said. `` I do not think the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> are respecters of our religions,'' <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. `` I think there is just as much likelihood of there being a dastardly campaign at Christmas as any other time of the year.'' Also Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> railway line reopened after troops searched the track near <LOCATION> Lurgan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, following a bomb warning. The security forces said nothing was found. Train service between the two cities has been disrupted more than 60 times this year because of bombs and bomb hoaxes, blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Bucknell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> faculty says sororities and fraternaties are racist, sexist and anti-intellectual and has recommended abolishing them on campus. The recommendation, adopted 94-46 Monday night, goes before the board of trustees in May. The faculty vote came on a motion by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenks </PERSON>, a librarian, who said the organizations have not made any improvements since 1985, when he also recommended their abolition. His 1985 motion before the faculty was amended to merely recommend improving the organizations. University President <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sojka </PERSON> said the trustees will have a wealth of material to consider before their May meeting. The issue has generated an enormous amount of mail from students, faculty and alumni, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Bucknell </ORGANIZATION> has 13 fraternities and 10 sororities. Fraternities are permitted to have houses, while sororities are not.

 Poles expressed pride and satisfaction at <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s speech Wednesday to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which was carried live nationwide on Polish TV and radio. `` I was really very nervous about him, but he was very good. I am very happy,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON>, speaking from their home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> where she watched the speech with some of their eight children. `` I never dreamed <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> would address the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but I never dreamed about lots of other things that have already happened and things are now happening so fast. I hope everything will be better now and it will be even faster,'' she said by telephone. Mrs. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said that she had spoken with her husband earlier in the day. `` He said he would have a difficult day today. But I am satisfied with him,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in July to represent her husband at a ceremony in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> where he was awarded the first <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Liberty Medal. It has been a year of triumph for the electrican who helped found the independent Solidarity trade union in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> nearly nine years ago and guided it through the difficult years after it was crushed during the 1981 martial-law crackdown and later banned. Solidarity was legalized for the second time in April, and candidates backed by the movement scored a landslide victory in partially democratic legislative elections in June. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then engineered the parliamentary coalition that led to the election of his close adviser, <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, as the head of the first non-Communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, as the Solidarity group of deputies and senators is called, watched the speech in the main chamber of the Polish legislature. Elsewhere, hundreds of people gathered around TV sets in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s main train station to watch the speech. `` I think he expressed what many Poles could have expressed. It was the right thing to do and it was a pleasure to listen to him,'' said a police officer who declined to give his name. `` It was very good. You can not add to anything he said because he said everything there was to be said,'' said a construction worker. He said the reaction of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was very positive and hoped the Americans would help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as much as possible. Another viewer also was impressed. `` It was good. We have to do something with the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Communists -RRB-,'' said a young man from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> who stayed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after attending an independent cultural symposium last week in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. The evening TV news later carried excerpts of the speech.

 Battling the bulge while in the public eye has n't been easy, talk-show queen <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> said Wednesday, acknowledging she has regained 17 of the celebrated 67 pounds she lost last year `` You order a side dish and they call 911 on you,'' she told her television audience. Then there was the time <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> ordered apple pancakes in a restaurant and `` read about it in two newspapers the next day.'' <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, who has not revealed either her `` before'' or `` after'' weight, shed her pounds with a liquid protein diet. Exactly a year ago, she showed off a new, svelte self in tight-fitting jeans as her national audience applauded. Her luck with losing was national news and in August, <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>'s face _ superimposed on actress <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON>'s hourglass figure _ graced the cover of TV Guide But on Wednesday, <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, 35, commiserated over the difficulties of dieting with a studio audience loaded with folks on their way up or down the scale. `` Nothing would have pleased me more than to walk off into the sunset in my size 10 <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> jeans,'' she said. `` I said it was going to be a struggle and Lord knows, it has.'' <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> said she's managed to keep most of the weight off by exercise and a diet low in fat and sugar. But she admitted to some mean encounters with sweet-potato pie. `` I have eaten four bowls of Raisin Bran trying not to eat a piece of cake,'' <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> said. `` I still am struggling with ... why I have a weight problem.'' <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> made a final plea: `` If you see me out someplace and I am ordering pancakes _ just let me do it.''

 Police began registering residents' semiautomatic assault weapons under a new city ordinance today, with opponents threatening a court fight. Lawyer <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> was the only person to register a weapon in the first hour. `` I do n't like registering my possessions, but the law requires it,'' said the former chief <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> district attorney. `` I feel more secure at night owning one of these.'' Police have received hundreds of calls from gun owners seeking information on the law. Owners have 60 days to register their guns. The ordinance was introduced in the wake of growing gang activity in the city and mass killings around the nation by gunmen using such weapons. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s sensitivity to the issue was heightened earlier this year when a man with a submachine gun killed two people and wounded three in suburban <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>. Police checked the serial number on <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s AK-47 lookalike rifle and ran a background check on him. He then paid his $ 30 license fee and left. Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, commander of the department's firearms bureau, said he could not estimate how many guns would be registered. `` Maybe I'm optimistic, but I think the majority of the people are going to comply,'' he said. `` If the majority of the people comply, I think it will have an effect.'' But <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, 48, said he suspected many gun owners wo n't register their weapons for fear the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will declare them illegal in the future The ordinance specifically bans the sale of more than 30 models of semiautomatic assault weapons. Federal law controls ownership of fully automatic weapons. Failure to register a weapon already owned _ or possession of a registered weapon with a magazine having more than 20 rounds _ can bring fines of $ 100 to $ 999 and jail terms of 10 days to six months. The weapon would be destroyed upon conviction. A similar bill was defeated in the last session of the Legislature. Gun owners turned out in force to lobby against the ordinance: 297 people signed up to speak against it at a hearing; only 30 asked to speak in support. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed the ordinance Nov. 6 on a 9-4 vote. The Firearms Coalition of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> announced it will file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyfeler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riflemen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s field representative for <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, said his major complaint with the ordinance is that it leaves too much `` subjective interpretation'' of what constitutes an assault weapon. He said it also gives police `` unrestrained authority.'' `` It scares the hell out of me and should scare the hell out of every citizen in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nyfeler </PERSON> said Tuesday. Not so, said ordinance author and Councilwoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` I am hopeful a majority of people in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> who currently own these weapons will understand the wisdom of getting these guns registered,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` It is a very strong conviction of mine that these weapons have no place in our community. They are built as anti-personnel assault weapons. We do n't need them in an urban environment,'' she said. `` I'm convinced it is a technically good bill and can be enforced properly.'' The ordinance specifies 23 models of rifles, seven of pistols and three of shotguns and their variations. It excludes most semiautomatic sporting firearms. After the <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> shootings in March, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> introduced a resolution declaring the council's intention to pass a law restricting or prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic weapons.

<HEAD>Beijing Warns Against Propaganda By Fax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government has ordered offices to intercept and hand over to authorities the `` reactionary propaganda'' being sent by fax machines from Chinese dissidents abroad, an official report said. The report indicates that fax machines are being widely used to send into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> accounts of the military crushing of the pro-democracy movement and of the subsequent crackdown on dissent that contradict government accounts. Millions of Chinese supported the movement for freedom before troops shot their way into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4 to break up the demonstrations, killing hundreds if not thousands of unarmed civilians. The government has called the pro-democracy demonstrations a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' and says the army heroically restored order to the Chinese capital. Dissidents who fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> `` have repeatedly used faxes and other communication tools to spread a large quantity of reactionary propaganda in our city,'' according to the news service. It did not further describe the material being sent into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The government order demanded that city offices, companies and universities prevent the information coming over faxes from spreading throughout the population, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Under the new order, every work unit with a fax must appoint a person to carefully monitor the machine. `` Reactionary propaganda'' must be intercepted, sealed, and handed over to public security officials. The order also stresses the need to explain to expatriate businessmen and other foreigners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that disseminating propaganda against the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government is illegal and unfriendly. Fax machines in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> can be found in hotels, joint ventures and companies that do business overesas. They also have begun to appear in some government offices and academic centers, but there are no official figures on the number of machines in the city. During the spring demonstrations and subsequent crackdown, overseas Chinese used faxes to provide Chinese outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with accounts of events in the capital that were not reported in the official press or distorted by government propaganda. The Foreign Ministry on Oct. 31 accused the French magazine Actuel of an `` undisguised act of subversion against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' for sending by fax imitation copies of the People's Daily written by <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and other dissidents living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The ministry accused the French government of `` conniving at and supporting this hostile act against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in total disregard of the representations made by the Chinese side.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theatergoers have seen so many established actors jump into <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and fall flat that failure has become the expectation. Therefore it is with unusual appreciation that one finds <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Langella </PERSON> in `` The Tempest'' playing Prospero with poetry, rich-voiced grandeur and the wisdom accumulated and tempered by a sensitive elder statesman. `` The Tempest'' opened Tuesday night at the off-Broadway Roundabout Theater. <PERSON> Langella </PERSON> does n't carry the play by himself. B.D. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, in his next assignment after Broadway's `` M. Butterfly,'' is the spirit Ariel. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, wearing only black <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> shorts on his thin frame, looks the epitomy of an other-world sprite. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>'s Ariel adores <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> and trusts that <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> will keep his promise to set him free. <PERSON> Langella </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> who, in the last scene, forgives his enemies, is neither an overbearing father nor a bookish recluse. At the beginning, he talks about his books but acts like a man who has already digested their contents and now is a person of informed action. He loves his daughter, <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, and hates to give her up. He makes it clear, though, that he is putting obstacles in her relationship with her swain so their path to happiness wo n't be so easy that they fail to appreciate it. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> has such an unclouded brow and innocent aspect that she looks younger, not older, than <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>'s 15. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON>, son of the King of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, fall in love at first sight. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittenbauer </PERSON> as <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> seems weak at first, then his voice, as sweet as a young tenor's, grows on one. <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> has caused the tempest that shipwrecked on his island the King of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> -LRB- a hearty <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryland </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON>'s brother who stole the Dukedom of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> from him -LRB- <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisto </PERSON> -RRB-, the King's brother who plans the same maneuver -LRB- <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON>, who saved <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON>'s life -LRB- an avuncular <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stattel </PERSON> -RRB- and another lord -LRB- <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Knutsen </PERSON> -RRB-.

 <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> won a permanent court order Wednesday blocking the release of a 1987 album he says was made in an alcohol haze, then testified that he never agreed to pay the producer's studio costs The former Beatle, who sued producer <ORGANIZATION> Chips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, Ga.-based CRS Records to prevent the release of the album, was the first witness as the trial on the rest of the issues began Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said he went to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> in February 1987 to work with <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> and his part of the agreement was to do the recording sessions and pay for his plane fare and living expenses. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> was to provide the studio and produce the recordings. There was no formal contract, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> owes him $ 146,239 for studio costs and out-of-pocket expenses. `` I felt some -LRB- contractual -RRB- agreement would be reached but it always hinged on if the album was a success,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> testified. `` I had no understanding that any studio time would be billed to me.'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, who has said in court documents that he was under the influence of alcohol during the recording sessions, said after returning home to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and listening to the tapes he decided they needed more work. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> sings on the recordings, but did not play drums. Before he would approve the album, he wanted to overdub his own drumming. Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> did not elaborate on his ruling Wednesday to make permanent the temporary injunction against release of the album. But court personnel said pre-trial evidence indicated that <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> all along had the right to block the record _ under certain conditions. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>'s attorneys have said <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> came to the producer in an attempt to revive his waning music career. Though acknowledging he had not had a hit record in several years, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> testified he was not desperate when he first talked with <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>. `` It was just a move for your career,'' he said. `` I was n't looking for Chips and Chips probably was n't looking for me. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> embarked on a successful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concert tour during the summer, but according to testimony Wednesday, he refused a request by <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> to include songs from the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> sessions in his live shows. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s appearance drew several courthouse employees for a look at <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and his wife, actress <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>. After getting some laughs by asking, `` Is it on?'' as he approached the witness stand microphone, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> was serious during most of his testimony. He appeared annoyed with some questions as his testimomy extended more than an hour, asking the judge at one point: `` Can I speak plainly? This ` yes' and ` no' is impossible for me.''

<HEAD>State Department Says Soviets Shipping Advanced Jet Fighters to Cuba</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has shipped advanced MiG-29 aircraft to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, a move it called `` wholly inconsistent'' with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s stated desire to promote peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We see no legitimate <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> need for such advanced aircraft, and we do not consider this a helpful step,' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, the department's spokesman, who confirmed a report in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. Citing a need to protect intelligence data, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> refused to provide details on when the aircraft arrived in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, how many planes had been shipped and whether <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also provided trainers. But the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said one high-tech combat aircraft _ believed to be the first of a squadron _ was discovered in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> late last month. The MiG-29 was first photographed in crates by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence satellite after delivery to a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port, the paper said.

A single with cheese, ketchup, tomato and lettuce is her favorite.

 Chinese authorities admitted Wednesday that soldiers fired their guns near Japanese golfers last weekend but said it was an accident unrelated to a death threat received by <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> officials. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told Japanese diplomats their investigation showed a few soldiers were `` testing'' their guns at a shooting range south of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, Japanese sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said. The security officials said some bullets strayed onto the course near the ninth and 18th holes, according to the sources, who would not be further identified. Several Japanese golfers reported hearing two bursts of machine gun fire and bullets whizzing by shortly before noon Sunday. They included three employees of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> office on Nov. 9 received a letter containing a bullet and note threatening to kill Japanese in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The security officials were quoted as telling the Japanese diplomats that while the Chinese side took the shooting incident seriously, it was unrelated to the death threat. Chinese authorities instructed related units to take measures `` to eliminate the uneasiness,'' but did not apologize for the incident, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, which had considered withdrawing its staff from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> following the letter and shooting incident, decided to keep them in place, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffenberger </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We decided the situation did n't call for them to be taken back to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pfeiffenberger </PERSON> said. `` We told them to be careful, to be alert to things there, but things are back to normal and work is going on as usual.'' <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has seven employees in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Guangzhou </LOCATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Pfeiffenberger </PERSON> said. He would not say if the note was signed or disclose its contents, but the sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said it read, `` Now that the martial law troops have gone, our time has come. Go back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. From now, we will kill Japanese.'' Soldiers called in under martial law were stationed at major intersections and overpasses in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after the June 3-4 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement of this spring. The last troops were removed Nov. 1, and only a few armed police remain at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the focal point of the protests. In July and August, a group calling itself the `` Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad'' sent letters to several Japanese firms threatening to kill Japanese in retaliation for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` economic invasion'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was $ 3.1 billion last year, according to Chinese figures, but Japanese figures say the surplus was $ 383 million in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s favor.

 Customs Service radar planes, which have experienced problems with their sophisticated computer systems, had mechanical failures this week that almost ruined a demonstration for the agency's new commissioner and the federal drug policy director. Normally, the two <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> P-3 airborne early warning aircraft use their high-tech radar to locate drug-ferrying airplanes. But last Monday, the mission was different. One of the planes was assigned to fly the new <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> _ director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> _ from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for a conference. On the way, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials were to demonstrate the computerized radar system designed especially for detection of drug-smuggling aircraft. According to an account by <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, the difficulties began Sunday night when one of the two aircraft left its base in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on a regular surveillance mission. That plane experienced a failure in the radar system and returned home. Monday morning, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> launched its other P-3 to pick up the officials, but a fluid pump in the cooling system failed in flight. The system pumps vital coolant to the radar components, which can not be allowed to overheat. The plane bound for <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> made an unscheduled landing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in an effort to fix the problem. But to get the part, Customs officials had to fly the plane that was grounded Sunday night to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, so the defective part could be switched. The cooling system in the Savannah-bound plane was fixed, but when the radar was turned on, a spark knocked out the components that let the radar run on high power. So when <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON> got their tour, the radar was on low power, meaning that it's range was reduced from about 250 miles to 80 miles. `` It was picking up a multitude of targets,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said. `` There was no perceptible difference in the way the radar works between high and low power.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` knew there was some concern about the radar. But he had a great trip. He enjoyed it. He learned a lot of useful information.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> is on its way to becoming whole again and the mason who is doing the repair work for $ 1 says he'll have the Pilgrim's historic landing spot back in shape for Thanksgiving. `` I do n't look at it as a job, I look at it as a privilege to preserve something that means a lot to people all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said mason <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> was hired to fix the rock's crack by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> after it put out bids for the work. Since monetary payment is required, he bid $ 1. The work should take one day, he said Tuesday. The rock, which weighs about six tons and measures about 14 feet wide and 6 feet long, is said to be the spot where the Pilgrims first set foot on ground when they arrived from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1620. The crack, which first appeared in the 1770s, was repaired in the late 19th century. For 100 years, that patch-up job has stood up to the tides that occasionally submerge the rock, which stands in a half-enclosed protective structure in the waters off this seaside town. The original mortar used by that mason is deteriorating, however. Town and state officials said they fear that when water seeps into the rock it will freeze and cause the crack to worsen. `` It could happen soon, it could happen in 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, a DEM spokesman. `` We want to be cautious,'' he said. `` It would look terribly embarrassing if it split in half.'' <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> said he would also fix a series of hairline cracks that have developed within the main fracture and in some other areas of the rock. The smaller cracks were caused by the vibrations of the tourist buses that rumble over the road about five feet from the landmark, he said. <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> said he feels lucky to get the job. `` It just makes me feel good,'' he said. `` It's just knowing what it stands for. It's a symbol of freedom and how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> supposedly started off.'' The mason has been instructed not to use high-tech glues or epoxy because scientists want to be able to undo his work without damaging the rock if more substantial repairs become necessary. <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> said he will use a special mortar mixed to match the color and consistency of the 19th century repairs, but he declined to reveal his recipe, beyond `` small pebbles.'' The rock will never be the same boulder the Pilgrim landing party saw, however. The crack originated when the Sons of Liberty attempted to move the rock to the town square and dropped it, breaking the rock in two. They initially used the smaller piece for their town display, but when tourists kept chipping away at the rock, they decided to glue it back to its partner in 1880 and put it back in the water.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman concerned about continued federal support for the arts said Wednesday that conservatives are stirring up controversy over a few questionable art projects to kill the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. `` The right is using <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> as their new <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., during a hearing of his Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on postsecondary education <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a convicted rapist who committed more crimes after failing to return from a prison furlough in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, was used as an issue in last year's presidntial campaign against <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned federal financing of `` obscene'' art and reduced its $ 171 million appropriation for the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> by $ 45,000 this year after learning that federal funds had helped support two artists, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>, whose work was considered obscene. That effort was led by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, whose subcommittee is considering legislation to keep the endowment operating, said, `` Those who want to see NEA unfunded are utilizing the unwillingness of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to explain <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> to get their way.'' He said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would find it easier to take action against the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> than engage in complicated discussions with their constituents about the value of aid that sometimes supports questionable taste. `` The endowment has given out 85,000 grants and run into controversy on 20 of them,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garment </PERSON>, an attorney who helped establish the NEA. He said that NEA `` officials and panels have behaved overall with an admirable sense of responsibility.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, an attorney who opposes federal support of art, argued, `` There is no First Amendment right to be subsidized by the government.'' `` Creative art does not need government subsidies to flourish,'' he said. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, Garment and attorney <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said government aid attract private donors and government refusal to fund art would lead them away. `` There is a real problem that if corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> begins to think of the arts as tainted, the easy way out is to find something else.''

 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s hunters and ranchers will be free to kill bison that stray from northern Yellowstone National Park this winter and as many as 200 of the animals might be killed, the state's wildlife director said today. Last year more than 500 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> bison were killed in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> after they roamed from the park. That was an unprecedented number and prompted outcries from some environmentalists and conservationists. K.L. Cool, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s director of fish and game, said the state and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have agreed that the northern bison herd at Yelowstone should be limited to about 200 to 300 animals, so they can be better managed. Cool and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, superintendent of the park, briefed some congressmen as well as environmental and conservation leaders, on the bison management plan. But <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> told reporters he still has n't determined how the herd will be reduced from the current roughly 400 animals, or how the bison will be kept from roaming onto <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> rangeland this winter. `` On the long haul, trying to herd a buffalo does n't work. <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> are herded where they want to go,'' said <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, adding that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by `` gentle hazing'' and whatever else might work. But Cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any bison that cross into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> until the northern <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> herd is reduced to about 200 animals. `` <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or uncooperative,'' he said. But he said the state legislature has required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the state.

 A previously unknown group calling itself <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Just </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenge </ORGANIZATION> claimed Wednesday it has kidnapped an American and two naturalized West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The claim came in a typewritten statement delivered to a Western news agency along with photocopies of the passports and visas of the three victims. The American's name was given in the documents as <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The brief Arabic statement said she is a publisher-journalist. The documents identified two Germans as <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>, 39, born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and his 7-year-old son <PERSON> Danjel </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The statement said: `` The Organization of Just Revenge announces its responsibility for kidnapping the West German <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> -LRB- born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB- and his son <PERSON> Danjel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> and American publisher-journalist <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for their activities in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' There was no further elaboration in the poorly typed statement, which failed to say when the abduction took place and made no demands. One photocopy showed a visa issued for Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, on Nov. 1 along with an entry stamp by the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security department Nov. 3. The two West Germans also entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Nov. 3 on similar visas, issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> on the same day Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> got hers. The kidnapping claim could not immediately be verified. The American Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been closed since Sept. 22. The West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said it had no knowledge of the abduction before the statement was released after nightfall. `` But the two victims could be naturalized Germans from <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> descent who are not registered with the embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' said a German official who answered the phone at the embassy. He declined to give his name. Not counting the three people mentioned in the claim, there are 18 foreign hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian extremist factions.

 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s hunters and ranchers will be free to kill bison that stray from northern Yellowstone National Park this winter and as many as 200 of the animals might be killed, the state's wildlife director said today. Last year more than 500 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> bison were killed in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> after they roamed from the park. That was an unprecedented number and prompted outcries from some environmentalists and conservationists. K.L. Cool, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s director of fish and game, said the state and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have agreed that the northern bison herd at Yelowstone should be limited to about 200 to 300 animals, so they can be better managed. Cool and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, superintendent of the park, briefed some congressmen as well as environmental and conservation leaders, on the bison management plan. But <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> told reporters he still has n't determined how the herd will be reduced from the current roughly 400 animals, or how the bison will be kept from roaming onto <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> rangeland this winter. `` On the long haul, trying to herd a buffalo does n't work. <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> are herded where they want to go,'' said <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, adding that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by `` gentle hazing'' and whatever else might work. But Cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any bison that cross into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> until the northern <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> herd is reduced to about 200 animals. `` <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or uncooperative,'' he said. But he said the state legislature has required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the state. Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo cause damage to property and they fear the animals will transmit brucellosis _ a disease the interferes with reproduction _ to their cattle. Blood tests have shown that more than half of the bison killed in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> last year had brucellosis, he said. Under the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> plan, bison will be shot in warden-supervised hunts this winter and spring if they leave the park. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on its more than 2.4 million acres.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected claims that reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> spell the demise of socialism and insisted the Communist Revolution `` was not a mistake.'' Speaking to a national student conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said the existence of two Germanys `` has been recognized by the world community'' since the end of World War II and even talk about reunification constitutes interference in the affairs of the two countries. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past week has flatly opposed any suggestion that East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should be rejoined. `` Noting that certain forces in the West try to create the impression that profound changes in socialist countries signify the failure of socialist ideas, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that this was wishful thinking,'' according to the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. It did not specify which forces <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had in mind. In a televised speech that ran almost two hours, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hammered home to students who he seemed to suspect believed otherwise that `` the October revolution was not a mistake.'' Using a persuasive, emotional tone, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> extolled the ideology behind the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and condemned `` people who are trying to find the roots of our troubles not in the distortions of socialism that took place, but in its very nature and principles.'' `` We can not allow dissatisfaction with ourselves, with how we live now, to be transformed into attempts to question our indisputable, universally recognized achievements and the choice of socialism itself,'' he said. That <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> felt the need to come to the defense of the most basic ideological postulates of Soviet society indicated that they are coming under ever wider attack as the country struggles through economic crisis and sees <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc neighbors moving toward multiparty systems. In his remarks about <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which were carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> but not shown on television, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed for the second day in a row concern over Western powers' response to the democratic upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At a meeting Tuesday with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> he denounced calls for `` exporting capitalism'' to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said it was `` useless to clamor about victory in the Cold War, about the disintegration of some or another social system,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The White House said Wednesday it had `` no apologies'' for extolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic woes of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position should not be offensive to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> views the free-market economy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the `` pride of the world and as a good way to reform the economic problems that they are facing. `` We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the rewards that it has offered,'' he added. `` We hold it up as an example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these countries.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, all the actions taken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` have been appropriate and not been offensive and have had the desired effect of offering our support without inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process backward ... We have no apologies or concern with anything that we've done at this point.'' As for the reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said it `` is not a matter of topical politics. Talking about reunification would mean interference in the affairs'' of the two countries, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> moved away from single-party <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule earlier this year. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reshuffled its leadership this month and, in the most striking reform, opened up the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and allowed its citizens free exit. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also liberalized its travel restrictions. Other top Soviet officials joined their president in condemning Western attempts to interpret the instability in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc as signifying the failure of socialism. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said he was surprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in the region as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet policy. `` This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' the Politburo member told a news conference Wednesday. `` We would like to have a common European house based on freedom. If someone interferes in that process, we might go back to the time of the Cold War.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech to the students touched on the widespread alienation from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> among Soviet youth and their slack support for the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s reforms. His statements appeared at least in part to be a response to a recent poll published in the state-controlled press that found 17 percent of Soviet students thought the October Revolution was a mistake. He reprimanded students for `` sleeping through'' the elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies this spring, and warned them that allowing their youthful energy to lead them into pushing for more radical reform could lead to disaster. Despite his support for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s changes, rumors that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to participate in demolition of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall are false, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.

 About one in every two Americans believes that garbage disposal problems rank among the three most pressing issues facing local governments, exceeded only by fighting drugs and providing adequate education, according to a survey released Wednesday by the garbage industry. The poll, released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managagement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said 52 percent of the people surveyed nationally consider ensuring adequate garbage collection is a serious or extremely serious problem for their local officials. That reflected a higher level of concern about garbage collection than for providing affordable housing or expanding police and fire protection, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, president of the trade group that represents waste disposal industry. The survey was conducted by <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> Reports and included telephone or face-to-face interviews of 3,000 people during a four-month period this year. There was a 3 percent margin of error. The survey also indicated that public opposition to incinerators that turn garbage into energy is easing in most parts of the country amid increasing worries about finding places to bury solid wastes. It said that 44 percent of those surveyed nationwide said they would favor locating such incinerator plants in their area, 8 percentage points higher than those reponding similarly in a poll a year earlier. Thirty-six percent of the people opposed such plants and 20 percent said they did n't know. Opposition to burning garbage continued to be greatest in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where a new waste-to-energy plant was favored by only 36 percent of those surveyed, compared to 42 percent who opposed. Even in that region, however, those who favored a plant incrased by 5 percentage points compared to the 1988 survey. The Northeast, however, had the largest percentage of people, 67 percent of those surveyed, who considered garbage collection as a serious or extremely serious issue facing local governments, ranking only behind the battle to curb drug abuse. Garbage collection issues were found to be of the least concern in the central part of the country, where it ranked last among five areas of concern with only 37 percent of the people saying they considered it a serious local problem. In other findings, the poll indicated an increased interest in recycling programs, but it said the public no longer considers recycling `` a simple ` magic bullet' solution'' to the disposal of waste products, said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the trade group's president. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they had participated in recycling cans, bottles or papers and 44 percent said they would buy products containing recycled materials if given a choice, according to the survey. In a related report, the trade group said that as of the end of September, 38 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have enacted some form of waste recycling laws, although in many cases the full requirements do not go into effect until the early to mid-1990s.

 Veterans Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> pledged Wednesday that rural VA hospitals in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and other sparsely populated areas will remain open despite budgetary constraints. `` I have no intention of closing and no intention of making changes that in any way would diminish hospital care in rural areas,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` These kinds of locations must stay.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> testified at a hearing into the delivery of health care to rural veterans. Other witnesses and western state senators complained that rural veterans suffer from a lack of medical personnel, a lack of access to health care facilities and a lack of resources at the rural hospitals since most are unaffiliated with medical schools. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., complained that policy makers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are fundamentally oblivious to the needs of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` They really do n't understand the sense of space and distance,'' he said. Although 95 percent of all veterans live within a 100-mile radius of the nearest VA facility, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> 83 percent of the veterans served by the <LOCATION> Miles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital live more than 100 miles from it. <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has nine centers compared with two in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> noted that in his native <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> three hospitals were within six miles from one another. Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, complained that veterans with non-service-connected disabilities and incomes above $ 16,500 if single or $ 20,000 if married are being denied VA care because of service cutbacks over the last five years. Those `` Class B'' and `` Class C'' veterans are generally provided care when resources are available. The poorer and service-connected disabled _ `` Class A'' _ receive first-priority care. Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Winship </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s medical division said there was no policy decision to cut out the B and C patients. He said the demand for care by Category A patients has `` virtually consumed'' the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s resources.

 The battle-scarred sandstone columns of the Brandenburg Gate, which were the backdrop for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s last stand and a workers' uprising against Communism in 1953, once again tower over the stage of history. The 200-year-old gate, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s most famous landmark, has stood as the symbol of German division for 28 years. With the Berlin Wall quickly crumbling, the gate is being called the symbol of German unity. It also has been the backdrop for much of the television coverage beamed around the world in the past week of fast-moving developments. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has said it is considering opening a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall border crossing at the <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>. There was wide speculation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that an opening would be knocked through the wall Thursday, although there was no official confirmation. The gate _ the size of a five-story building _ remained on the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> side when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The famous Unten den <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> boulevard ends at the gate. On the Western side, the sprawling avenue that leads to the gate was renamed June 17 Street, after the date of the workers' uprising in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1953 that was bloodily crushed by Soviet tanks. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> workers, angered by the nationalization and collectivization policies of the Communist government, began their street demonstrations at the Brandenburg Gate and tore down the red flag from the top of the gate. In the closing days of World War II, Soviet tanks rumbled by the gate as they closed in on <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s bunker in the chancellery. Only a few hundred yards away was the heart of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s government in a small complex on <LOCATION> Wilhelmstrasse </LOCATION>, which also served as the seat of the imperial government. The Reichstag also is not far away. The Brandenburg Gate also marked <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power. Nazi brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the gate when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. Built from 1788 to 1791 by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotthard </PERSON> <PERSON> Langhans </PERSON>, the six-column gate was commissioned by Prussian King <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. When it was built, it opened the road to the region of <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION>, getting its name. The gate was modeled after the Acropolis in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to reflect the king's intention to make <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> a city of learning and arts. On top of the gate is a bronze chariot with the goddess <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>. It was hauled away to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> defeated the Prussians at <PERSON> Jena </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Auerstadt </LOCATION> on Oct. 27, 1806. He marched into <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> through the Brandenburg Gate. The chariot was brought back to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s defeat in 1814. After the Franco-German war in 1870-71, the victorious Prussians made a triumphal return to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the new imperial capital, again through the <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>. The gate was heavily damaged in the last days of World War II and marked the border between the Soviet and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sectors of conquered <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. It was restored between 1956 and 1958. The chariot was repaired and paid for by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> under Mayor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities removed the Prussian eagle and the iron cross from <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>'s staff before mounting it again. In 1963, Communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the gate to prevent President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> from looking into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> when he visited <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and delivered his `` Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech. The gate, the last of the 20 gates to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> still standing, is 66 feet high, 215 feet wide and 36 feet deep.

 A newly approved drug appears to be the first to slow Parkinson's disease, seeming to cut the destructive progression of the incurable brain illness in half, a major study confirms. The research, conducted on 800 people, found that the drug deprenyl helped people who were not yet sick enough to require levodopa, the standard medicine for Parkinson's. The results are similar to a smaller study, conducted on 54 patients, that was published in August. `` It does not stop the disease,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoulson </PERSON>. `` But it may well slow the disease. This may be the first treatment for a neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease.'' Until now, levodopa has been the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment, easing symptoms but not slowing the underlying disease Doctors usually reserve this drug until relatively severe symptoms develop. The incurable disease attacks a region of the brain, causing shuffling gait, difficulty talking and other symptoms. It typically strikes people in their 50s and 60s and affects about 500,000 Americans. The latest study began in 1987 and was scheduled to continue until late next year. However, researchers stopped the study in February because of indications of a dramatic effect from the medicine. When the results were analyzed, doctors found the treatment had reduced the need for levodopa by 57 percent. `` Over 12 years, this might buy 50 percent more time of less impaired disability,'' said <PERSON> Shoulson </PERSON>, who directed the study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. In their report, the researchers wrote that `` the results translate into a delay in the development of disability of nearly one year -LRB- over the two-year study period -RRB- and an extended capacity for full-time employment.'' The study was conducted by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Parkinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at 28 medical centers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. It was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, 399 people with early, untreated Parkinson's disease were given deprenyl, while 401 others received another experimental medicine or dummy pills During the followup, 97 of those who got deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa, compared with 176 in the comparison group. At the start of the study, people's symptoms included mild tremors, stiffness and slow movement. By the time they needed levodopa, they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for themselves. The doctors are not sure how deprenyl works, but they speculated that it somehow slows the underlying disease process rather than simply easing symptoms. The drug, sold under the brand name Eldepryl, was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for routine use in September. The latest study will continue to test the effect of the medicine when combined with levodopa in people with advanced Parkinson's disease. The earlier study with the drug was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parkinson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and published in the journal Science. In another report Wednesday on <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s disease, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> researchers said they have found that implanting genetically altered skin cells in the brains of rats can reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The skin cells were genetically altered to make them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients. The research does not portend a cure for Parkinson's and is not ready for human testing, but it may offer a possible alternative to fetal cell implants, which have proved effective against the disease but which have become mired in political and ethical controversy, scientists said.

 More than 1,000 guerrillas have attacked the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and are peppering the city with rockets and heavy artillery, the government said Wednesday. But the Soviet-backed government denied guerrilla claims of capturing a strategic army stronghold in the mountains west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, whose only road to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remained closed for a seventh day. The cutoff drove up prices of flour and gasoline. Government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said bands of the U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas from a number of groups united to launch the attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the site of a failed rebel attack in March. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that guerrillas were also shelling the road from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in an attempt to close it. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the guerrillas were trying to take a military garrison at <LOCATION> Dolunta </LOCATION>, about 12 miles west of the city. But he said government troops pushed them back. On Monday, the government claimed 10,000 guerrillas were preparing to attack the city. They failed to take <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> earlier this year because they could not unite and lacked experience in launching conventional operations. Also government bombers proved successful at knocking out guerrilla positions, diplomats have said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the Afghan air force bombed rebel artillery in <LOCATION> Samarkhail </LOCATION> and other villages near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. He said guerrillas forces were preparing an attack on <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, a strategic city south of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktiya </LOCATION> province. Both cities are close to the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, where the guerrillas have bases. The government denied a claim that guerrilla forces had captured a government garrison in <LOCATION> Pajak </LOCATION>, 18 miles west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the mountains. Guerrilla-run radio in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> claimed its forces took the stronghold late last week. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said the guerrillas were steadily chipping away at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s security perimeter and the latest battle linked forces west and north of the capital. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the stronghold had not fallen and that military activity in the area was quiet. Soldiers with knowledge of the situation in <PERSON> Pajak </PERSON> said fighting was fierce but that guerrilla forces had not succeeded in taking the garrison. Earlier this week the government fired several Soviet-made Scud rockets to the west along with dozens of smaller rockets. Soldiers with knowledge of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the main road to the Soviet border, said guerrilla forces near the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> tunnel, about 60 miles from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, had closed the highway for the last week. They said more than 3,000 trucks were waiting to come south to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, carrying food, gasoline and weapons. Witnesses from <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> said guerrillas in the area claimed the government was trying to move 800 tanks down the highway in addition to food and fuel. Soldiers confirmed that tanks were being transported to military bases near the capital but said they did not know how many. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, prices of flour went back up to $ 4 for a 15-pound sack, after falling to $ 3.50 last week when the road was open. The government acknowledged the highway had been closed but said it was caused by damage due to mines. Rebel forces closed the highway for 10 days last month, causing prices of flour and gasoline to jump 50 percent. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> completed pulling out its troops in February, more than nine years after sending in forces to support a Marxist regime.

 <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> was elected Wednesday to a sixth term as <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> president and the labor federation reshaped its governing body to include the leader of its newest union, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> was among five new members elected to the 14.1 million-member federation's executive council, a symbolic gesture to cap the union's decision to rejoin the umbrella organization after four decades outside. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, 40, also adds young blood to a council made up predominantly of white men in their 50s, 60s and 70s. A woman and a black union leader also were elected Wednesday, but because of retirements the number of blacks on the 33-member board fell from three to two and the number of women held at three. That comes at a time when some contend that women and minorities are the labor movement's best hope if it is to reverse its organizing setbacks of the past decade. The federation elections came on a day when the convention delegates also heard from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and prepared for a debate Thursday on whether the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> should endorse abortion-rights resolutions. A compromise struck this week will allow for debate on the issue Thursday before the question, which has divided many labor leaders at a gathering whose theme is solidarity, is referred to he Executive Council for further study. The elections of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, Secretary Treasurer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> and the new council members all were by unanimous vote but not before Hispanic labor leaders protested about being excluded from the board at a time of mounting efforts to organize Hispanics. `` Once again the Hispanics have been excluded from the process and excluded from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is an unhappy day.'' Added United Steelworkers international representative <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>: `` I leave this conventiom a disillusioned delegate but not a defeated trade unionist. We will return.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, in thanking the delegates for their support, said: `` I say to you without hesitation or reservation that this is the most exciting, the most inspiring and the most enthusiastic time in modern history to be at the center of everything in the American trade union movement. There is no place on earth I would rather be and there is nothing that I would rather do.'' In addition to <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, elected to the Executive Council were: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` I see myself as a representative of the service industry and of women in the work force,'' said the 43-year-old <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, a miner-lawyer whose union is in the midst of a bitter strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> coal mines in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, won a seat on the board just weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, 51, who is black, replaced <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>, the man he defeated for the presidency of <ORGANIZATION> AFGE </ORGANIZATION>, a 700,000 member union representing federal employees. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON>, 57, took the slot held by his predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, who retired. <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, 73, the longtime <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> APWU </ORGANIZATION> leader who has been the 365,000-member union's president for nine years, became the second leader of a postal union on the board, joining <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Sombrotto </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> today that labor, business and government should form a new alliance to be `` partners and activists'' for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. He also told the labor federation's biennial convention that he would discuiss the importance of trade unions in `` building a free country'' in his Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Steering clear of issues on which his administration and organized labor disagree, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lavished praise on Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and praised the federation for its long active support of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was present as the president spoke. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, speaking a few hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the labor federation's convention, accused the president of praising Solidarity while working to undermine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor unions. `` American workers are entitled to as much support from an American president as workers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other countries,'' the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat said. He also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to intervene in the eight-month <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. But the president focused on Solidarity and the changing face of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Across Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, we see vindication of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to deal with puppet unions controlled by either employers or governments,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has fought for ... freedom around the world, and I will carry that message to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. I also want to talk with President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about the opportunities to move beyond containment in U.S.-Soviet relations _ to find areas of mutual advantage in our relationship.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving to provide more than a half-billion dollars in economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, steps that have the backing of the administration. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I call on the American labor movement, the business community and government to look for ways to support a partnership for progress in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' `` Labor, business and government can and should be partners and activisits for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future,'' he said. Earlier, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is ready to sign a bill raising the minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.25 by April 1991 _ a measure labor helped negotiate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech came a week after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, labor and congressional Democrats struck a deal to raise the hourly minimum wage. That has tempered somewhat the criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by labor leaders, but praise for the president is hard to find among the 800 delegates to the 14.1 million-member federation's biennial convention. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> was unanimously re-elected today to a sixth-two year term. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> was the unanimous choice to continue as the federation's secretary treasurer. `` I am honored that you have moved to keep me on the bridge as we move into the last decade of the tumultuous 20th century,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` There is no place on earth that I would rather be.'' Many union leaders took the convention floor the past two days to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stance on issues ranging from child care and national health care to the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in March refused to block by using his power to name an emergency mediation board. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week gave final passage to a measure creating a congressional study of the strike designed to produce recommendations for a settlement, and the labor leaders said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto would end any pretense of cordiality between the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and the administration. `` He missed a golden opportunity,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to intervene in March. `` He's got another chance now.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Leitz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> representing striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants added: `` That kinder, gentler <PERSON> George </PERSON> better not veto this legislation.'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, called on Bushoward labor by lifting the ban on rehiring the air traffic controllers <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired in 1981 after they struck. `` By any measure of justice, these workers have paid the price for taking actions they felt necessary at the time,'' <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> said in a Tuesday letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I ask you to give us a sign -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- that there is room for clemency in your administration.'' The delegates broke into loud cheering and applause Tuesday when Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Democratic congressional leaders planned to seek another increase in the minimum wage in 1992, a presidential election year `` If he will not sign it, then we we'll just have to get another president after 1992 who will,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who recently referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON>,'' has tempered his criticisms of late, in part because of the minimum wage compromise. `` We have channels of communication that I think are superior to those that we had during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years,'' he said in an interview last week. `` I think you'd have to say any judgment is still pending.'' No such uncertainty clouds labor relation's with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has increased his stature among the union leaders by successfully fighting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s effort to cut capital gains taxes. `` I have considerable and growing admiration for Sen. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> pledged to get a national health care measure to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk next year That promise came as delegates approved an aggressive lobbying effort designed to sway <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and business leaders into a compromise agreement on such a plan.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should meet with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies before _ not after _ his summit next month with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative arm said Wednesday. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` unthinkable'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> without first consulting the other members of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, said the agenda for the Dec. 2-3 shipboard meeting off the island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was likely to be dominated by the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> sources, who demanded anonymity, said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official will meet with the allies in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Dec. 4 to discuss the summit, but it was not yet certain who that would be. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, administration officials have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was considering calling a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> after the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meeting to discuss new political and military strategy for the West. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> sources said contingency plans were being made for such a presidential visit. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> hurriedly scheduled a meeting Saturday of all 12 leaders of the European Community, the Common Market trading bloc, to discuss Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some analysts believe the move was designed to give the community leaders a chance to discuss the developments before the <LOCATION> Bush-Gorbachev </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the political atmosphere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was sensitive. `` There is a great joy and genuine emotion, but there is also a good deal of confusion and concern about where this process will eventually take us,'' he said. `` It is absolutely imperative,'' he said, `` that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president demonstrates a true awareness of the current situation by offering reassurance and predictability to the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` a special responsibility and the international situation demands nothing less than he meet this responsibility.'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> cautioned against a replay of the 1986 summit at <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, between President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which turned into a much more ambitious meeting than had been expected. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived with sweeping arms control proposals that caught the Americans off guard. The allies were furious such discussions took place without consultations. `` Politicians of every stripe in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are agreed there must be no more Yaltas or Reykjaviks,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` The present system would be unable to contain a repetition along these lines.'' <LOCATION> Yalta </LOCATION> refers to the controversial 1945 meeting of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> at which the shape of post-war <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was determined.

 Calling cigarettes `` a form of death,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> proposed legislation Wednesday that would give the government control over tobacco products and finance an anti-smoking campaign. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who was joined in a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference by former surgeon general <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, said he decided against including tough limits on cigarette exports and advertising to increase the chances that the bill would pass. `` The tobacco lobby is still one of the strongest lobbies in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, there's no question about it,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` This is not an attempt to ban cigarettes,'' he said. `` I think we can get a greater degree of support with this approach.'' The legislation, which is still being drafted for introduction later, would call for a total of $ 185 million in federal spending next year on an anti-smoking advertising campaign, grants to states, schools and businesses that promote anti-smoking programs and money to establish a new Center for Tobacco Products. The center would for the first time give the federal government regulatory control over the contents of cigarettes. Packs of cigarettes would be required to carry information either on the package or inside about the various tobacco additives, `` many of which are carcinogenic,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the tobacco industry's main <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was proposing to waste public money to alert people about something they already know. `` Statistics across the board show that 99 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are aware of what the surgeon general has to say about smoking,'' said institute spokeswoman <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>. Requiring cigarette companies to list ingredients on packaging would violate trade secrets, <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said. And a provision of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> bill that would lift a federal prohibition on state-by-state regulation of advertising would create a `` crazy-quilt'' of local advertising restrictions. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who was appointed surgeon general by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, noted how unusual it is for him to agree with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` It's about time that the federal government stood up to be counted on a product that kills 390,000 people every year,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` Cigarettes are the only legal product in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> which, when used as advertised, kills you.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he would try to quit smoking cigars, a habit he has maintained over the years. `` I wish I had never started and I'll do my best to give it up.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will try to keep the bison herd in northern Yellowstone National Park from roaming into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, but conceded as many as 200 of the animals may be shot this winter if they enter the state. The killing of nearly 600 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> buffalo by <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers and hunters last winter and spring prompted sharp criticism from environmentalists and conservationists. K.L. Cool, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s wildlife director, said Wednesday the state is trying to av300 animals, so that they can be better managed and kept out of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> rangeland. Cool and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, superintendent of the park, briefed some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as environmental and conservation leaders, on the bison management plan. But they conceded they have n't figured out how the huge animals will be kept from roaming out of the park, or how the size of the herd will be reduced. `` On the long haul, trying to herd a buffalo does n't work. <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> are herded where they want to go,'' said <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, adding that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by `` gentle hazing'' and whatever else might work. Cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any bison that cross onto <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> state lands until the northern <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> herd is reduced to about 200 animals. Hunters and ranchers will be given license to shoot the animals under supervision from a game warden, he said. `` <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or uncooperative,'' he said. But he said the state legislature has required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the state. Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo cause damage to property and they fear that they will transmit brucellosis _ a disease the interferes with reproduction _ to their cattle. Blood tests have shown that more than half of the bison killed in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> last year had brucellosis, he said. Most of the vast, federally-owned <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> park lies in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> but its northern end extends into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> does not allow the shooting of stray bison. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on its more than 2.4 million acres. But only the northern, or <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, herd, poses a concern to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers. Because of a series of mild winters and other factors, the northern bison herd grew to more than 900 last year year and most of them roamed along the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where 569 of the animals were killed last winter and spring. That number was unprecedented and prompted criticism from conservationists and environmentalists. Buffalo have roamed onto <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> lands for years, but not nearly in the numbers that left the park last winter. According to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> officials, 190 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> buffalos were killed in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in 1984 through 1988. <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will try to develop ways to better control the size of the northern herd to keep it below 300 animals. But he said ways to do that `` have n't been worked out.'' He ruled out the possiblity that hunters would be allowed to hunt the bison within park boundaries.

 As many as 7,000 East Germans who fled to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but became disenchanted are expected to return home, a West German TV network reported Wednesday. In recent days there have been reports, some from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, about a possible large return of those who fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in September and October. While those numbers have not been confirmed, it is clear that some refugees are going home now that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have opened borders and promised reforms under increasing pressure for freedom. Communist leaders and opposition groups have urged their countrymen to stay home to take part in reforms. They also have expressed hope some of the 200,000 mostly young people who have fled to the West this year will return. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network said as many as 7,000 East Germans were expected to return, 3,000 less than predicted by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Every day about 30 people knock on the door here and ask to re-enter the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON>, deputy chief of a returnee center in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s northeastern <LOCATION> Buch </LOCATION> district. `` The climate in the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- has gotten colder.'' <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON> predicted the center's capacity of 150 people would be reached soon. About 60 Germans disappointed with capitalist life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> reportedly arrived at the center Wednesday. Contrary to the past, `` we are trying everything'' to simplify procedures for regaining East German citizenship, <PERSON> Heyn </PERSON> said. A 48-year-old warehouse worker said he left <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a few days ago after four years, feeling `` totally disappointed.'' `` I was allegedly too old for a job,'' he said, requesting anonymity. `` It was n't for me. I wanted to come back mainly because of the security, which I missed quite a bit in the Federal Republic.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which said it was bracing for a return wave of up to 10,000, opened four reception centers along the border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Authorities in cities such as <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> readied emergency shelters in military barracks, schools and dormitories. West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said that while buses were on standby, no major organized return was planned for the moment. Officials said a flow back to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be difficult to document since many would simply return to their homes and most had become West German citizens, meaning they are not registered when leaving the country. A major outflow is expected from <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, which borders on southern <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news service said. East German officials say the government will loan each returnee 150 marks in immediate aid and 15 marks for each day of unemployment. The 150 marks is about one-tenth of a worker's average monthly wage

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern Wednesday about recent fighting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and urged various factions to return to the negotiating table to seek a political settlement. The statement came on the eve of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> vote on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s seat at the international body. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is expected to confirm retention of the seat by an opposition coalition that includes non-communist factions backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There has been military activity by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other elements in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, a department spokesman. `` We regret the return to the battlefield in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and we support all efforts to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible.'' `` A comprehensive settlement, which we think is still needed, will require agreement among the Cambodian facions and the other involved parties on the formation of an interim coalition authority,'' he said. Last summer, a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> peace conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> dissolved over the failure to reach agreement on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in an interim government. Under leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed more than one million people before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which installed a puppet government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, said its occupation troops have been withdrawn as of Sept. 31. Last week, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> became the first Western nation to acknowledge that Vietnamese forces are no longer in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The Chinese, who have supplied the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and the non-communist opposition coalition contend Vietnamese troops remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> disguised as Cambodians. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is continuing restrictions on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ability to send weapons to non-communist factions, according to congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The restrictions, adopted over the administration's objections, prevent the president from using contingency funds from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to arm the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves the action first.

 Through what was called `` a miracle of international cooperation,'' three of four fingers were reattached to a Polish sailor's hand, more than two days after they were severed in a shipboard accident. Dr. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chow </PERSON>, director of replantation and chief of the microvascular surgery team at the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the fingers were not reattached to the hand of <PERSON> Zbyskyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON> for more than 54 hours. This appears to be a record because the longest time previously known between this type of accident and reattachment was 39 hours, said <PERSON> Chow </PERSON>, who coordinated the surgery. The accident occurred aboard the Greek freighter, SS Success, on Nov. 6 some 500 miles off <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON>'s hand was caught under falling machinery, doctors said. <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON>, 39, suffered what <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> characterized as `` a severe crush-amputation'' injury that severed the four fingers of the left hand where they meet the palm. The ship captain received emergency advice from Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultze </PERSON>, head of the emergency room at <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VII </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. That included immersion of the digits in a saline solution and keep them cool but not frozen. Paramedics on the ship gave <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON> emergency first-aid and doctors on <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> contacted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which called <LOCATION> Chow </LOCATION>, the doctor said. `` Right then time was important,'' <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> said. `` The ship was two days away from where it could meet a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter that could take the sailor to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. ... It was a miracle of international cooperation.'' Once the freighter reached the rendezvous point, <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter. <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON> received emergency treatment in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and the Greek shipping company authorized a private air ambulance to fly the sailor to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The surgery, performed on Nov. 8, took nearly 15 hours, <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> said. All of the severed digits except for <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON>'s index finger were able to be saved. <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> said the prognosis for a full recovery by his patient was excellent. He said that although the sailor was still hospitalized, he has made a fist and straightened his damaged fingers. <PERSON> Kajowski </PERSON> will be able to return to sea, <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> said, and should be able to perform all the duties he could in the past.

<HEAD>Policy Requires Teachers, Counselors to Report Sexually Active Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new state law on child abuse has prompted <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s largest school district to enact a policy requiring teachers and counselors to report to police the names of sexually active students. The legislator who co-sponsored the child-abuse law said reporting sexually active students was n't her intent and she'll work to revise the measure `` We rewrote the law to bring the state's child abuse reporting laws up to federal specifications,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` We never thought it could be construed as it has been in the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> district.'' In the meantime, school officials say some students wo n't talk to them about such problems as pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, knowing a police investigation might ensue. `` The youngsters tend to clam up when we tell them we can no longer promise confidentiality,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Principal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curlett </PERSON> said. `` They will turn to their friends for help, and when it comes to advice about subjects like communicable diseases, that would be disastrous.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dobson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> counseling director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlene </PERSON>, said the policy probably will deter some students from seeking counseling. `` This policy does more to scare than to help our students,'' he said. Changes made this year in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s child-abuse reporting statute require schools to report to police any student who they have reasonable grounds to believe has been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual conduct with a minor, sexual assault, sexual molestation, commercial sexual exploitation of a minor, incest or child prostitution. The previous law required reporting only in cases of sexual molestation. However, as interpreted by <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> schools and <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> police, school officials must inform police of any and all sexual activity. The <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> district has 61,700 students and covers most of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, parts of two other <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> suburbs, and the Salt River Indian Reservation. `` Our interpretation of the law is that the school district must report all sexual activity among students, and then it is up to the police to determine if it is a situation in which there is reasonable grounds to believe a minor has been abused,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> police spokesman. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said that if two 15-year-olds are kissing and fondling each other under the bleachers, and a teacher sees them, the teacher is obligated under the new law to report the incident to police for investigation. The number of child abuse reports to police by school officials has n't increased since the district policy went into effect in September, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoglund </PERSON>, assistant superintendent of the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> district, said the problem is in the wording of the legislation. `` We believe we are forced to comply with the letter of the law, even though we do not believe it was the intent,'' <PERSON> Skoglund </PERSON> said. However, officials from the neighboring <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION> districts said they interpreted the law differently. They said their reporting procedures have n't changed and that police are only called in instances of obvious abuse.

<HEAD>Old Times at White House: President Reagan, Vice President Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was like old times Wednesday as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, returned to the White House for the first time for the unveiling of their official portraits. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred repeatedly to his predecessor as `` Mr. President.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called him `` George'' and, in a tribute to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s past role as understudy, `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confided that he had a little difficulty adjusting to their changed circumstances. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked to the crowd of 100 former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials and other VIPs gathered in the East Room: `` When the announcer here said, ` Mr. President,' well, I fell back to where I comfortably was for eight years. It seemed most appropriate.'' It was n't the day's only honor for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans named their campaign committee's headquarters the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, attending the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> ceremony, noted it was n't the first time he had been so honored. `` There is another building named for me. It's a saloon in ... Ireland,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the outdoor gathering of 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> partisans at the dedication ceremony. At the conclusion of the ceremony, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and wife were presented with a watercolor of the building. `` Now,'' he said, `` I can replace the photograph of the saloon.'' The White House portraits of the Reagans were painted by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is shown on a 50-inch-high canvas in a blue suit and red tie, his fingers on his Oval Office desk, a bookcase and a bronze cowboy statue behind him. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is depicted in a full-length red gown, standing in profile before the closed mahogany doors outside the State Dining Room. Both Reagans beamed as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showered them with praises, saying their portraits will hang in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to `` remind future generations about two of its greats.'' He called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` one of the most beloved presidents in the history of the Republic,'' and said he deserves more credit than anyone else for the democratic changes taking place around the world. The painting `` reflects the qualities that make him so special _ kindness, gallantry, decency and humor,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He praised <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for her beauty, taste and anti-drug crusade and said, `` Over the years there have been many wonderful presidents and first ladies. But thanks to you, I do n't believe this place has ever had a better team.'' `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, do n't fail to take a look,'' quipped <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he got to speak. `` They're sure different than a lot of those cartoons we had to put up with.'' The former president, now living in retirement in <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, called it a `` very special day in <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s and my life.'' `` Incidentally, I want to say here with the very kind things that <PERSON> George </PERSON> was saying: I think attention has to be called to the fact that whatever we accomplished, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a major part of everything we did.'' `` Maybe it's because my staff is a bit smaller now than it used to be, but I ca n't really find the words to express how I feel to be back here in this house,'' said the 78-year-old <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his graying hair back almost to regular length following surgery in September that caused him to shave it off. `` There are really no words to convey what it means to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and me to be here, to walk in these hallowed halls again,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Petrie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> commissioned the paintings and donated them to the White House. <PERSON> Shikler </PERSON> redid <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s portrait after Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed disappointment with the first. <PERSON> Shikler </PERSON> also did the White House paintings of the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s portrait will hang on the State Floor with other 20th century presidents. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 44-inch-high canvass will hang on the ground floor corridor with portraits of other recent first ladies. With the ceremony over, as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> band began to play outside the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned to the microphone for one last anecdote. He recalled how once at a state dinner for <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> had escorted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> off to her table but Mrs. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> just stood there and `` said something to me in French which I did n't understand.'' `` Then the interpreter caught up with us and told me what she was saying. I was standing on her gown!''

 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> reopens Saturday, restoring the key link between two cities battered by a major earthquake that forced harried commuters onto trains, ferries and buses. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials had hoped to open the bridge by Friday, exactly one month after a 50-foot section of the span's upper roadway dropped onto the lower during the Oct. 17 quake, claiming one life. They almost made it. But two days of foggy nights created enough moisture to interrupt stripe painting on the 53-year-old bridge, which carried more than 260,000 vehicles every working day prior to the quake. Vehicle traffic will start moving across the 8.5-mile span as soon as possible after midnight Friday, according to <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachtold </PERSON>, regional director for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Hikers will get a chance to try the bridge even earlier _ at $ 5 each. Thousands are expected to take part Thursday, with proceeds going to pay for buses to take them to the bridge. Anything left over will go to quake relief. Although many are expected to return to their autos, there are some who will continue to use mass transit. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Scauzzo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, about 30 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, switched to <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> after years of using his car. `` But no more,'' he said on Wednesday. `` Now I'm going to continue -LRB- riding the train. -RRB- My biggest problem is figuring out the tickets.'' But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a federal employee, is a commuter who thinks <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> is too limiting. `` BART only goes to certain places. Time is important to me. I think with my car I can increase my work production time two or three times.'' <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> officials announced last week they hoped to reopen the bridge on Nov. 17, one month after the 15-second quake struck <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at 5:04 p.m., killing 66 people and causing $ 7 billion in damage. The earthquake also interrupted the World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>, an event symbolized by the bridge on T-shirts and other memorabilia. The department originally predicted the span would reopen around Thanksgiving. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Rigging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION>, one of the repair contractors, said planning alone for such a job usually takes a month. `` Here, we had to do it right on the spot,'' he said. `` You have to make a lot of judgment calls fast and every one of them has to be right.'' The first step was to make sure the damaged decks did n't fall through to the bay. Working 12-hour shifts, crews cut the damaged upper deck into two pieces, then used a crane to lower them to a barge below. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> devised a hydraulic jack to pull the bridge back together. The quake had pulled the eastern approach about seven inches toward <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>; the bridge moved back two inches after the shaking stopped. `` We had to make it ourselves,'' he said, adding that the jack pulled about 10 million pounds of weight back toward <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The next major steps involved installing new girders, placing 20 new I-beams, lowering 42 precast deck sections and then pouring concrete between them. Repairs were done using a technique first employed in the 1950s when train tracks were ripped from the lower deck. `` That was when we first used prefabricated concrete sections,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McDouglad </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION>' local chief of maintenance. The bridge collapse forced thousands of commuters to abandon their beloved cars for Bay Area Rapid Transit trains, a hastily assembled ferry fleet or buses. Commuters who insisted on driving added many extra miles, taking roundabout routes over still-useable bridges in other parts of the region. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and Bachtold on Tuesday walked to the spot where the bridge snapped. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he hoped people who used mass transit during the closure would stick with it. `` The nation ca n't afford the single occupant vehicle,'' he said. `` There are going to be tremendous traffic problems for at least a year because of earthquake damage,'' said <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. `` It seems like an excellent time to get reliable, timely public transportation in place.''

 The 20-foot obelisk known as the white supremacy monument was taken apart and moved Wednesday from the foot of Canal Street to a warehouse. The Streets Department says the monument, erected in 1891 to commemorate a white uprising which overthrew the Reconstruction government in 1874, is being moved on advice of engineers for traffic improvements. The National Association for the Advancement of White People, which founder and former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> imperial wizard <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> calls a white civil rights group, initially objected to moving it. It is inscribed with the names of 16 members of the White League who died in the 18-minute battle. An inscription praising white supremacy was added in 1932, and white supremacy groups have rallied near the monument for decades. The <ORGANIZATION> NAAWP </ORGANIZATION> complained to state and national preservation officials, who worked out an agreement under which the city may store the monument for 18 months, but must put it back up by May 1, 1991, within two blocks of the original site.

 Sheriff's deputies posing as students spent six months in high schools looking for drug use, but came up empty-handed. `` It's great news,'' <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools spokeswoman, said Tuesday. `` It really gives a strong picture of the teachers and administrators and the kids.'' Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the operation was planned in August 1988 after a school district survey showed an alarmingly high amount of drug use by young people outside the schools. The sheriff recruited an undisclosed number of officers to mingle with students in the county's three high schools last spring and this fall. The officers fooled students and teachers, by doing homework, going to football games and hanging out with students. But they failed to make a single drug purchase, officials said. `` We're not denying there's a drug problem, but we're saying we're being successful at keeping it out of the schools,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` It shows a lot of the drug education and concern by the schools and the sheriff's department is starting to pay off.''

<HEAD>State of Siege Declared, 700 Arrested</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government declared a 3-month state of siege Wednesday and rounded up at least 700 teachers and labor leaders a day after negotiations with striking teachers broke down. Three teachers were in critical condition after a 24-day hunger strike and were rushed to private clinics where they were placed under intensive care. Many of the teachers and unionists who were arrested were sent to detention centers in the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> tropics, said Undersecretary of the Interior <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Loayza </PERSON>. The state of siege allows police to arrest and hold someone without charge for 48 hours without a judicial order. Rules governing public meetings and other activities must be determined by state governments. The center-left government of President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said it acted to guarantee peaceful local elections next month. The hunger strike ended with the state of siege and most schools were open Wednesday for final exams. There was little police presence in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> and other cities, and business and commercial activity was normal. Power stations in La Paz were guarded by soldiers but no violence was reported. The move came a day after salary negotiations between the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, representing the country's 80,000 public schoolteachers, broke down. The teachers, who earn $ 75 a month, have been demanding a $ 103 bonus to compensate for cost of living increases. Hundreds of teachers joined the strike to pressure <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s government to provide the bonus. The government says it can not afford to pay the bonus because of the state of the economy. Education spending takes up 18 percent of the country's budget. In recent days, teachers and students clashed with police in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, and the government closed schools two weeks ago when tens of thousands of workers marched in support of the teachers. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s government, trying to maintain an austerity plan, said in the state of siege decree that the illegal strike created `` a climate of social unrest with demands that the state can not attend without risking the economic and financial stability of the country.'' The decree said it guarantees the campaign activities of political parties for the municipal elections scheduled for Dec. 3, and that the balloting `` must take place, for which it is necessary to preserve the political rights of citizens and political parties.'' The minimum monthly wage is $ 25. The cost of living, meanwhile, is one of the highest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with the prices of poultry and dairy products comparable to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, pledged to maintain stability after taking office Aug. 6 and has continued austerity measures of the previous government. The measures include a wage freeze and lower government spending to combat a 1985 annual inflation rate of 24,000 percent. The rate has since dropped to 12 percent, and the economy is expected to grow by 2.5 percent this year after years of decline. In response to a general strike, the previous government also declared a 90-day state of siege after 45 days in office.

 A policeman who fatally shot a black motorcyclist acted recklessly and in defiance of police regulations, prosecutors said Wednesday as the trial opened into two deaths that touched off racial violence in January. Defense attorneys said their client shot in self-defense. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> 31, faces two manslaughter counts in the slayings of the driver, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, who died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed after the shooting. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told the racially mixed jury that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> violated police regulations when he stepped into the street and fired at <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION>. `` This shooting was not justified,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` At the time <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired the shot, he was in no danger of being struck by the motorcycle.'' Testimony will show, he said, that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired at the motorcycle as it was about to pass him, not hit him. `` It was not a life-or-death situation, it was not a split-second decision and he did not have to shoot,'' the prosecutor said. But defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> acted not out of racism, but in self-defense as the speeding motorycle headed directly at him to escape a pursuing squad car. He said no one the night of the shooting could see each other well enough in the <LOCATION> Overton </LOCATION> neighborhood to determine skin color. `` Officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> did not shoot his gun because he is Hispanic,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> did not die because he was black.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot only because the motorcycle, driven by a desperate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, was about to run into him, the defense contends. `` He had a second, a half second, to make a decision to save his life,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> cleared the last barriers to the trial by rejecting defense contentions that the threat of violence hung over the trial and could frighten jurors into convicting <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> to avoid another riot. The six-member jury is made up of two blacks, one Hispanic and three whites. The alternates are two Hispanics and two whites. The shooting took place Jan. 16 as the Colombian-born <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and his partner were stopped on a street in the predominantly black <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, talking to the victim of a minor crime. As they talked, another squad car was chasing down a speeding motorcycle driven by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and carrying <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. When the motorcycle turned onto the street where <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was standing, the officer fired one shot from his police weapon, killing <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing into a car. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died later. One of the prosecution's star witnesses, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, testified later Wednesday that he had been talking to <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and his partner about his stolen license plate tag when the shooting occurred. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he spotted the motorcycle and called it to the attention of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who was looking for a theft form in the trunk of his police car. `` He went a few steps and put his radio up,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` He took a few more steps with his weapon. He aimed it in that general direction. ... I ducked. When I ducked, I heard the shot,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He estimated the motorcycle was going at 50 or 60 miles per hour. But on cross examination by <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> admitted he had given a higher speed in his initial statements to police and he also acknowledged telling police he could not determine if the motorcyle was heading directly for <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. Within an hour after the shooting, an angry crowd of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> residents had gathered and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles. The violence quickly spread into a three-day riot during the week leading up to the Super Bowl in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The disturbances left one looter shot to death, 11 people injured by gunfire and 13 buildings burned down. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was later found to have high levels of alcohol and THC _ the active chemical in marijuana _ in his bloodstream at the time of his death. He also had 5.5 grams of marijuana and $ 1,500 in cash in his pocket, facts the defense contends shows he was a drug-crazed dealer desperate enough to run down a policeman to avoid arrest and more jail time. The city later set up a commission to examine the roots of the racial disturbance, the fourth to hit <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the 1980s. The previous disturbances were sparked by the killing of black men by officers or the officers' acquittals on similar charges. If convicted on both counts, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> faces up to 60 years in prison.

<HEAD>Police Seek Permanent Barricades Around Dealers Haven</HEAD>

 Police want to permanently barricade streets surrounding a 12-block area in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> plagued by drive-through drug dealing and gang violence. `` This would make this area a vastly safer community for the law-abiding people who live there,'' police Cmdr. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Why should they be subjected to the danger and the shootings that go along with drug activity when there is something that can be done about it?'' The blockade plans include a guard station to be built and staffed using donations by apartment owners in the Sepulveda-area neighborhood. A meeting of residents and city officials is planned for January to try to work out details. Sawhorse barricades were first erected there last week and police increased patrols in the heavy drug-dealing area, limiting entry to residents and their guests. The effort has been so successful at curbing crime that police want to make it permanent, said Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The plan must first go to the City Council, which holds the authority to close city streets to the general public, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>, an assistant city attorney. Councilman <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachs </PERSON>, who represents the area about 15 miles northwest of downtown, introduced a measure Tuesday that would keep the temporary blockades in place as long as police see fit, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>, a Wachs aide. The council will consider <PERSON> Wachs </PERSON>' measure next week. Originally, the blockades were allowed by a 30-day permit obtained from the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> because of police claims that there was an unusual danger to the public and property in the area. Police barricades on streets plagued by crime were first used in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> three years ago on a three-block stretch of road in <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION>. Roadblocks have also curtailed drug dealing in the <LOCATION> Pico-Union </LOCATION> area near downtown. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, police last year permanently barricaded several streets to limit access to the suburb. They since have reported a noticeable reduction in the number of burglaries.

<TEXT>
 Increasingly, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public has come to believe there is political bias in news coverage, a new survey finds. Despite that _ and a belief by 63 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public that news organizations fuel controversies _ a favorable view of those organizations is expressed by 82 percent for network TV news, 80 percent for local television news and 77 percent for daily newspapers, said the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> survey released Wednesday. Among network big names, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> `` is now the most highly regarded of the television correspondents,'' according to the poll. While his believability rating topped his network rivals, it dropped five points from its 1985 level. CBS' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> lost 10 believability points, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> 9 points, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> 7 points At the other end of the believability scale was <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> whose rating dropped 48 points between the two surveys. The survey, conducted among members of the public, media, government, academia and business, is the first work of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The Press. `` Believability is down, there's just no question about it,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an associate professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and associate director of the survey. `` On the average, news organizations lost nine points on a sale of 100 in terms of believability,'' he said. The survey's rating scale includes four categories ranging from the top -LRB- you can believe all or most of what the person says -RRB- to the bottom -LRB- believe almost nothing -RRB-. Counting the percentages of respondents ranking news people or organizations in the top two categories, the top of the list reads: <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> 85 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> 84 percent, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> 83 percent, <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> 81 percent and Rather and <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> 79 percent. At the bottom is <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> at 26 percent. Other names and organizations include <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> at 75 percent, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> 74 percent, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> 71, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> 70, and columnist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> 59. By comparison, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> gets a rating of 70 percent, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 63 percent, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> 47, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> 33, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> 29 and businessman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> 25. `` The most interesting case, bar none for me, is <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> is the only news organization that has sustained no decrease in believability.'' The reason, he said, is that <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> concentrates on hard news. `` It does n't do a lot of interpretation, does n't do a lot of watchdoggery, it just shows hard news, particularly the sort of news the public is most interested in.'' The Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings include the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Sun. It also includes a cable television division. Pollsters said that since <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> began its research program five years ago, there has been a `` significant erosion of public confidence in the press as an objective reporter of the news and as an impartial observer of the political and social scene.'' In 1985, 53 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public believed news media favored one side in dealing with social and political issues. That percentage remained in the 50s in five subsequent surveys and rose to 68 percent in the current one. Similarly those who believe news organizations `` deal fairly with all sides'' dropped from 34 percent to 28 percent. When the press respondents were asked whether news organizations merely report the news or fuel controversies by their coverage, 46 percent opted for the first and 49 percent for the second. `` Drive controversy'' also got the nod from 75 percent of the academics, 80 percent of business leaders and 77 percent of government leaders. Not surprisingly, members of the news media _ 81 percent _ said they cover stories about the personal and ethical behavior of politicians very or fairly responsibly. Only 68 percent of the general public and 60 percent of government leaders agreed. The percentage of people who think news organizations get their facts straight rose to 54 percent from a low of 40 percent a year ago. And there was a slight increase in the percentage of those who believe the press respects people's privacy _ from 14 percent last year to 23 percent. The survey found that the media consistently overstate interest in news stories. In eight of nine stories cited, the media thought the public was more interested than the public said it was. The greatest overstatements of public interest were on stories about <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson-Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> divorce and former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the survey said. News about the scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> was the only instance in which the press correctly gauged the very low level of public interest. Sixty-four percent of the members of the public surveyed said they read a newspaper nearly every day, while 67 percent said they regularly watched a network news show. A total of 508 media telephone interviews were conducted Aug. 3-Sept. 29, while 275 interviews were conducted with leaders in business, government and academia Aug. 3-Oct. Nearly 100 interviews were conducted with government leaders, including 38 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 12 senaors, nine governors, 21 mayors and 16 senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. There were 100 interviews with presidents and journalism deans at major colleges and universities. The Gallup Organization conducted a telephone survey of 1,507 adult members of the public Aug. 9-28. The margin of error ranged from 3 percentage points for the largest sample to 11 percentage points for the smallest.

 AIDS activists say <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was trying to profit from a government-subsidized research program by charging patients for AIDS drug studies in which participation is free around the country. `` What <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> is doing is wrong,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schram </PERSON>, former chairman of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> City-County AIDS Task Force. `` They are using this study as a way to make money and in my opinion that is inappropriate. `` Experimental drug treatment programs are federally funded and they are supposed to be free.'' Critics claim the medical school, part of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, charged patients a $ 260 consultation fee to determine their eligibility for the study. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS Clinical Trials unit is one of 46 research facilities nationwide participating in the study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases to examine the effects of experimental AIDS drugs such as AZT and DDI. Federal health officials said research groups have the option of charging fees, but believe that <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> is the only program that does. `` I've never encountered it before,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON>, director of the AIDS program for <ORGANIZATION> NIAID </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, co-investigator of the clinical trial group at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the program charges fees because the screenings are part of a larger evaluation designed to determine options in treatment. `` The time that we spend with someone in the clinic is not specifically for participation in the study,'' he said. `` We discuss much, much more than just the study, such as why they might want to continue taking AZT or why they ca n't, and we consider it a medical consultation.'' He added that after candidates are chosen, treatment is free. To be eligible for the program, a patient must test positive for the AIDS virus and never have been treated with <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION>. The program is composed of three separate studies to determine the effectiveness of <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION>, in comparison to AZT. <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION>, or dideoxyinosine, and AZT, now known formally as zidovudine, both inhibit replication of the AIDS virus. AIDS activists claim the program should be free because patients put their health at risk by taking an experimental drug. They also claim the fee excludes poor patients who could benefit. `` There is already a problem with minorities and poor people getting experimental drug treatments and this will make it that more difficult to get access to those drugs,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>, a spokesman for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.

 A Christian leader accused Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Wednesday of obstructing peace efforts, and the army commander replied that Christians who support a Syrian-backed plan should have their throats cut. `` We've tried all means to liberate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from foreign forces throughout the 14 years of war, but we have n't succeeded,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political group. `` The national reconciliation charter is a peace offensive to liberate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> without bloodshed,'' he said in an interview, referring to a plan devised by legislators at a three-week meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` I do n't understand why he -LRB- <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> -RRB- does n't want to give peace a chance,'' <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, 57, said in his home village of <LOCATION> Shibtine </LOCATION>, 27 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He was interviewed after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units, declared: `` Those who support the Arab solution deserve to have their throats and tongues cut. ... We are not going to be lenient with them.'' Shiite Moslem militias allied with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> battled in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums for a second night Wednesday. Police said two people had been killed and 11 wounded since fighting began Tuesday between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Iranian fundamentalist group, and the more moderate Amal, allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are rivals for supremacy among the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million people. <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, also leads the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> groups and is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. He was the main Christian negotiator in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> last month on the plan to end the sectarian civil war, which has cost more than 150,000 lives. Parliament ratified the accord, known in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as the national reconciliation charter, on Nov. 4 during a session in Syrian-controlled north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that also chose <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, a Christian, as president. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the Taif accord because it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, whom he describes as an occupation force. Syrian troops are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an Arab League mandate granted in 1976, the year after the civil war began. They and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces fought a six-month artillery war that killed hundreds of people, nearly all civilians, before the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> arranged a truce in September. The 54-year-old general, who had led a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> since September 1988 that competed with a Moslem government, decalred <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> dissolved in an attempt to stop ratification of the peace plan. Legislators convened in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because he threatened to shell the Parliament building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He also claimed <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was elected illegally, but <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> said Wednesday `` the election of President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> is 100 percent in line with the constitution.'' <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> has designated Sunni Moslem politician <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who led the Moslem government in competition with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s, as prime minister to form a national reconciliation government on the basis of the Taif accord. A major goal of the peace agreement is to give Moslems a greater share of power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where they now make up 55 percent of the population. Christians were in the majority when the country became independent of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943 and have controlled the government, judiciary and army. In his capacity as caretaker finance minister, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> instructed the ministry and central bank Wednesday to allow only <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> to withdraw presidential funds, which <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had been using. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone the order was intended to `` stop <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from withdrawing from the presidency's account Now we have a president. He is the only one who has the right to control this account.''

<HEAD>Court Challenge Weighed On Pa. Abortion Controls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s passage of the nation's strictest abortion controls raises the possibility of a court challenge, but abortion rights advocates were uncertain Wednesday whether a lawsuit would help their cause The bill, which Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> is expected to sign within days, was drafted to conflict directly with provisions in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling, which established abortion as a constitutional right, leading supporters have said. Abortion rights activists were in a quandary because an attempt to overturn the bill's provisions might open the way for appeals that could weaken <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> further. In July, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave states greater leeway to restrict abortions; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s law would be the first to take advantage of that. `` We're not going to waltz blindly into any traps. At the same time, we're going to fight as aggressively as you could imagine to strike down the parts of this bill that violate women's constitutional rights,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Frietsche </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrenda-Roberts </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood-Pennsylvania Affiliates, predicted a suit would be filed, but suggested it would be structured in a way that would not necessarily endanger <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Any legal action was not expected for at least several weeks. But abortion opponents said the abortion rights camp would take significant risks in challenging the new provisions. `` The pro-choice side is in a Catch-22 position. If they allow the bill to stand, we've got a good bill in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. ... If they do n't challenge, clearly other states will look at this legislation and say, ` We'll at least get this much.' That's not in their interest,'' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Neary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> To </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed Tuesday, would represent the most restrictive abortion controls in the nation. It would require women to notify their husbands if they plan to get an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the fetus' sex; ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except in cases where the mother faces death or irreversible harm; and establish a 24-hour waiting period. Also, doctors would be required to inform a woman of the likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the risks and alternatives. The proposal would regulate the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses. Abortion rights advocates say the prohibition on sex-selection abortions is in direct conflict with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on restrictions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Another potential clash is the spousal notification, which pro-choice leaders have labeled unconstitutional. A third area of dispute could be the 24-week provision, which would place a ban on abortions during a period that the court has permitted limited restrictions. The purpose of the sex-selection ban `` is to overthrow <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> completely and allow state legislatures to ban abortion at any time for any reason and do away with the trimester system,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hrenda-Roberts </PERSON> said. A leading pro-choice legislator, Republican state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, predicted that if provisions are challenged and upheld, `` Then the dam is open.'' `` My instincts are that we are probably better off not having this becoming the case to challenge <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, I think it is inevitable that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will, in one way or another, rule on all these matters. It's just a matter of time.''

 Homeless protesters who had taken over an ornate room of the Statehouse were arrested Wednesday shortly after saying they would not be moved until $ 700,000 in budget cuts were restored to the winter shelter program. The vigil, held in memory of one of their own who died after spending a night on <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> last winter, ended with the arrest of 20 people about an hour after it began. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valkenburg </PERSON> and more than 100 others moved into Nurses Hall promising, `` I will not move.'' All of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct, said Capitol Police Officer <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, an organizer, said bail was set at $ 25, and a $ 500 bail fund had been established to benefit any homeless people who were arrested. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valkenburg </PERSON>, 51, has lived on the streets for 10 years. He's survived 35-below zero nights on <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION>, even after suffering three heart attacks and a stroke The event was held in memory of <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, 32, a friend of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valkenburg </PERSON>'s who died last winter. Organizers of the event said the state provided $ 2.2 million to make sure the homeless were sheltered last winter. But because of the state's worsening fiscal status, only $ 1.5 million is available this year. `` If the state ca n't provide for rescue, than we'll have to take the space and make it available,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, an activist from <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Landolfi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the office of <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said that regardless of the budget crunch, `` nobody's going to be out on the streets due to a lack of beds.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valkenburg </PERSON> said he worked as a cook at two hotels for 20 years until 10 years ago when he was disabled. In addition to two heart attacks, he suffered a stroke that left him partially disabled and he relies on a brace to walk. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Valkenburg </PERSON> receives about $ 100 a week in disability payments from the state, but he ca n't accumulate enough to pay advance rent and security for a room and still buy food. He relies on shelters in the cold months.

 The White House said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regards captialism as the best formula for curing the economic problems of Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but said `` we have not tried to dictate it for any of these countries.'' The statement came after Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> do not spell the demise of socialism and denounced calls for `` exporting capitalism'' to the Soviet bloc. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has joined other Western countries in providing aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as they try to reform their economies into a free-market system. `` But we do n't think that's a conflict with the concerns raised by President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> views the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' free-market system `` as the pride of the world and as a good way to reform the economic problems that they are facing We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the rewards that it has offered. `` We hold it up as an example to all, but we have not tried to dictate it for any of these countries,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He added, `` We have no apologies or concern with anything that we've done at this point.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet for a summit Dec. 2-3 on ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considering a stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, on the way home to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on the talks. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make a commitment to progress on reducing strategic nuclear stockpiles and conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He stressed, however, that there would be no major agreements, saying, `` We will not be counting throw weights.''

 An East German political group said Wednesday it would make the first direct challenge to Communist rule by asking Parliament this week to end the party's 40-year-old monopoly on power, and predicted an easy victory. Communist officials spurned <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s offer of an economic bailout. They said they prefer their own course to recovery and hinted at reforms to encourage free-enterprise investment. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, a mass-circulation West German newspaper, reported Wednesday that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would meet with party chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> after a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress Dec. 15-17 that is expected to make major changes in the East German leadership. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, hundreds gathered at the enormous <ORGANIZATION> Brandenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION>, hoping the East Germans would break through the Berlin Wall in front of the 200-year-old `` symbol of unity.'' A West German television network said up to 7,000 East German refugees were expected to return to their homeland. The East German constitution's guarantee of a `` leading role'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will be challenged at Friday's sitting of the increasingly independent-minded <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It was unclear whether a vote on the constitutional change would come the same day. `` I figure it will pass with a large majority,'' <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> radio network. His party, once closely allied with the Communists, has been at the forefront of calls for change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The new speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, non-Communist <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON>, on Tuesday urged a constitutional change to allow a true multiparty government. The East German constitution specifies that constitutional changes must be approved a majority of the lawmakers in the 500-member Parliament, or People's Chamber. Despite <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>'s prediction, a majority of the chamber is still believed to be made up of orthodox members likely to reject the measure. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, however, has shown increasing signs of independence, engaging in once-unthinkable debates and casting 26 votes Oct. 24 against naming <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as president Oct. 24. For weeks, <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> has urged the Communists to abandon their `` leading role,'' but Friday's motion will be the first direct challenge. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> also predicted free elections as early as next year, and said the Communists would fail to win a majority. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has promised free elections, but has not set a date. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership on Wednesday weighed the latest pledge of economic aid from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, offered in exchange for sweeping political and economic reforms. West German Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> on Tuesday announced the offer of massive economic aid, which he likened to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan that helped rebuild <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the Nazi defeat in World War II. There was no formal government response from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>'s offer, but officials have made clear they do not favor a full free-market system. The Communist-aligned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> outlined measures to attract private investment. Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maassen </PERSON> called for tax breaks for East Germans who want to privately produce goods and services to fill the nation's vast consumer void. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run newspapers printed doubtful comments on the prospects for accepting handouts, declaring no interest in a `` sellout'' of their socialist state. Economist <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can manage its own recovery, an indication that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s offer may be rejected. The government-run Bauern-Echo newspaper, aimed at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s farmers, warned against too much influence from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout,'' the newspaper said. It deemed the two German states `` politically and economically too diverse.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> cautioned against excessive West German involvement in East German affairs. `` East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> needs no patronage,'' <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` no apologies'' for extolling capitalism as a remedy for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s economic woes. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had warned the West against gloating about the demise of socialism or attempting to `` export capitalism.'' `` We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the rewards that it has offered,'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We hold it up as an example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these countries.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said he was surprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet policy. `` This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' said <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a Politburo member. `` We would like to have a common European house based on freedom. If someone interferes in that process, we might go back to the time of the Cold War. We are standing at such a juncture.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network said Wednesday as many as 7,000 East Germans were expected to return home because they had become disenchanted with life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The East German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has predicted 10,000 could return. Nearly 300,000 East Germans arrived for visits in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the past 24 hours, West German border police said Wednesday. East German authorities have issued 7.8 million visas in five days, or nearly half of the 16.5 million population, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported.

 <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it has filed petitions with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to allow alternative telecommunications carriers to compete for local telephone access services. `` This action is a logical extension of historical regulatory policy designed to generate competition in the telecommunications industry,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompliano </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Oakbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION>, Ill. Currently the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and other operating companies provide local phone access for all long-distance carriers. Nearly 50 cents of every dollar spent on long-distance services goes to the Bell companies for access fees, totaling about $ 20 billion a year. <PERSON> Pompliano </PERSON> said his company was asking the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` to enforce the Modified Final Judgment to require that local access ... be ` unbundled' to the fullest extent possible to permit fair and equitable competition.'' Also, he said, `` we are asking the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to mandate that alternative local telecommunications carriers can cost-effectively interconnect'' and locate equipment at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> facilities. `` That means <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> and similar alternative carriers can install their equipment in Bell-owned switch sites and hook up to the user community via the Bell network,'' <PERSON> Pompliano </PERSON> said. Commenting on the announcement, A. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for external affairs, said: `` Metropolitan Fiber is free to use <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>'s services any way it wants, and it is free to connect its own network with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>'s.'' `` Metropolitan Fiber, however, is demanding more than this. It is demanding collocation, which is, in effect, the ability to set up their shop in our store. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> has no legal obligation to do this, but it has agreed to meet a number of Metropolitan's requests,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, said about the <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> action: `` These petitions appear to propose more confusion in the telephone industry. They do not appear to offer any new services that residential customers might use'' but instead appear `` designed to benefit only high-volume users of specialized business services.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, public relations manager for <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, commented: `` The announcement by Metropolitan Fiber Systems simply confirms the fact that there's growing competition in the telecommunications markets served by the regional holding companies.'' He added that `` <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> stands ready to consider any reasonable requests for interconnection that will help ensure customer demands are met.'' <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> currently operates fiber optic communication networks in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, with networks in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to be completed by the end of this year. The company also is planning to construct networks in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pompliano </PERSON> said `` the problem with having a single supplier exclusively control the local access business is that the lack of competition provides no incentive to be responsive to customer needs, offer new services, or lower rates.'' `` If alternative local telecommunications carriers like <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> are allowed to offer access services, technology will improve ahead of current projections and the rates for local access will drop,'' the <ORGANIZATION> MFS </ORGANIZATION> chief said.

<HEAD>Bill Would Force States To Suspend Driver's Licenses Of Drug Abusers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The top federal highway official asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday not to pass a bill that would compel states to suspend driver's licenses of convicted drug abusers. Federal Highway Administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> asked a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee to defer action on the proposal until more is known about its legal implications. The bill would withhold a portion of federal highway funds from states that do not pass such laws. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, called the measure `` legalized blackmail'' and said it would unduly extend the reach of the federal government. But <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> later said he was keeping an open mind because of his support for the goals of the bill. Its chief sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the measure would discourage drug use, particularly among young people, and make highways safer. `` Driving is a privilege, not a right,'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said. `` And if a citizen chooses to engage in illegal drug behavior, he or she should lose that privilege.'' <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said about half the states already have laws that allow suspension or revokation of driving privileges upon conviction for a drug offense, although most do not make such action mandatory. He said a law that suspends a driver's license for sex offenses was thrown out by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Some states have had difficulty tracking down drivers to obtain their suspended licenses, particularly in large urban areas, <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. `` While we support the goals of the program,'' <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said, `` we believe that more time may be helpful to consider the many complex issues involved.'' Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> police officer speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said the group supports the bill but has reservations about its possible impact in states where the loss of federal funds might affect money going to police departments. He said rules are needed to prevent this. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perretti </PERSON> said state officials believe their law that suspends driver's licenses has discouraged drug use among youths and middle-class offenders. `` Suspension of a driver's license is the most effective deterent next to jail,'' <PERSON> Perretti </PERSON> told the subcommittee.

 A bomb ripped through a car traveling on a rural highway in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION> Wednesday, killing the driver, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility in a statement issued to local media and alleged that the victim, a businessman, worked for the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province's security forces. Police denied he had any connection with the security forces. The man, whose name was not released, was driving on the highway between <LOCATION> Dungannon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ballygawley </LOCATION>, about 8 miles from the province's border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, when a 2-pound bomb hidden under the car detonated, a police spokesman said. The explosion blew the roof off the car, which burst into flames, the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Earlier, several hundred <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> demonstrators marked the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement by linking hands along main roads in different parts of the province. Organizers had predicted a turnout of 300,000 people. `` I recognize that the imaginative scheme did not capture the imagination of the Ulster people,'' said an organizer, the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, a legislator in the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Organizers blamed the low turnout partly on the absence of two <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leaders, the Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> who is visiting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> who was lobbying fellow British legislators in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The 1985 agreement between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> gave the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government a consultative role in the affairs of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for the first time. It set up a permanent secretariat of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> civil servants in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to deal with the grievances the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority claim they suffer under the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority. The agreement also pledged cooperation between the two countries on security measures along their common border.

 <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> hospitals, facing the strictest anti-smoking law in the nation, are ready to hand out carrot sticks, popcorn and advice on going cold <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> as they comply with the new law Thursday. Some hospitals have imposed smoking bans already, and others, including the state's largest, are adopting policies stricter than the new state law, which takes effect on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s Great American Smokeout. As they kick smokers outside, many of the hospitals are offering programs to employees who are inspired to quit. At the <LOCATION> Osteopathic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, the staff plans to hand out carrot sticks, popcorn and crossword puzzles to help patients get through the day without their smokes, said spokeswoan <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Frechette </PERSON>. The hospital will also operate a telephone help line for staff and patients, <PERSON> Frechette </PERSON> said. Respiratory therapists will visit patients and give advice on how to break the habit. The law, supported by a coalition of health groups and the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, bars smoking by patients, staff and visitors in all hospitals, including the state's two psychiatric facilities. Exceptions are allowed only when a patient receives written permission from a doctor, and in such cases the smoking must be done in a designated area away from other patients. Laws with exceptions similar to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s will take effect in January in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A less restrictive law allowing smoking in some ventilated areas is in effect in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. As many as half of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s 43 hospitals had no-smoking policies prior to the new law, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Down <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Machias </LOCATION>, which imposed its policy at midnight Sunday, is banning smoking even with doctors' permission, said chief executive officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> So far, the ban appears to have been `` relatively calmly accepted,'' said <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, who has also noticed that the rule has induced some staff members to kick the habit. `` You almost sense this gratitude thing'' among those employees, said <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>. At <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s psychiatric unit, an exception for all patients is being issued, said <PERSON> Jeffre </PERSON> <PERSON> Witherly </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> hospital. He explained that the doctor in charge of the unit believes smoking may be `` vital to each patient's care.'' Smoking in the rest of the hospital is banned, except in cases where `` compassionate use'' is allowed by a doctor. <PERSON> Witherly </PERSON> said patients receiving exceptions might include those with terminal illnesses. The <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has been gradually reducing smoking hours for three months and will be virtually smoke-free Thursday, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, superindendent of the state-run psychiatric hospital. Fruit and juices that can be alternatives for smoking will be offered, along with group talks and support for those quitting, said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. He expects a few exceptions to be permitted, and only in the admissions unit. `` It's not going down well with everybody,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, adding that patients who continue to smoke will have to go outside. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreher </PERSON>, medical director of chemical dependency rehabilitation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, said he believes most doctors will only be persuaded to grant exceptions under the most compelling circumstances. He predicted that `` over time the number of exceptions is going to decline.''

<TEXT>
 Cabinet ministers made plans Wednesday for bringing order to the return of about 3,000 Egyptian workers a day from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and an official said they leaving for economic reasons, not because of maltreatment. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> called a meeting of Egyptian residents and complained about <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspaper reports that the workers were being mistreated. He promised to investigate any complaints, but discounted claims that many Egyptians have been killed maliciously in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He said they died naturally or from violence in numbers understandable in a group of about 2 million people. Rumors circulated Wednesday among diplomats in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Najm </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador, had received a death threat. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Farhan </PERSON> denied the reports and said the ambassador was not in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON>, secretary-general of President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s cabinet, said the ministers were told the main reason Egyptians were returning was that new fiscal rules in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reduced the amount of money alien workers could send home He said <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouf </PERSON>, Egyptian ambassador in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, told the ministers a manpower surplus had resulted from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demobilization after the truce agreement of August 1988 in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ouf said Iraqi employers were dismissing Egyptians and giving their jobs to former <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers, according to <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON>. The Cabinet official did not address reports by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> that more than 100 Egyptian corpses were returned from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in October, compared to an average of two or three in other months. He did say, however, that Ouf told the ministers Iraqi authorities were prepared to present complete files on Egyptians who die in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> has reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> death certificates attributed most of the Egyptian deaths to violent causes. On Wednesday, it said five bodies of Egyptian men aged 23-40 arrived at the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> airport the day before with documents indicating two died of skull fractures, one of burns and one of heart failure. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> said the cause of the fifth death was not determined. <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON>'s comments were distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He said the ministerial group was headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> and including the foreign, finance, labor, immigration, supplies and administrative affairs ministers, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and Ambassador Ouf. Tens of thousands of Egyptians are said to be awaiting transportation from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The departures began soon after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> issued new regulations Oct. 1 on sending money home. <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, deputy prime minister, are to discuss the situation Saturday in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is making `` a great leap backward'' and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should withold full cooperation until a new, more democratic regime is in place in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Lord told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that it likely will take several years before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reverses the course it embarked upon when it brutally cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tianamen Square. Until such a reversal, he said, `` we must both sustain our condemnation of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s actions and preserve the framework for future cooperation when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s big chill is lifted. `` For us to resume full cooperation will require a new regime in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' he said. Lord, who was ambassaddor in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> from November 1985 to last April, said he had been reluctant to comment on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s problems until the crackdown in June. `` Such inhibitions have been swept away as <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s leaders proceded from intransigence to massacre to executions to repression, roundups, purges, disappearances, harassment, surveilance, Orwellian groupthink, rollback of reforms and extreme xenophobia _ all cloaked in a particularly brazen display of the Big Lie,'' he said. `` Since June the trends have been bleak indeed as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> seems to be making a great leap backward to the 1950's and 1960's,'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. In this period, he said, the loyalty of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` should be to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials _ some deposed, many still in office _ who deplore such policies and not to the handful responsible for crushing Chinese spirits.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should do nothing, he said, to break the web of relationships that have been built since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> normalized relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We can not rip out all of these roots that we have so carefully nutured,'' he said. `` We must preserve the foundations for the time when a more cooperative relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is once again possible.'' Above all, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must realize that `` the Chinese are responsible for the current impasse and it is up to them to break it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> researchers said Wednesday they have found that implanting genetically altered skin cells in the brains of rats can reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease The study was the first to report behavioral effects from genetically modified cells grafted onto the brain, the scientists said. The research does not portend a cure for Parkinson's and is not ready for human testing, but it may offer a possible alternative to fetal cell implants, which have proved effective against the disease but which have become mired in political and ethical controversy, they said. `` We have to see if we can increase the effects we've seen,'' which are not as significant as the effects observed when fetal cells are transplanted, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>, a neuroscientist at the university in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. In their study, the scientists genetically altered skin cells of the rats to make them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients. When these cells were transplanted into the rats' brains, where lesions had been induced to cause neurological abonormalities mimicing Parkinson's disease, an average 40 percent reduction in abnormal behavior was seen, <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The results of the study, conducted by <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, including Dr. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedmann </PERSON>, a pioneer in the development of genetically modified cells, were to be published in the latest issue of Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 400,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suffer from Parkinson's disease, a nerve disorder characterized by trembling, muscle rigidity and difficulty walking and balancing. In the study, the scientists monitored general motor impairment in the rats and specifically rotational behavior in which the rats walk in circles as a result of their neurological damage. <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said that fetal cell implants can reverse this disability 100 percent, while the genetically altered skin cells were only partially successful. `` As it stands right now, it's nowhere near as effective as fetal tissue,'' <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said. However, `` this new approach offers a possible alternative,'' considering the current limitations on fetal tissue research, he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration earlier this month extended indefinitely a ban on federal financing of research in which human fetal tissue from induced abortions is transplanted into human patients. <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said the technique studied represents a merging of two technologies, transplantation and gene transfer, to create genetically modified cells that produce chemicals secreted in the brain to restore behavioral function. The researchers took skin cells from rats and inserted genes to produce an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase, which serves as a catalyst to make the cell produce L-dopa. These L-dopa-producing cells were then grafted into the brains of rats. <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said that because the skin cells can be taken from the same rat into which the modified cells are implanted, the chances of immunological rejection can be decreased. Also, `` by it's very nature, this sidesteps the fetal tissue issue,'' he said.

 Two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday called for investigation of an agreement between a cigarette manufacturer and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> to sponsor a campaign commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. `` <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has bought the exclusive rights to the Constitution which we entrusted to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, for the modern equivalent of 30 pieces of silver or $ 600,000,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, in a statement announcing a congressional hearing on Thursday. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Democrat heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials, which has jurisdictin over advertising and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to look into the matter The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer organization, wrote Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, last week asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revoke the agreement. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> has written <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the archivist of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, questioning how and why the agreement was made. The two-year agreement, signed in August, makes <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cigarette maker, a part of the official <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> bicentennial celebration of the Bill of Rights. In a `` memorandum of understanding'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> agreed to donate $ 600,000 to the Archives trust fund in exchange for being allowed to publish or broadcast announcements and promotional materials commemorating the bicentennial and referring to the Archives. Critics have questioned whether the broadcast announcements constitute cigarette advertisements on radio and television, which was banned by the federal government in 1971. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> ads are running on television and do not contain any health warning and apparently are a fragrant violation of the law prohibiting such video commercials,'' said <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' vice president of corporate affairs, said he did n't believe the company's announcements violated the advertising ban since `` there is no cigarette called <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>.'' `` In the same week that the Berlin Wall is being torn down that people in this country are being criticized for celebrating the Bill of Rights is very strange,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added in a reference to recent events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The company plans to continue the campaign and send a representative to testify at Thursday's hearing, he said. Critics also have questioned corporate sponsorship of Archives programs. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the `` commercialization of space in the building which houses the symbols of our nation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not only permitted the agency to accept tax-exempt donations to its trust fund but also specifically `` encouraged it to do so in order to enhance it's archival and outreach activities,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Archives. While this the first large corporate donation to the Archives trust fund, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, it is not the first cooperative effort with private industry. In addition, she said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' sponsorship of an exhibit in the Archives building is no different than when other companies underwrote receptions to celebrate the bicentenial of the Constitution or when <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> itself sponsored exhibits at the National Art Gallery.

 Palestinians set off fireworks, danced, flew outlawed flags and launched balloons Wednesday, the first anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration of their independence. Many celebrations in the occupied lands were peaceful, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said at least 19 Palestinians were wounded or beaten by soldiers reacting to stone-throwing attacks.

Young Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> gave up stone-throwing for the day and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers also used restraint, keeping away from dozens of marches and rallies like those held in this hilltop town of 3,500 people 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Several Israeli newspapers said Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a closed parliament committee session he had information that leaders of the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising had ordered increased use of firearms to attack soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has directed that firearms not be used. The most common weapons are stones and firebombs. Whatever the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders, there was a call to arms during a rally in Mazraa Asharkiya. `` We congratulate our people today and we promise you to continue our struggle! With the gun we will achieve our independence; only with the gun!'' a young man in a `` popular army'' khaki uniform, masked with an Arab head scarf, shouted through a megaphone. He was applauded by about 1,000 men and women in the main square and on rooftops holding balloons and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has outlawed. Many adults clapped rhythmically and children sang the Palestinian anthem `` Biladi, Biladi,'' Arabic for `` My Country, My Country.'' From the crowd came chants of `` Do n't be afraid, do n't be afraid, the stone will become a Kalashnikov,'' a Soviet-designed automatic rifle. About 150 uniformed youths later marched streets of the village, past houses adorned with photographs of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla leaders <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. Young men daubed `` Let's burn the land under the feet of occupation'' on walls. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers manned a checkpoint outside <PERSON> Mazraa </PERSON> <PERSON> Asharkiya </PERSON> but did not intervene. An army helicopter clattered overhead. Observances were held in other towns, including <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Dozens of masked youths defied an army curfew in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> by lighting torches and shouting: `` With blood and soul, we will redeem Palestine!'' Balloons in the red, green, white and black of the Palestinian flag hovered over rooftops. A huge red balloon attached to a flag was emblazoned with: `` The independent Palestinian state lives on.'' At Jebel Mukhaber village in the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> district, children holding balloons marched to a drum beat until riot police dispersed them. Youths in <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, danced the Arabic `` debka,'' beat drums and waved <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police fired tear gas to disperse Palestinians who hurled stones during a march by 200 doctors, nurses and patients outside a hospital on the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olives </LOCATION>. The Palestinian casualties were reported in several <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhoods and refugee camps. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said three were injured by rubber bullets or beatings and the others were shot.

 Two farms near <LOCATION> Boone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, are in friendly competition to test the merits of low-input methods against more traditional ways of producing crops, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Information will be gathered by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists over a number of years to help determine which kind of farming is superior, said the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The study began last spring, and results of the 1989 harvest are being analyzed now. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency said the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> project is `` one of the first studies to combine basic scientific studies with an economic analysis.'' Two adjacent 40-acre fields are being used, he said. One is part of a 300-acre private research farm that belongs to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, longtime advocates of low-input, sustainable agriculture designed to maintain the environment as well as the farm. Except for a few experimental plots, the Thompsons have used no pesticides or commercial nitrogen fertilizer on the land since 1967. Crop rotations are used, including corn, soybeans, oats and hay. The adjacent field is part of 1,400 acres of corn and soybeans farmed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> with minimum fall tillage. He has rotated corn and soybean crops on his land for at least 15 years. <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> uses pesticides and commercial fertilizers `` judiciously,'' the report said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top safety officer on Wednesday compared a two-day safety stand-down to a timeout in an athletic contest called to `` review the game plan and get back to the basics.'' The exercise is a useful tool, said Capt. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The stand-down ordered Tuesday is the most widespread in memory, he said. It was ordered after a rash of 10 accidents in the last three weeks killed 10 people and injured 71. All <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> units will spend 48 of 72 hours this week reviewing procedures and training, looking at the work environment, and reminding all hands of safety measures, according to the stand-down ordered by Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, chief of naval operations. `` A timeout also can be called to halt the momentum of the opponent, ... in this case, the string of mishaps,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said at a news conference. The safety center analyzes all <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> accidents worldwide in an attempt to prevent further problems. `` Safety is the product of sound operating procedures and good training,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. `` We want to leave no stone unturned to ensure that safety is uppermost in the minds of all hands, at all times,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s record of safety has been steadily improving over recent years. There were 118 major problems during operations in 1984. That figure has dropped to 69 so far this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> figures. However, the number of fatalities for 1984 was 64; 102 sailors have been killed so far this year, including 47 in the April 19th gun turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said the center's analysis found no clear links between accidents of the last three weeks. He also said there was no indication that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts had any effect on accidents. `` We're got a tough business. ... We're expected to be able to go tomorrow anywhere in the world and be an instrument of national policy. That's what the government expects and that's what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people expect,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, personnel at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> spent the day preparing for the stand-down. `` Most of the units did not find out about the stand-down until late yesterday. The 72-hour window gives them time to plan the rotations and wind down any missions they are on,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> ships at sea will not be called home for the safety drill. `` Ships at sea will stand-down at sea. Those on shore will do their stand-down there.'' The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. he pilot and four others were killed. On Monday, the destroyer USS Kinkaid and a freighter collided in the <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> killing one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> crewman, injuring five, and starting fires on both vessels. Last Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed into an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, killing two civilians and injuring two others, including himself.

<HEAD>1000s of Colombian Judges, Court Workers Return to Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Colombian judges and court workers ended a two-week strike Wednesday after the government promised to increase security for judges threatened by drug traffickers. Justice Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said in a meeting with union representatives that beginning next week, the government would start providing the judges with bulletproof vests, armored cars and bodyguards, a union representative said. The strike by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> involved about 5,000 judges and 12,000 court workers. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> also pledged that the offices of certain judges would be moved to government buildings offering more security, said <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a union board member. `` Some judges' offices are located in extremely dangerous neighborhoods,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. `` These are the ones that will be moved.'' She said the union was satisfied with the government's promises but that their quick implementation was vital to keeping the courts open. `` If the government does not act quickly to put the measures in place, the union will call another strike,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The judges say the measures are necessary to prevent the decimation of their ranks by drug traffickers retaliating for a government crackdown on the country's cocaine cartels. The latest strike began Nov. 2, one day after a federal judge was shot and killed in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the hub of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine trade. No one claimed responsibility for the killing, but authorities have blamed traffickers. Three judges have been killed in the last three months, all presumably by drug traffickers. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> declared war on traffickers after they assassinated a leading presidential candidate on Aug. 18. Six Colombian drug suspects have been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of the campaign. A terrorist group linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel has promised to kill 10 judges for every trafficker extradited. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Wednesday announced it had provided additional aid for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judges. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said in a communique that it had delivered to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government 300 bulletproof vests, 12 bullet-resistant cars, 12 metal detectors and $ 500,000 for the purchase of other security equipment. Another load of weapons, munitions and security equipment for judges reportedly arrived in the capital aboard a Hercules cargo plane sent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castello </PERSON>, said the embassy could neither confirm nor deny a radio report of the donation. Judges returning to work must face a huge backlog of criminal cases made even bigger by the two-week strike. Before the strike ended, prison officials had begun to release some prisoners because they could no longer detain them without setting a trial date. The government has also promised to review possible salary increases for the judges, who currently make about $ 400 a month.

 A non-communist Cambodian rebel leader said Wednesday the men who led the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government more than a decade ago should accept exile in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to quiet fears that they will return to power. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, whose guerrillas are technically allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, addressed a news conference on the first day of the annual <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` I invite <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and all other <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders who committed great crimes to prepare for their future in a pagoda in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. He referred to reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, embarrassed by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s record, would offer him and his colleagues refuge, thus eliminating a major obstacle to a Cambodian settlement `` If you disarm and <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and all parties and let people vote, they are not going to vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told the reporters. <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government that took over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in April 1975 and killed or starved hundreds of thousands of Cambodians before it was ousted by the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> now is the strongest fighting force in the alliance of three guerrilla groups. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> ruler who leads the alliance, Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of trying to divert attention from what the rebels claim is its continued presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by focusing on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> threat. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says all its soldiers were withdrawn from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September, but the guerrilla alliance claims more than 1 million remain, disguised as Cambodian troops and settlers. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for rejecting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision and verification of the withdrawal. `` In order to divert the international community from the subterfuge of ` total withdrawal,' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> continues to brandish the threat of the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to power,'' he said. `` It keeps rejecting all effective and impartial measures to control its so-called total withdrawal and maintaining at all cost the regime it has installed in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>.'' He suggested a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for five to 10 years to help safeguard civil rights, verify disarmament of the fighting groups and make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> did not return to power. Vietnamese Ambassador <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said the two major issues in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> were Vietnamese withdrawal and keeping the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> out of power. All the Vietnamese were gone, he declared, and `` the remaining key issue is the need to prevent the <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> clique from waging civil war and re-establishing their genocidal regime in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' This is the 11th annual <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate since the Vietnamese invasion. Members are expected to give overwhelming approval to a resolution for a comprehensive political settlement and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> validation of the Vietnamese withdrawal. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> recognizes the resistance alliance as <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s legitimate government.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday passed an unprecedented joint U.S.-Soviet resolution urging nations to settle conflicts peacefully and respect human rights. Although the resolution passed unanimously, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> expressed unease over whether the superpowers might use their new spirit of cooperation to stifle debate on issues not high on their agenda. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Ambassador <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagami </PERSON> said: `` Any part of this resolution must not be interpreted to justify undue politicization of issues of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> under the name of peace and security.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Ambassador <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira-Batista </PERSON> pointed out that the resolution stressed the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, but failed to mention the Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which sets policy on social matters such as the environment, AIDS, and the anti-drug fight. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> both joined in the consensus on the resolution, however. The resolution urges all nations to obey the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter and use <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bodies to settle disputes, but offers no specific proposals to end conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> or elsewhere. It calls on all nations to `` respect the principles of sovereign equality, political independence and territorial integrity of states, and non-intervention in foreign affairs.'' It also calls on nations to `` refrain from the threat or use of force inconsistent with the charter,'' which permits only self-defense, and to `` peacefully settle disputes.'' Nations should `` adhere to the principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, cooperation among states.'' General Assembly resolutions have no binding effect on nations, but the superpowers have the ability to persuade their allies to resolve disputes peacefully when they wish. Earlier this month, at a joint U.S.-Soviet news conference, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> stressed that the resolution puts an end to the superpower rivalry that prevailed during the Cold War years. `` Today, it is an end to confrontation,'' said his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared on Wednesday that his summit with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will not be a meeting `` to negotiate the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` Only free and unfettered elections can satisfy the yearnings of free people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. He praised the labor movement for being the spark that ignited the fires of freedom in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` At <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, I will work to advance -LRB- the -RRB- progress of reform and democracy,'' he said. `` Everywhere you look in the world, members of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> are fighting to keep the door to freedom open for all.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying `` let us join hands,'' also used the occasion of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s triumphant visit on Wednesday to propose to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> a `` parternship for progress'' to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> restructure its economy. Steering clear of issues that have divided his administration and organized labor, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asserted that doors that the labor union helped to unlock throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` can not be locked again.'' He also told the 14.1 million-member federation's biennial convention that he would discuss the importance of trade unions in `` building a free country'' in his Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asserted that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` are not meeting to negotiate the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The peoples of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are speaking their own minds about that future. They are calling for democracy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reaffirmed his opposition to German reunification and criticized westerners who suggested socialism had failed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lavished warm praise on <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> _ who was present as the president spoke and who received enthusiastic applause when his presence was noted _ as `` labor's son and democracy's advocate.'' The president told his audience: `` you and I may have differences.'' But, he said, `` there are times when the need for progress demands that we put differences aside. Where <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is concerend, now is such a time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has been critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies and those of his predecessor. In fact, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not address the labor federation in his eight years in office.' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was applauded during his speech, but afterward chants of `` sign the bill, sign the bill'' rang out throughout the standing audience. Labor is awaiting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision on a bill to authorize a congressional investigation of the eight-month <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, and a large banner urging him to `` sign the Eastern bill'' was displayed in the hall. Another bill _ one raising the minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 _ is also awaiting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signture. However, the fate o that legislation is not in doubt, since the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> helped negotiate the final version with labor and congressional leaders. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said earlier in the day that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the minimum wage bill, but that a time for the signing had not yet been decided. Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took his term at the podium, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, called the president's outspoken support of Solidarity hypocritical, claiming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had worked to undermine the powers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unions. `` It's ironic that so many who are willing to honor the Solidarity union of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are so hostile to the unions of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told 800 delegates and another several hundred guests at the convention. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s praise of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who addressed the group the day before, was enthusiastically received. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was calling on the labor movement, the business community and government `` to look for ways to support a partnership for progress in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ... Labor, business and government can and should be partners and activisits for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not spell out any specifics. However, he noted that he and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had discussed the importance of increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that, while he was pleased with Tuesday's announcement of freedom of travel in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, `` in that country, where the tradition of democracy runs deep _ and in others, freedom of travel is not enough. `` Change has a way of sweeping through like a fast-moving train. No one _ and no government _ should stand in the way.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he had asked <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who recently referred to the president as `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON>,'' to be part of a delegation that will go to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Nov. 28 - Dec. 2 to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> restructure its economy <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is nearing final approval of a package of about $ 800 million in economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, steps that have the backing of the administration. In accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of trying to weaken <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unions, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> in particular cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to intervene and block the 8-months-old <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to use his power to name an emergency mediation board. `` They're all for labor unions as long as they are in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or some other country, anywhere but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Labor is awaiting word on whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sign a measure calling for a congressional study of the Eastern strike designed to produce recommendations for a settlement. `` If he ca n't do that -LRB- sign the bill -RRB- I do n't think labor can expect too much from him,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> and newly elected member of the federation's governing Executive Council. `` I do n't hold out hope that will sign it.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, meanwhile, was unanimously re-elected to a sixth-two year term. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> was the unanimous choice to continue as the federation's secretary

 Here is a summary of major provisions in the pay raise and ethics reform package announced by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Wednesday.

 The plan envisions top government pay scales increasing at least 35 percent in the next 13 -LCB- months. House members, federal judges and top executive branch officials would receive an initial 7.9 percent pay raise by Jan. 1, a `` catch up'' for two years without a cost-of-living adjustment or COLA. On Jan. 1, 1991, the same officials would receive a 25 percent increase in pay, on top of whatever government-wide COLA takes effect at that time. At a minimum, assuming no COLA in 1991, the salary of rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would go to $ 120,700. Assuming a COLA of about 3 percent, salaries would be about $ 124,400 _ 39 percent above current levels. After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be made automatically based on the government's index of private-sector wages and salaries. The package would abolish the current federal pay commission which recommends top government salaries and replace it with a new 11-member <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

For <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, current rules limit such fees to 30 percent of salary; for 1990, total permissible outside income for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would be frozen at the 1989 level. Once the ban takes effect, payments for speeches which may be given to charity would have to be made directly to the charity and could not exceed $ 2,000, and could not go to any charity from which the official or a relative receives a financial benefit. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would not make public the name of the charity, as it does now; only the name of the donor. Income earned outside the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by members and top staff would be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991. Officials could not receive directors fees, legal fees or other income for professional services. Book royalties would be exempt from the limits, but only if they are from established publishers and are `` usual and customary.'' Both the limit on outside income and the honoraria ban would be lifted if the pay raise is repealed.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his support Wednesday for a plan to raise salaries for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and other top governmental officials by 35 percent or more while tightening ethics rules. With the president's endorsement, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders formally unveiled their plan and said they expect it will pass easily in a vote Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote on pay before Thanksgiving, maybe with a different level for itself. The House package would, depending on inflation, raise its salaries by at least 35 percent and more likely 39 percent, from $ 89,500 to an estimated $ 124,400, in just over 13 months. It could be more. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a letter to the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, said: `` Issues such as the ban on congressional honoraria, limits on gifts and travel, increased financial disclosure, restrictions on outside income, conflict of interest rules and many other important reforms have been addressed. `` In my view, the bill would effect a tremendous change in the landscape of government ethics standards.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan, raises would be given to top officials government-wide, except for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which was considering a separate ethics and pay package for itself. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> package implements the pay raise in two stages. On Jan. 1, members and the very highest paid officials, such as federal judges and top Executive Branch officials, would get a 7.9 percent increase as a `` cost-of-living'' adjustment to make up for the two years in which they did not receive raises. In 1991, another cost-of-living raise would take effect for members, and the top-most officials. Under that adjustment, which would be based on changes in the government's consumer price calculations, members and high officials would get the same adjustment normally passed on to all federal workers. The $ 124,400 ultimate pay figure is based on an adjustment of about 3 percent. Also on Jan. 1, 1991, an additional 25 percent raise would be put in place to accompany implementation of the heart of the ethics package _ a ban on lawmakers padding their income with speech honoraria and stricter limits on other outside income. The inclusion of a cost-of-living increase in 1991 in addition to the 25 percent raise was disclosed by lawmakers for the first time on Wednesday. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are allowed to keep honoraria up to 30 percent of their income, senators up to 40 percent. The new rules would ban <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from accepting honoraria and limit other outside earned income to 15 percent of salary. A House member would still be able to give a speech and have the host donate the money that would be paid to the member to a legitimate charity. The destination of the payment would be kept secret by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later votes to kill the 25 percent pay raise, the ethics rules changes on outside income would automatically be rescinded. Cost-of-living raises would continue automatically after 1991, but based on a government index of salary raises in the private sector. Other ethics changes in the bill include: _ Ending in 1993 the rule whereby <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members elected before 1980 can pocket their campaign treasuries when they retire from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Some members currently have more than $ 1 million stashed away. _ Increased detail of disclosure of personal wealth Currently, the top category is `` $ 250,000 and above.'' The new forms would have categories for `` $ 250,000 to $ 500,000'' and `` greater than $ 1 million.'' Members who have blind trusts for their assets would have to report the size of the trust, in addition to the current requirement of reporting the income. _ Revised procedures for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including expanding the panel so that some members could investigate and others judge the results Currently, the whole panel does both. The committee would also set up a separate office to educate and advise lawmakers on ethics rules. _ Tighten rules for accepting free travel and gifts from people other than immediate family Several of the ethics changes were in response to the case of former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned last June rather than face charges that he accepted improper gifts and evaded limits on honoraria. A 51 percent congressional pay raise, with no attached ethics package, was rejected earlier this year when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was still speaker. White House endorsement of the ethics package was delayed this week because <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the president's counsel, was not satisfied with conflict-of-interest rules as they applied to congressional staff. The differences were resolved early Wednesday in a meeting between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has said he envisions a more modest pay package for senators, perhaps providing only the cost-of-living adjustments and a more gradual elimination of speech honoraria. On Wednesday, Sens. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, introduced a bill based on the work of their ethics task force that includes restrictions not found in the House package The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would tighten `` revolving door'' rules so that, for the first time, former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top staffers would be not be able to return to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to lobby for one year. Similar restrictions already exist for the executive branch. Like the House package, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules for accepting travel and gifts would be tightened, and personal financial disclosure would be increased.

<HEAD>Ten-Fold Increase In Potential Losses To Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 10-fold expansion of federal loan programs over the past 13 years now means the government has lent, guaranteed or insured $ 5 trillion _ $ 20,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, congressional auditors said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said ultimate losses to the government would not reach that level. `` While the government will undoubtedly not be required to provide financial assistance for its total exposure associated with these programs, its continuing and growing exposure to losses can not be ignored,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. While huge losses already have manifested themselves in the farm credit bailout in 1987 and the savings and loan rescue this year, the government is experiencing billions of dollars in losses from other credit and insurance programs as well, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. Altogether, the wide variety of loan guarantee programs has increased by 51 percent over the past five years to $ 550 billion. But annual defaults on those guarantees have jumped 138 percent, from $ 4.7 billion in 1983 to $ 11.2 billion last year, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The real situation could be worse, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> cautioned. For example, just two months ago <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> auditors found $ 4.2 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loan defaults in 1988 _ five times what the agency reported. `` The full magnitude of the government's losses under its credit assistance and insurance programs is not known,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Because of long-standing deficiencies in financial managements and inconsistencies in the application of accounting principles by federal agencies, losses are not always being recorded or reported when they occur.'' From 1985 to 1988 losses on direct loans written off by the government increased 1,700 percent _ from $ 1.2 billion to $ 21.2 billion _ and delinquent loans rose by 33 percent, from $ 14.6 billion to $ 19.5 billion last year. But the loan guarantees adopted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as part of an effort to reduce direct government lending and the federal deficit pose even greater risks, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Many newer guarantee programs such as those for education and energy conservation involve loans with little or no marketable property as security,'' the auditors said. Others, such as those for small businesses which can not obtain credit in the private market otherwise, can quickly turn sour upon industry downturns and other changes in the economy, the auditors said. As one example, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> cited the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s student loan guarantee program, which has grown in size from $ 26.5 billion in 1983 to $ 47.6 billion last year During that same time, reported defaults on student loans have almost tripled, From $ 486 million in 1983 to more than $ 1.4 billion in 1988. In addition to the outstanding $ 222 billion in direct federal loans and $ 550 billion in loan guarantees, the government also is liable for $ 3.6 trillion in insurance commitments, most of it covering deposits in banks, S & amp; Ls and credit unions. Outstanding loans by government-sponsored enterprises, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, total $ 656 billion, up from $ 15 billion in 1965. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who requested the study as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said it indicates that the government is `` guilty of the same shell game'' that critics of banks contend is being used to inflate beyond their true value their loans to Third World countries <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> did not question the value of the programs, saying many of served worthy purposes such as enabling people to attend college, buy homes and start businesses. `` What's at issue,'' he said, `` is the public's exposure in the event of losses or defaults.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The battle of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> tilted in the government's favor Wednesday as troops drove guerrillas from working-class neighborhoods in fierce combat while civilians fled or cowered in their homes. But the insurgents, in the fifth day of their most ambitious offensive in nearly nine years, demonstrated remarkable staying power in other neighborhoods, repelling repeated army assaults or regrouping after setbacks to strike again. Even so, the armed forces' air power and numerical superiority combined with a lack of insurrectional spirit in most working-class neighborhoods to stall the massive guerrilla push. `` What we have at the moment is complete control over the entire national territory, and the terrorist delinquents have failed in their adventure,'' said Vice President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>. His claim, made at a news conference, appeared somewhat exaggerated as the insurgents were thoroughly entrenched in several zones in and around the capital and in the countryside. Also Wednesday the government, which on Sunday decreed a state of siege suspending most constitutional guarantees, tightened limits on freedom of expression with a directive sent to all local media. The directive prohibits Salvadoran media from publishing any <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- communique or those of any group intending to disseminate <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> activities. It also prohibits `` publication of information from foreign agencies or countries that maintain a clear opposition to the Salvadoran government and people.'' The directive too obliges local editors `` to consult with the official source'' on any war-related news. Casualty figures from the fighting were inexact, but surveys of hospitals and a tally based on several sources indicated more than 500 people _ including civilians, guerrillas and soldiers _ have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded. Several hundred rebels, including two top commanders, were dug in at the northern capital district of <LOCATION> Mejicanos </LOCATION>. The scene in Mejicanos differed from that of <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION> _ other guerrilla strongholds in recent days _ in that most Mejicanos residents have stayed on in their homes, and many appear to be decidedly aligned with the rebels. Most of the civilians in <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Zacamil </PERSON> had fled the combat zones by Wednesday afternoon. `` Helping ` los muchachos' -LRB- the boys -RRB- makes us happy,'' said an elderly man outside the local clinic. `` It would be better to die struggling than let the SOB soldiers kill us with impunity.'' His words were punctuated by a U.S.-supplied C-47 warplane flying directly above and firing hollow-sounding bursts from its .50 - caliber machine guns at rebel The neighborhood's combative spirit was evident. Residents carried pots of soup from their homes to rebels seated on the clinic patio. Young men asked for and received instruction in the use of the rebels' assault rifles. Barricades blocked roads and tracks. <PERSON> Facundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardado </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> commander, said the offensive had one of two objectives: `` To oblige the government to negotiate seriously and responsibly,'' or, failing that, to topple the rightist administration of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> called on both sides to arrange a cease-fire for the urgent evacuation of wounded. Merino characterized the idea of a truce as impractical, and speculated that the rebels might take tactical advantage of such a measure. Residents of some of the working-class neighborhoods north and east of this capital where fighting has been the heaviest began burning partially decomposed bodies in the streets. Rebels opened a new front, in <LOCATION> Merliot </LOCATION> on the capital's western outskirts. They blocked the highway into the capital and established positions over several blocks. But government forces counterattacked strongly with rocket - and machine gun-equipped helicopters, heavy caliber strafing from C-47 warplanes and hundreds of troops The rebels were pushed out after two hours of combat. But they regrouped on the lower slopes of the looming <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano and shortly before dusk struck back at government positions in <LOCATION> Merliot </LOCATION>. Heavy fighting continued there at nightfall. Heavy combat also broke out shortly before dusk in <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION>, on the capital's northern outskirts. <PERSON> Comunidad </PERSON> <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON>, a small shantytown, was set ablaze and a pillar of smoke from it rose over the northern zone. Ten rebels, looking tired and anxious, were confined to a rear alley of the Conacaste section of <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>. Their commander, a tall lean man missing part of his left hand, said they had run out of food. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, a 30-year-old construction worker, said Wednesday he had been trying to reach Alley 4, where his family was holed up, for three days without success. Heavy fire from assault rifles, .30 - caliber machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades echoed deafeningly through the narrow alleys of one-floor cinderblock <PERSON> Gunsmoke </PERSON> was so thick it reduced visibility to 15 feet. Residents evacuated two wounded civilians _ one a middle-aged woman with her jaw blown off _ on improvised stretchers. In <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION>, only a few civilian familiesremained in the apartment blocks. <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> huddled in apartment 43 of Block 111A with her family and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zubarria </PERSON>, 45, who has cancer and is two days past due for her cobalt treatment. Mrs. <PERSON> Zubarria </PERSON>'s face, forearms and ankles were swollen because of the delay. `` Please help get us out!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> implored. She said she felt herself a virtual hostage of the guerrillas. `` We serve as their protection,'' she said, echoing the government's contention that the rebels were shielding themselves behind civilians. Rebel commander <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, speaking on the insurgents' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, said the guerrillas had declared more than a quarter of the Massachusetts-sized country `` liberated.'' She said local revolutionary committees had been set up in dozens of towns. In the provinces, conflicting claims by government and guerrillas were impossible to confirm, but radio correspondents _ prohibited from broadcasting news by the state of siege _ said fighting continued in and around the provincial capitals of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>. A 10-year-old civil war between the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and a succession of U.S.-backed governments has killed about 70,000 people, most of them civilians.

 <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said Wednesday that he supports pending new market regulation legislation even though it does n't ban program trading. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> told a group of reporters at <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters that the controversial, computer-driven trading strategy is only a symptom of bigger market problems. `` I think we need a close look at the whole issue of volatility and the factors that help produce it and the elements that may be at work. I'd like to make sure that before we treat only the symptom that we also are aware of what the disease is,'' he said. Critics of program trading, in which enormous blocks of stocks are bought or sold in a wink of an eye through computer-driven entry of buy and sell orders, say it can lead to excessive volatility _ sharp price rises and drops _ which in turn, scares small investors out of the market. And that, say the critics, makes it hard for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to sell securities and raise capital. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said he supported recently amended legislation pending before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that would allow the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to curtail trading practices found to be `` manipulative or abusive.'' `` I do n't think it gives us the authority to ban program trading per se,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said of the Securities Markets Stabilization Act of 1989. `` The thrust of this section is not to ban program trading as one practice in the marketplace. But what it does allow us to do is to specify specific harmful practices, including those associated with program trading.'' If the bill was passed, said <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> could then `` define rules that would bar specific practices that we deem to be harmful and contributing to excessive volatility and those practices could include program trading.'' Originally the bill would have allowed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to intervene when it considered trading practices to be `` disruptive,'' but members of the telecommunications and finance subcomitee argued that the word was too vague. In a letter to the subcommittee, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, an undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> argued the word `` is itself disruptive.'' <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> wrote that it could `` derail the chances for final passage of other important provisions included in this legislation.'' The bill must be passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before going to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Congressional leaders have said they want to adjourn for the holidays next week. A similar bill is slated to be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Seanate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Thursday.

Lawyers for the state said they will carry their fight to the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against the ruling that reversed convictions of former <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnerr </PERSON>, a millionaire and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> were convicted by a <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury on charges resulting from the Cincinnati-based thrift's collapse in March 1985 Both <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> have been free on bond while appealing their March 1987 convictions. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 70, had been sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON>, 58, was sentenced to six months. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday from his <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, horse farm that his reputation is still at stake. `` I feel sort of like <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> was found not guilty and he asked, ` Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?' That's about the situation I'm in,'' he said, referring to former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> secretary who was cleared by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jury in May 1987 of fraud and larceny charges. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said, `` I always knew I'd be vindicated.'' A three-judge panel of the 1st <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed the convictions on three securities counts charging the two men covered up Home State's precarious finances in circulars distributed to raise money for Home State in 1984. That portion of the case was sent back to the lower court for a possible new trial. Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately insured <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> savings and loans institutions whose deposits were insured by the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Deposit Guarantee Fund. The appeals court upheld defense arguments challenging the seating of trial juror <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Statt </PERSON>, who had an account at another bank insured by the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Deposit Guarantee Fund. The appeals court also dimissed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s conviction on six counts that he oversaw unauthorized transfers of Home State money to a trading partner, <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The court said the state did not present sufficient evidence. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortenson </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> can not be retried on those counts. Home State collapsed four days after <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> was declared insolvent. The thrift lost $ 144 million through its securities transactions with <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION>. The appellate court also threw out the lower court's order that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> pay $ 22 million in restitution to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and $ 250,000 in prosecution costs, and that <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> pay $ 25,000 in prosecution costs. The court said the cost and restitution penalties were based on a statement of fees submitted by the state that had not been certified as correct and legal. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s special prosecutor who obtained the convictions, said the state will appeal. `` The court's decision is based on technical, procedural issues, not the merits of the guilt or innocence of the defendants,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. Before it collapsed, Home State had about $ 1.4 billion in assets and served about 92,000 depositors in the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> areas. The savings bank was sold and reopened in June 1985. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> temporarily closed the other thrifts and ordered them to obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with companies that had it before reopening.

Storms in the area generated wind estimated at 80 to 100 mph, the weather service said. The thunderstorms developed along and ahead of a strong cold front and swept eastward from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms crossing northeastern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> whipped up high wind which blew away metal roofing being installed on a high school gymnasium at <ORGANIZATION> Lepanto </ORGANIZATION> and dumped hail up to 2 inches in diameter at <LOCATION> Leachville </LOCATION>. Heavy thunderstorms, possibly a tornado, struck the north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Palmetto </LOCATION> late Wednesday, causing extensive damage, authorities said. In central and southwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, thunderstorms packing winds up to 66 mph destroyed barns and a trailer home and tore the roofs off several buildings. Some injuries but no fatalities were reported. An afternoon thunderstorm in east-central <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> formed a tornado which damaged at least one home, and the Clay County Sheriff's office said an unknown number of people were injured in one house. Thunderstorms sweeping across <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> spun off a tornado in southeastern Madison Country, and dropped hail as big as baseballs north of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the weather service said. Hail stones as big as tennis balls fell near <LOCATION> Huntingburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, the weather service said. The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was 1.22 inches at <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.

Severe thunderstorms also developed over <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> during the afternoon, and the weather service reported a tornado north of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>. Other showers and thunderstorms, with locally heavy rain, were widely scattered along the northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> Light snow associated with an arctic cold front extended from eastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and northeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> into western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Snow also fell across parts of northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. As much as 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible by Thursday morning along the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> shore of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Strong northwesterly wind ushering the cold air into the north-central states gusted above 40 mph during the afternoon, creating wind chill readings colder than 25 degrees below zero. Snow, high wind and rapidly falling temperatures associated with the cold front briefly produced near-blizzard conditions in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> late Wednesday morning. Unseasonably warm weather continued in the East with afternoon readings in the 60s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and in the 80s over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.

 A communist deputy in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has turned in his party card and resigned from the communist caucus in the legislature, state television reported Wednesday. A report on the evening news said the deputy, <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Czernobilski </PERSON>, had informed caucus leader <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> of his resignation in a letter. <PERSON> Czernobilski </PERSON> did not give any explanation in the letter why he was quitting the party, but thanked his colleagues for their past cooperation, the report said. It is the latest setback for the beleaguered communist party, which became the first in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to lose control of the government on Aug. 24 when former Solidarity editor <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was named prime minister. The communists were battered in partially free elections in June and recently lost control of the mayoral office in the provincial city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>. Thousands of party members turned in their cards after the Solidarity trade union was legalized after a seven-year ban this April. Following the devastating loss of power and prestige, the party has decided that it should completely retool itself, starting with a name change. But hard-liners are resisting reform, and the changes are not expected before a party congress scheduled for January. According to parliamentary rules, <PERSON> Czernobilski </PERSON> could join another caucus or remain as an independent.

<HEAD>Migrant Workers Fall Ill From Pesticide Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUSKIN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 100 migrant farmworkers were treated for vomiting, dizziness and heart and breathing problems Wednesday after they were exposed to a toxic pesticide in a cauliflower field, officials said. Morning workers at Goodson Farms began falling ill as soon as they entered a 16-acre field which had been sprayed the previous afternoon with the pesticide phosdrin, farm employees said. `` This is a pesticide we use all the time. As soon as it's dry, it's safe to go in there,'' said farm manager <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON>. `` But this morning, one got sick and pretty soon they all started getting sick.'' Phosdrin is a common, though highly toxic, pesticide sprayed on a wide variety of agricultural crops to control worms. The label warns that fields sprayed with it should not be entered without protective clothing for at least 48 hours, said <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Brew </PERSON>, a pesticide education specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s cooperative extension service `` Sometimes we go in about an hour after spraying, so long as it's dry,'' Almond said. `` This did n't stop us. We got people back out there now.'' The workers wore protective boots and gloves to protect them from any pesticide residue, he said. Crew managers at the farm began taking the first workers to a rural clinic, and later ambulances were dispatched to bring in more. `` The pesticide enters through the skin, so we first had to strip their clothes off, shower them and wrap them in sheets,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> Ruskin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were covered with it.'' Most of the workers suffered from vomiting, dizziness and blurred vision, with a handful showing breathing and heartbeat problems, said Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, adding that a total of 77 had come through the clinic by late afternoon. Four patients were admitted to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with depressed heartbeats and breathing problems, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Oona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. About 25 others were treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, with the rest treated at the clinic, officials said. Almond said the workers were in the fields tying leaves around the cauliflower to keep the fleshy part of the plants from yellowing. The plants were scheduled to be harvested in about eight days.

 A previously unknown group said Wednesday it had kidnapped an American woman and two naturalized West Germans _ a man born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and his 7-year-old son. The claim was made in a typewritten statement, in Arabic, for a group calling itself The Organization of Just Revenge. The statement was delivered to a Western news agency with photocopies of the passports and visas of the three people. It identified the American as <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and described her as a publisher-journalist. The two others were identified as <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>, 39, born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and his son, <PERSON> Danjel </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` The Organization of Just Revenge announces its responsibility for kidnapping the West German <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> -LRB- born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB- and his son <PERSON> Danjel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> and American publisher-journalist <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for their activities in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' it said. No demands were made in the poorly typed statement, which gave no details and did not say when the abduction occurred. The kidnapping could not be confirmed. Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> would be the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman abducted in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and one of only a few women of any nationality. Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said that in a letter she received last week her daughter said she was going to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with someone named <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON> and wrote: `` I'm going to use <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON>'s connections to the hilt,'' referring to diplomatic friends he had in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It seems to me to me a chance in a lifetime.'' Ms. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said her daughter referred to <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON> as her `` therapist and really good friend.'' Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 59, also of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said in an interview that her sister chose the name Fahrend, which means traveling or itinerant in German, as a pen name while living in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> several years ago. `` She tackles life pretty much head-on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said. `` She would be unaware of danger in thinking of going to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, instead thinking of the opportunities for professional advancement.'' She described the family's reaction as `` a state of shock.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>, a friend of Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geronimo </LOCATION>, a town 20 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> where she is said to have lived until 1987, said they last met when her friend visited in June. She said the description `` publisher-journalist'' surprised her. She said Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON>, who she indicated was divorced and had two daughters, was a registered nurse and sometime poet. `` She traveled extensively and was a poet _ wrote poetry about the places she visited,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the department had no information on Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> and `` we're trying to find out if she had a waiver on her passport.'' Americans are prohibited from traveling to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> without such a waiver of the rules. The documents showed one-entry visas issued for Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> and the two Germans by Consul <PERSON> Michelene </PERSON> <PERSON> Baz </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, on Nov. 1. Attempts to reach Ms. <PERSON> Baz </PERSON> on Wednesday night were unsuccessful. Other Lebanese diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said further details about the visa applications would be available Thursday morning. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said he had no information on the kidnappings. The American Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been closed since Sept. 22. The documents also showed entry stamps by the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security department at the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, dated Nov. 3, an indication the three traveled from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> together by sea. No information was available on whether they remained in the Christian sector or crossed to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before their abduction. The West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said it had no knowledge of the abduction until the statement was released after nightfall. If the kidnapping is confirmed, Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON> would be the only Western woman now held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where women have been kidnapped only rarely. One was <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, daughter of French hostage <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, who was kidnapped with her father in 1985 by <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem group loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and released 12 hours later. Carton was held more than three years later. Ms. <PERSON> Fahrend </PERSON>'s father was identified in the visa photocopy as <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and her mother as <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Her passport was issued in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Oct. 15, 1984. Eighteen other foreigners are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 42, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian factions.

 An American tourist was hacked to death when a man with a history of mental illness attacked her as she was hiking up a mountain on this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island, authorities said Wednesday. The Tourist Board said <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDoom </PERSON>, who according to police was mentally ill, on Tuesday fatally cut <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> with a machete in the southwestern town of <LOCATION> Soufriere </LOCATION>, 26 miles from <LOCATION> Castries </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, in her 30s, unmarried and believed to be a dual citizen of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, suffered a severed arm and died shortly after the attack. Her hometown was not immediately known, the Tourist Board said. She was with a group of six tourists attempting to scale the 2,461-foot Petit Piton mountain, a main tourist attraction here. `` It is understood that the group divided, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a male companion resting whilst the main group continued,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` McDoom apparently harassed Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and her companion who went to seek assitance from the other members of the group. During his brief absence, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was attacked and fatally wounded.'' <PERSON> McDoom </PERSON> was taken into custody, police said. Charges are pending. The incident came exactly one year after a British tourist, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, was shot to death during a holdup at a picnic. Last month, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON>, 35, was sentenced to hang for the murder. In 1988, more than 214,000 tourists visited this island of 140,000 people, where tourism is the main foreign exchange-earner.

The two charges against <PERSON> Eastabrook </PERSON>, 28, alleged that between October 1986 and April he stole almost 100 items and illegally sold them to Military Surplus Brokers, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> front in <LOCATION> Roy </LOCATION>. In the plea-bargain, <PERSON> Eastabrook </PERSON> pleaded guilty to both charges, but to stealing slightly more than $ 3,900 rather than the $ 5,304 he originally had been charged with. The remaining goods were apparently items he had been issued, officials said. Lawyers on both sides said military justice rules prevented them from discussing the plea-bargain. Three other <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> enlisted men have gone through special courts-martial on charges they illegally sold military supplies. Two were acquitted and one was found guilty, demoted and sentenced to a month in jail. On Tuesday, another <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> security policeman pleaded guilty to three counts of theft of government property.

 A scene in a Parisian tavern that <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> painted when he was 25 in exchange for free meals and drinks sold for $ 40.7 million at auction Wednesday. The 1905 painting `` Au Lapin Agile,'' in which <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> depicts himself as a harlequin, is `` the most important 20th-century picture to come up for auction,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It goes to the Annenberg Collection,'' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> said as he hammered down the sale. <PERSON> Southeby </PERSON>'s had predicted the work would fetch $ 35 million to $ 40 million. The auction house said the painting will go to the private collection of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> of Rancho Mirage, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the philanthropist and former owner of <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, a close friend of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The painting was consigned by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roulet </PERSON>, daughter of art collector <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Payson </PERSON>, who acquired it in 1952 and hung it in her <LOCATION> Manhasset </LOCATION> home. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roulet </PERSON> said in a statement she felt `` Au Lapin Agile'' has become too valuable a painting to keep. `` I plan to establish a foundation for medical research and education with part of the proceeds,'' she added. `` Au Lapin Agile'' was painted four years after another famous self-portrait, `` Yo Picasso,'' which sold for $ 47.85 million at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in May. That was a record for the artist and more than double its presale estimate. The record for any work of art _ $ 53.9 million _ was set in 1987 for <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises,'' also from the <PERSON> Payson </PERSON> collection. Several other paintings were on the block Wednesday: _ <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of sleeping women done in 1932, was expected to bring up to $ 25 million _ `` Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from 1921 _ the year of the birth of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s son _ is estimated at up to $ 15 million. _ A <ORGANIZATION> Renoir </ORGANIZATION> pastel, `` Young Girls at the Piano,'' produced in 1892 on a commission from the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government, did not sell Wednesday It had been expected to bring up to $ 30 million. _ <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in 1889, was estimated to bring up to $ 15 million _ Major pieces by <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondrian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON> were being auctioned from the collection of the late <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON> The 21 pieces were expected to bring between $ 30 million and $ 40 million. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s president, described `` Au Lapin Agile'' as a large, powerful, serious painting, one of the most important of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s rose period. In addition, she said, `` The subject has a story behind it.'' Done when he was 25, the painting shows <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and a woman _ model <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichot </PERSON> _ standing at a bar, brooding and obviously disenchanted with one another. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Pichot </PERSON> as being the cause of his best friend's suicide four years earlier `` The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time it was painted <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> was actually having an affair with this woman himself,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. In the background is <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>, the owner of the tavern Lapin Agile -LRB- Sprightly Rabbit -RRB- and the painting's first owner. A photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed in the bar.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, saluted on his historic visit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with cheers, whistles and four standing ovations, declared Wednesday that American aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` will not be wasted, and will never be forgotten.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> a few hours later, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, `` I am an optimist'' that the economic assistance promised by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will enable the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc to survive. `` I think we will have enough time,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made his remarks on a day in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed him as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s special guest.'' He was treated exactly that way, from his historic appearance before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the morning to a private meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in the afternoon and a dinner back in the Capitol at the end of the day. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left that dinner early, saying that he was exhausted. In his speech before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he asked for more investment to help pull a bankrupt Polish economy from `` the verge of utter catastrophe'' and said such assistance in peacetime is `` better than tanks, warships and warplanes.'' In an emotional speech recounting the nine-year struggle of his union to form a democratic government, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gave thanks to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for years of support and words of admiration. `` These are appreciated, but being a worker and a man of concrete work, I must tell you that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful, but the demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now,'' said the mustachioed 46-year-old former shipyard electrician. In the interview, he said he was `` uncomfortable'' when asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was doing too little to aid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, as charged by congressional Democrats. `` I, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, chairman of Soldarity, am happy, glad with what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing now. I am grateful for what he is doing and for his assistance in our reforms,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` I can say in unequivocal terms, he is a friend of Soldarity.'' But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` very careful. He is checking what he can do'' and `` first all his responsibility is to this country and nobody can have anything against that.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who wraps up his visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, also made a joint appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> convention with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who hailed him as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s special guest'' and promised more aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Clearly there are times when the need for progress demands that we put differences aside, and where <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is concerned, now is such a time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Today, I appeal to the unions and on the American labor movement, the business community, and government to look for ways to support a partnership for progress in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the sake of a nation and a people that need and deserve our help,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, addressing a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, drew resounding applause when he said that `` assistance extended to democracy and freedom in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the best investment in the future of peace, better than tanks, warships and warplanes, an investment leading to greater security.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday for a four-day visit marked by numerous awards and a torrent of praise as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other East European nations rapidly institute democratic and market reforms. In more concrete action, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to authorize $ 657 million in economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> over three years and $ 81 million for nearby <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, also dismantling its centrally controlled economy. The House went further, approving an initial one-year installment of $ 533 million for the two Soviet bloc nations. `` The decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about granting economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> opens a new road,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` For this wonderful decision, I thank you warmly. I promise that this aid will not be wasted and will never be forgotten.'' The steps to send economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have been accompanied by personal adulation for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday, an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> human rights award on Tuesday, and on Wednesday became the second foreign private citizen to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the first since the Marquis de <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> in 1824. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber was packed with senators, representatives, members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet, staff members, journalists, and even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, who carefully read <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s prepared text and applauded the delivery. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> were on the dais, and the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and other dignitaries sat to one side. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> entered the chamber at 11:04 EST, and received a five-minute standing ovation punctuated by a few whoops and whistles as he flashed his trademark `` V'' for victory sign. His remarks were translated by <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalabinski </PERSON>, an emigre Solidarity activist who was once accused of treason by the former communist government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> clearly relished his warm welcome as a representative of Polish democracy before `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which for many people in the world, oppressed and stripped of their rights, is a beacon of freedom and a bulwark of human rights.'' He began his remarks with the opening words of the preamble to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> constitution, `` We the People. ...'' `` I do not need to explain that I, an electrician from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, am also entitled to invoke them,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity's success was attracting imitators throughout the communist world, and inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself, among `` Hungarians, Russians, the Ukrainians, people of the Baltic republics, Armenians and Georgians, and in recent days, the East Germans.'' `` We wish them luck and rejoice at each success they achieve,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> praised Soviet reforms, and said `` our task is viewed with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their leader, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' `` This understanding lays foundations for new relation

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rushed a temporary spending bill to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to keep government agencies from shutting down and falling victim to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' inability to finish its budget business on time. On a 296-122 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which later adopted the measure on a voice vote. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to sign the bill. The legislation provides money to keep federal programs functioning through Monday. Otherwise, their spending authority would have expired at the end of business Wednesday. The stopgap measure is necessary because lawmakers have failed to finish the package of 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. So far, five of the bills have been signed into law; two have been vetoed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; four are on the president's desk awaiting his signature, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is working on two others. `` At times it seems like we've been assigned the task of rolling rocks up a hill, only to have those rocks roll back,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations Committee Congressional leaders hope to have finished work on all 13 spending bills by Monday. If not, yet another stopgap measure will be needed. Lawmakers hope to complete their work for the year by Wednesday and adjourn until January. The legislation is the third time in the last two months that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has had to extend temporary spending authority. Lawmakers passed one measure Sept. 28 providing stopgap funds through Oct. 25, and a second on Oct. 25. That measure expired Wednesday.

 <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, convicted murderers with a bent for writing, won fame in the late 1970s and early'80s with articles in the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> magazine The Angolite. The writings that concerns them today include legal briefs filed in <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s $ 100,000 federal lawsuit against <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, accusing him of plagiarism in a book he edited and of trying to damage <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s journalistic reputation. `` Everything in this book was done properly,'' said <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, who still is editor of The Angolite. `` I did n't claim to write anything I did n't. `` Neither I, nor anyone else, has tried to damage <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s journalistic reputation He did that to himself back in 1986 when he became an undercover agent for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> while he was working as a journalist.'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, 44, now jailed at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, said the lawsuit was a last resort. `` The only thing I want is for the credit for my work to be protected and for <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> not to claim the things I did. `` Nobody putting together a book using that many articles from the Angolite could help but assume some of them were mine.'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s death sentence for a 1965 murder during a bungled holdup was commuted to life in prison after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s death penalty law. He left The Angolite in 1986 after going to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> when he was approached by a prison employee who tried to sell him a pardon. In the ensuing scandals, the head of the pardon board was sent to prison. `` I had three choices,'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said. `` I could accept it, ignore it, or report it to officials. If I had tried to report it within the system I would have been dead in 30 days. If I had tried to report it as a journalist they would have tried to discredit what I did or lock me up.'' After he cooperated in the investigation, he was transferred out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for his safety. He received a clemency recommendation from the state <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, but Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, taking a hard line on crime, rejected it. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON>, 47, has been at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since he was condemned to die for a 1961 bank robbery in which he killed a teller by slitting her throat. His sentence was also commuted to life when the death penalty was thrown out. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s lawsuit centers on a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> text, `` The Wall Is Strong: Corrections In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' that <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> edited with <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a professor, and another Angolite editor, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wikberg </PERSON>. The textbook is a compilation of newspaper and magazine articles and papers by the school's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. About half is from The Angolite. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> contends that four of the articles should have carried his byline. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> acknowledged that one should have. `` He won the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> award, the Silver Gavel Award from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 for ` A Prison Tragedy.' Leaving his name off it was an innocent mistake. Hell, my name was left off ` Sexual Jungle,' which I won the George Polk award for. There are a lot of mistakes in the book. We had to put it together by phone and letters. It's not like we could take off and go to the printers every time we needed to.'' No matter who wrote them, <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> said, ownership may belong to the state. `` We're prisoners. We were sent to prison to work and to suffer. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> was sentenced to hard labor. He got a break and was sent to The Angolite but he was paid for that work just as if he had gone anywhere else. Can the guy who makes license plates claim they're his Can the prisoner who picks cotton go to the warden and tell him how to use that cotton?'' The book is sold only at the university bookstore. At $ 26.95, it is not expected to make more than a few hundred dollars, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. Even if it does make a profit, the money will go to the school. <PERSON> Rideau </PERSON> said he gets nothing from it but satisfaction, tainted now by the suit he said reflects <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s bitterness at being out of the limelight. Meanwhile, The Angolite, which was a finalist for the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> 1989 National Magazine Award and, along with <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s, received the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> award for journalism, has rebuilt its credibility, he said. `` I have no war with <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> and I do n't want one. I understand there has always been a certain resentment and jealousy on his part. It's sad when trying to be like someone turns to envy.'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said he has no reason for envy, just worry about his work. `` We were very close at one time. What <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> did for me when I was in jail was brought to the attention of a lot of people and I'm very grateful This has never been a personal vendetta on my part. He's the one that made it a vendetta. When I read that book, though, I realized the only way I can protect my work is to go to court.''

 <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, whose ancestors lived and farmed in this rural <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> community before the American Revolution, is learning a hard lesson about rebellion: Governments often fight back. Sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn being sued, by lawmakers. `` I've been thinking a lot about <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. `` I have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here. `` If they can put up with it, so can I.'' Residents sued <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and adjoining <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year over the proposed incinerator, which is to be built in <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, to burn garbage for both counties. They contend that local officials approved the plan without a proper public hearing. The counties and their industrial development agency countersued, seeking $ 1.5 million from 320 plaintiffs, most of them <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> later dropped out, but <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> remain. The residents, recognizable around the area by the bright orange `` PLAINTIFF'' bumper stickers affixed to their cars, say the countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit. Environmentalists say it could have national implications for other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge controversial projects. The environmental movement even has a name for it _ a SLAPP suit, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. `` It's a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking out,'' said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, who led the fight over the Love Canal toxic dump in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and now runs the Virginia-based Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. `` This case stands out as the only one of its kind that I know of where government chooses to sue its own people,'' said <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Collette </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s SLAPP suit expert. Other SLAPP suits, which <PERSON> Collete </PERSON> calls `` legal terrorism,'' have been brought across the country by private companies involved in projects. `` The idea is to squash the opposition.'' People who bring SLAPP suits do n't expect to win them, he said. `` They all get dropped. They never go to trial. <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has no expectation of winning its case.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, some supervisors told people they might lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit, the plaintiffs claim. `` They're trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a handful of manageable troublemakers,'' said <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being sued. The countersuit contends the citizens' lawsuit was frivolous and that actions by the incinerator opponents, during the sale of bonds for the project, cost the counties $ 1.5 million. `` At the original closing date for the bond sale, there were committed purchasers. As the result of the activities of the citizens, those contracts were abrogated, it was necessary to enter into new contracts, and passage of time and a change in the market brought a $ 1.5 million loss,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Glens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> lawyer for the counties and IDA. That loss increased the cost of the project and with it the cost of burning garbage. Now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the fray _ a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit against them. They've hired Atlanta-based civil rights lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Remar </PERSON>. `` The First Amendment to the Constitution gives all of us the right to freedom of speech, freedom of association and the right to petition government for redress of grievances,'' said <PERSON> Remar </PERSON>. `` When a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having exercised those rights, that's a violation of the Constitution.'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said the counterclaim does n't violate anyone's civil rights. `` They have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings and actions being taken by the government. They have a right to sue their government if they feel that something is done improperly. But they do n't have the right to ... perform in such a fashion that they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has with third parties and cause a $ 1.5 million loss.'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, said he supports the counterclaim, as has a majority of that board every time someone moves to drop it. `` I have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on this issue,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` But there are 110,000 people in these two counties. We have some obligation to the other 100,000 people.'' While the lawsuits go on over the $ 80 million incinerator _ resolution is n't expected until some time next year _ excavation is nearing completion at the plant site next to the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The main point of the original lawsuit, whether there was a public hearing on the project, is still in dispute. While <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said a hearing was n't required, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said the two-county IDA held one. <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON>, another active incinerator opponent, said the <ORGANIZATION> IDA </ORGANIZATION> hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone was n't allowed to speak. `` The public hearing was a sham,'' said <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON>, who has been known to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors' meetings. `` They let 11 people speak out of 49 ... Then they just banged the gavel and that was it.''

 <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON> confesses he had never read <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` A Tale of Two Cities'' until he was asked to star in a new four-part miniseries for television. In the story of the French Revolution, <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON> stars as the ill-fated Dr. <PERSON> Manette </PERSON>, who was confined for 18 years in the Bastille. He was imprisoned for denouncing two aristocrats who had fatally wounded a young couple he had treated. The Anglo-French production of `` A Tale of Two Cities'' begins Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Masterpiece Theatre'' on PBS. It also stars <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilby </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuc </PERSON> as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnay </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> as Miss <PERSON> Pross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriegel </PERSON> as <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Defarge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> as her husband and <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bory </PERSON> as the Marquis de St. Evremonde. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Monnier </PERSON> directed. `` It is a huge book and I had never read it,'' said <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON>. `` It took me many days to get through it, but it was worth it.'' Dr. <PERSON> Manette </PERSON> is in poor health when he is released from the Bastille. His daughter, <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON>, takes him to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to recover his health. Later, <PERSON> Manette </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnay </PERSON>, is arrested and, <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON> explained, `` He returns to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to save his life, which he does.'' The series was filmed in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which stood in for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think they could have done it in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` They had to find a place where the streets had not changed.'' The French-born <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON> began his career on the stage in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at the age of 17. He co-starred with <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> in `` Roseberg.'' At the start of World War II he returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I fought in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and landed in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I landed with the Americans and for one whole day I was the only French soldier in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. After the war, I returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and made more films.'' He co-starred with <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Lili </PERSON>,'' and on Broadway he co-starred with <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> in `` Tovarich'' and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> in `` Camino Real.'' <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON> talked about the miniseries on a brief visit from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he lives with his wife, <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavan </PERSON>. They have three children, all of whom are American citizens. One son lives here and a son and daughter live in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He recently completed a movie filmed in <LOCATION> Aix-en-Provence </LOCATION> called `` The Fighting Frenchman.'' `` It's about the war and the Resistance and the collaboration,'' he said. `` I play a man who is beginning to believe in Marshal <PERSON> Petain </PERSON> and think the Germans are n't so bad. Then he has a change of heart and becomes a follower of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>. `` When I met with the director he told me it would be the story of a man who enlists in the Free French Forces. I said, ` Oh, that's easy That's what I did in real life.' There was a long silence and he said, ` Yes, but you play the father.' I had simply forgotten about my age.'' Another completed film due for release soon is `` Les Grandes Familles.'' In recent years, <PERSON> Aumont </PERSON> has appeared on French television regularly and on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> TV in such shows as `` <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'' and `` The Love Boat.'' `` I did ` <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>' on the stage in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a year,'' he said. `` That was great fun. I had seven songs and I'm not really a singer. I told my agent, ` I'm not a singer.' He said, ` What about <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>? What about <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevalier </PERSON>?' I let myself be easily convinced.''

<HEAD>Exiled Painter, Rural Sculptor Captivate Johannesburg Art World</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two elderly black men _ one an exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the other a faith healer from a tiny village _ are being heralded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-dominated art establishment as two of the country's greatest artists. By coincidence, the first major retrospective exhibitions of <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekoto </PERSON>'s paintings and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlungwani </PERSON>'s sculptures are simultaneously on display this month in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Critics have greeted both with superlative praise. One reviewer described the Hlungwani show as `` the most important sculpture exhibition yet held in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sekoto </PERSON>, wrote another critic, `` is one of the greatest figures of 20th-century South African art.'' Sekoto, 75, lives in a home for retired artists outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and has not returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since going into self-imposed exile in 1947. His finest works, critics agree, are gentle scenes of black urban life painted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the eight years before he emigrated. Many of his paintings depict black and mixed-race inner-city neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> that later were razed by the government and reconstructed as whites-only districts. The exhibition of 138 of his works, many of them loaned from private collections, has drawn large crowds to the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, the largest exhibition facility in the country's largest city. `` It has taken about as long for Sekoto to attain public recognition in his own native country as it has for the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> Art Gallery to wake up to the fact that whites can never carry the full weight of this country's political, economic and cultural self-fulfillment,'' said <PERSON> Eskia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mphahlele </PERSON>, a friend of the painter and former professor of African literature at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION>, at the opening of the exhibition. The New Nation, an anti-apartheid newspaper, said in its review that for decades <PERSON> Sekoto </PERSON> was deprived of proper recognition `` because of the one-sided focus which was placed on the work of white artists by galleries, critics, art historians and authorities blindfolded by apartheid.'' <PERSON> Hlungwani </PERSON>, 66, is the son of a mineworker, never had formal education, has 12 children, and lost a finger in an industrial accident when he worked as a laborer. He says he decided to take up sculpting after experiencing a religious vision. `` I do the work of God by carving,'' he said in an interview earlier this year. `` Art comes from all my body.'' Most of his works are carved from wood found in the area around two improvised temples he has built in a village in <LOCATION> Gazankulu </LOCATION>, a black homeland near <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s northeastern border with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. His creations include angels, crucifixes and many fish _ which he considers an important Christian symbol. More than 200 of his works are on display at a converted industrial warehouse in one of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s oldest districts. `` His sculptures have transformed an ordinary old factory ... into a magical place of reverence,'' wrote <PERSON> Kendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Geers </PERSON>, a critic for The Star, the country's largest-selling daily. `` The show certainly sets a standard for South African art for the future.'' The New Nation has devoted full-page spreads to each of the shows. `` It's an exciting and joyful time for art lovers in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said. `` Two current exhibitions, both unforgettable, are giving them the first comprehensive look at two of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s greatest artists.''

 Still water runs deep for <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>, the high, clear voice of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>, and `` Still Water'' is the title of his new book of prose poems. `` Does it help to feel better about a painful memory by writing about it? Not really. It does n't have anything to do with it,'' he said. Some of the 84 poems in the book concern the suicide of his girlfriend, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, in 1979. `` It seems that the artists' agenda is to be true to feelings and emotions, fearlessly, so that we can all recognize ourselves,'' he said in an interview. `` Fearlessly is the key word. `` We give ourselves a catharsis by recognizing the many colors of human nature, including the darks. My notion of such an artist is one who has the bravery to deal with the complexity of the human heart and psyche. That's where I'm coming from, to the best of my ability.'' From 1983 through 1987, the poetry muse kept biting <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>. `` Then the pen dried up. I know what the reason is. In 1987 I started making the ` Lefty' album. I was moving from the world of words to the world of music. I guess I reorganized my creative impulses to a new direction.'' <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Jules </PERSON>, urged him to take his poems to editor <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who thought they should be a book, which has been published by E.P. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>. `` The poems are in four categories, that's how I look at them,'' he said. `` One is the spirit of traveling. One is how I work.'' Poems 59 through 65 concern `` The Animals' Christmas,'' an album of songs by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, sung by <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in 1986. `` One is philosophical speculations. The fourth category is memory of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>. Catharsis is a notion I find popular. I do n't know if I can connect with that. Had I never written about her, would I have been more blocked? I would have thought all these things. My friends know how deeply I was affected by her, when I loved her and when I lost her. `` Time makes things fade,'' <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> said. `` I love <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> now. The memory of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> is mercifully fading. It is giving me a break. I have a chance to live life now. When I wrote these, in the mid -'80s, is not really where I'm at now On Sept. 18, 1988, <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON> were married in the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Botanical Garden. She had sung in the group Lime, worked as a model and currently is developing a solo show. `` I had a real fear of marriage,'' <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> said. `` I was one of the real tough cases. When it came to trust in that area, only the great <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> could have relaxed me on that, with a lot of love and niceness. `` I'm sure I'm the millionth person to fear the wonderful. If something comes along that offers you a major increase in your life, you say, ` Can I get back to you on this?' `` The day I said, ` I'm going to marry <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>,' was the day I clarified my life. ... I've been so reclusive in the'80s. I've been reclusive long enough. That does n't mean that he'll start writing songs. `` I once had seven or eight lines of a poem and I liked the way it laid. I thought, ` Let me turn it into a song.' After two hours of laboring, all the inspiration dried up.'' But he may tour more. In 1988 <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> toured with British musicians in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. This fall he's singing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I'm trying out a leaner musical line. I'm going to try to work with one guitar and one piano, often not playing at the same time, on what I call ` the less-is-more tour.' If I can be in really good voice, let me clear out the backing so I can be heard in all my nuances.'' In January, he'll do 12 shows in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with a full band. In the past, he has done more recording than live concerts. `` The studio has always been the fun for me. You're working against your own perfectionism. You can erase it till it's right. `` But I've cooled out. When we -LRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> -RRB- were in junior high school, we wanted a hit. The desire to have a hit calms down after you have success.'' <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> likes to travel. `` I like to ventilate my intensity. I want air, elbow room and the sweep of nature as an antidote. I like crossing the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> by ship after recordiing in a studio.'' He also is walking across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a bit at a time. He left his apartment one day, crossed the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, walked for nine days and came home, picking up later exactly where he left off in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> came along in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. I usually do it myself. I'm now about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I take the smallest paved roads I find. In general, human kindness goes up in the smaller areas. In remote areas, more people stop and offer a ride.'' <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> always refuses. He admits that his walk is `` the rich man's way to do it.'' He goes with an assistant who rents a car. When it's dark, the assistant picks <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> up and backtracks to the nearest motel. <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, with whom relations have sometimes been strained, a copy of his book. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he liked it. `` He's a man of integrity,'' <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> said. `` He could have avoided saying anything. `` We went to a Yankee game last summer. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> sat between us. It was really nice. There's nothing like time. It does it's own sweet, soothing thing.''

<HEAD>Advisers Would Raise the Quayle Profile, Avoid Another Dent to Image</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.(AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To a golfer, a mulligan is a second chance, an invitation to hit a bad shot over again and pretend the first one never happened. Golfing with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he did n't want one because `` mulligans are for Democrats.'' There are no mulligans in national politics, where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> might find one handy now and then. In that arena, any errant move is marked indelibly on the scorecard. That means no mistakes go unpenalized, especially for a political figure whose confidence and performance ratings are persistently low, as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s are. That pressure does n't let up; one associate sees the stress on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the vice president strives to boost his standing, knowing that any slipup or misspoken word will be magnified into another dent in the image. At the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference this week, even the praise pointed to the problem. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s friends were at pains to plug his performance and his potential as a national leader, even when it did n't quite fit the moment. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> introducing him at a casual Sunday night reception, said the vice president `` will make a very fine place in history.'' Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> tossed into his remarks to the governors on Monday the observation that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` is doing a very fine job and could not have more confidence and support from the president.'' In such situations, some Republicans are protesting too much. After all, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has solid backing where it really counts. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said flatly that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be his 1992 running mate. That gives the vice president seven years to do his job and enhance his standing. In the changeable world of politics, that is a very long time _ half again as long as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s entire political career to date. Even though the adverse polls clearly sting, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is up to a joke about his political standing. `` A year and one week ago, President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rode to victory on my coattails,'' he told the governors. He spoke of his wife's interest in disaster relief efforts: `` <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> has a lot of experience in disaster preparedness; she's lived with me for 17 years.'' But the banter is n't always easy in the face of public opinion surveys indicating that a majority of Americans do not think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> qualified to succeed to the presidency, which is a vice president's one crucial role, and that nearly half think he should be replaced on the 1992 Republican ticket President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that will not happen, making the commitment publicly. `` He's doing a very good job, an oustanding job ... exactly what I want him to do,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News early this month. The vice president says unfavorable polls will not affect the way he does his job. `` I'm not going to do anything differently no matter what the polls say,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday in an interview with a group of reporters. `` I'm going to work as I believe a vice president should work, that is, first and foremost, with complete loyalty to the president, for the advancement of his agenda, in his interest, and that's what I'm doing.'' That job description does not preclude a more aggressive effort to strengthen his own standing and improve his own image. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his allies have maintained that his image problem stems largely from memories of the Democratic attack on him during the 1988 campaign, but it has been over a year now and the numbers are n't any better As a result, some <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> advisers want him to raise his television profile, appearing more frequently on the talk and question-and-answer programs. Those appearances have been held to a handful during the first year of the administration. There may be more in the months ahead. And there certainly will be more political outings in 1990, with 34 senators, 36 governors and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> all up for election. Campaigning for party candidates is a traditional assignment for vice presidents. That means the voters will be seeing more of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. They'll know him better; his challenge is to convince them to like him better

<HEAD>Ford's Executive Succession Plan Almost Unique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The realignment of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>'s executive suite, in which an older chief executive will replace a younger one and the four top positions will be held by men age 55 or older, is almost unique in recent history. It has upset patterns established over three decades, conceivably put another one in motion and presented a challenge to those who analyze and seek to understand the executive suite. `` It is the most unusual succession pattern of the 35 years in which I have audited executive mobility and succession in top corporations,'' said Professor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, an authority on such matters. Older executives have been favored over youth in the past, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said, but usually because directors lacked confidence that younger ones were ready, or because a company was rebuilding and sought to avoid radical change. He indicated this was not the situation at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and speculated that a feeling developing on corporate boards _ that many companies are losing experience and wisdom through early retirements _ may have played a role. In the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> realignment, chairman and chief executive <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, 63, will resign early in 1990 and be replaced by Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>, 64. The chief executive's office also would include <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 60, as president and chief operating officer, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmour </PERSON>, 55, as head of worldwide automotive works, and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Seneker </PERSON>, 58, as chief financial officer. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of management and a consultant to boards on succession policy, said that over the past three decades the typical age has been 55 years for new chairmen and 48 years for new presidents. In his view, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>'s age presents him with a difficult situation in which he is denied the `` open-ended tenure'' that a new chief executive usually needs in which to make an imprint. That situation could become more complicated, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> believes, because history shows that in the rare instances in which corporations preferred age over youth the seasoning of younger executives was impeded and frustrated. If <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> has indeed ushered in a cultural revolution at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, `` then now is the time to use some of these senior positions to grow future top management.'' That `` is what conventional planning dictates.'' Noting that the chief executive's office now will be filled by four finance-oriented managers, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> observed it would be logical that a marketing or manufacturing executive be moved in among them to benefit from their knowledge. In the past when older financial people remained in top positions, said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, it usually indicated the corporate directors felt the risk of change far outweighed the need for fresh ideas. He noted that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier became the most profitable American automobile company, recently suffered declines in its quarterly profits and that it might indeed feel the future demands financial wisdom and experience. But <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, who pioneered in mobility studies during the 1950s, said the notion can not be ruled out that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> might be in the vanguard of a new appreciation of age and competency.

 <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> wants a job. She wants a place to live in a drug-free neighborhood where she and her two toddlers will feel safe. And she wants to get off welfare. `` Ever since I've had these kids, I've had this fear _ that I'd always be financially dependent,'' said <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, 28 `` These kids are depending on me, and I do n't want to let them down.'' Despite a failed marriage, the lack of a job and no day care for her 2 -LCB- - year-old daughter and 1-year-old son, she has a better chance to fulfill that goal now, thanks to an experimental job training effort that rewards determination with cash bonuses `` I would love to get into computers,'' <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to try to be a word processor.'' Officials here in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, frustrated by the lack of participation in job-training programs, started a three-year pilot program in July offering cash incentives of up to $ 1,000 to motivate welfare recipients to go to school and get jobs. `` It's no longer good enough to just give people a -LRB- welfare -RRB- check,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caulk </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for the county, which borders <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We've got to do more to provide them with the wherewithal to get off of welfare, to break that cycle of dependence.'' The program, which targets those who have been receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children for at least three years and low-income teen-age parents, is the first in the nation to offer cash incentives for job training, Caulk said. Participants who complete a goal, such as consistently attending a training class or earning a high school equivalency diploma, receive payments ranging from $ 25 to $ 200, with a limit of $ 1,000 per person per year. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Departments of <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> agreed to waive requirements that would have deducted the incentive payments from welfare or food stamp payments. The program will cost nearly $ 1 million in federal, state and county funds, Caulk said. But the annual savings in welfare benefits alone would be about $ 5,000 for each three-member family that becomes economically self-sufficient, he said. Social workers set up goals and payments, taking into consideration each person's abilities and motivation level. `` We're trying to empower case managers to have the flexibility to say, ` For this client, just showing up five days in a row is an accomplishment,''' he said. `` That person would be rewarded at the end of five days. Somebody else may have a totally different kind of package. They may have to score well in word processing or assembly or retail training. Others may get one payment to complete the class.'' About 600 people will participate in the experimental program, with half receiving cash incentives and the other half acting as a control group. `` The federal government suggested we keep payments quiet'' so the control group would n't know others were receiving payments for completing the same tasks they did without pay, <ORGANIZATION> Caulk </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But that is impossible because they're all in the same classes, and we want them to discuss their progress and encourage each other.'' Wealthy <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has tried other projects in the past. Three years ago, it gave welfare recipients vouchers worth up to $ 250 to pay for food, utilities or other bills in exchange for their participation in job-training programs. The dropout rate was more than 50 percent. The federal government's approach to the problem is to require certain welfare recipients to attend job-training classes to keep their public assistance checks coming. But Caulk said even the threat of losing payments they now receive has not helped motivate some welfare recipients to seek advancement. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Family Support Act, requiring states to set up large-scale education, job-training and work programs to make welfare recipients self-sufficient. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> was the first state to implement the act in all counties, said <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shay </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, who added that state officials are optimistic about <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s program. `` We're anxious to see how the cash incentives will impact on the welfare recipients' participation, motivation and continuation in the program,'' he said. Federal officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude. `` We're not in favor of the program or against it, but if it is successful we'd like to see it tried in other areas,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Germanis </PERSON> of the federal Low-Income Opportunity Board, which includes officials from several federal agencies who are working to improve the nation's welfare system. `` And if it were to succeed in several areas, it could be used for reforming the national wefare system.'' Already, the program has surpassed Caulk's expectations. `` Our goal was to have 40 people in the first -LRB- job-training -RRB- class. So far, 61 people have enrolled,'' he said. `` Going on past experience, we could lose half in the next month.'' If the program works, however, the cash incentives would encourage them to stay, he said. `` This has never been tried before, so if we find that the payments make no difference, even that is worth knowing,'' Caulk said. `` Then we can sit down and think of something else to try.'' <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> said she is confident the program will work. `` When people ask me, ` What have you been up to?' I do n't say, ` Oh, nothin', just hangin' around.' I say: ` I've been busy. I'm going to school I'm going to get a job.''' And although she'd seek training even without being paid, she said, `` The money really comes in handy.''

 For some teen-agers, it's hard work not getting pregnant _ so hard they are being paid $ 1 a day for their efforts. Each Thursday afternoon, 13 teen-age girls pick up $ 7 and snack on chips and soda at the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mariposa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> clinic in the low-income, largely Hispanic neighborhood where most of them grew up. Twelve of them already have at least one child, and many bring their babies along. This is a program for girls who have gotten pregnant by age 16 and know the consequences of teen pregnancy firsthand. `` It's an incentive program and it's a support group,'' says <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, assistant director of Planned Parenthood of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, which sponsors the program. `` In the past two years, out of more than 20 girls, we've had only two pregnancies. That's really successful for the kind of group we're dealing with.'' The program has sparked interest around the country, and spawned a similar program in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> says. The girls use the weekly sessions to talk about child-rearing, school, dating _ providing each other the support that they might otherwise try to find having another baby, organizers say. Consciously or unconsciously, they are addicted to motherhood, says Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgan </PERSON>, a child psychologist at Children's Hospital who thought up the `` Dollar-A-Day'' program several years ago after directing a home for troubled youths and seeing a steady stream of teen mothers come through `` Their deprivation and emptiness _ their longing for something uniquely their own'' compels girls in their situation to get pregnant, <PERSON> Dolgan </PERSON> says. `` That, plus weak refusal skills and a passive understanding of their role as women.'' <PERSON> Dolgan </PERSON> says weekly support from others like them helps the girls overcome a psychological longing for a child. The money and refreshments are added incentive, a psychological ploy he says is too often overlooked in addressing the nationwide teen pregnancy problem. The girls do n't like seeing themselves as deprived, but some agree they wanted to get pregnant. `` My cousin had a baby and I felt I kind of lost her. I felt I needed someone with me all the time,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON>, 17, holding her 5-month-old son, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, on her lap at one Thursday afternoon session. Now, she attends high school through the city's <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which provides some day-care. She does n't want to get pregnant again, because she wants to become a veterinarian and to be able to provide for <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>, she said. <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON> said the money is n't the reason she and other girls come to the clinic each week, although `` it gives them something to think about.'' For her, the session `` gives me a chance to let some of my feelings out _ or if I need to know something about the babies'' _ things like teething and heat rash, or what to do when you want to go to school and ca n't find a babysitter. Planned Parenthood estimates the program costs about $ 600 per girl annually, paid for by donations. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> says that makes it a cheap alternative to teen pregnancy. Last year, Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>'s Initiative on Teen Pregnancy reported: `` The cost to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> totals over $ 200 million each year in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaid and other public assistance for families headed by women who began their childbearing as teens.'' The state health department reported that one in 10 babies born in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in 1987 was born to a teen-ager, and teen-age pregnancies resulted in more than 5,700 births and 3,000 abortions. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 17, has come to the sessions since her son, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, was born a year and a half ago. For her, it's a welcome break in a week filled with high school, a job at a grocery store and the responsibilities of motherhood. `` I did n't want to get pregnant, but I was happy because I like kids, especially newborns,'' she said. She enjoys being with the other girls. `` They're your same age and they have babies, too, so they know how you're feeling. `` A lot of girls think, ` I might as well have another baby since I ca n't go out and work much -LRB- with one child already -RRB-.' Here, you realize it'll be harder to take on another baby _ it'll stop your career life ... You just wo n't feel right living off of your parents or your in-laws.'' The girls, as young as 13, can stay in the Dollar-A-Day program for two years or until they are 18. Most take high-school classes, and some have jobs, counselor <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> says. Seven dollars a week does n't go far, but can pay for diapers or a snack on the way home, several girls said. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, unusual in the group in that she lives with her son's father, another teen-ager, said she used to spend the $ 7 a week on laundry and diapers, but now saves it for her son

 The coming decade will be rich in both challenge and opportunity: The greenhouse effect. Ozone. AIDS. The rich-poor gap. The genetic code. New materials. Superconductors. Supercomputers. This summary article is the final installment in a periodic series, `` The'90s,'' looking ahead to the upcoming 10 years in the environment, medicine, technology and society.

 In the decade of the 1990s, perhaps as never before, human fate rests in human hands. Few periods in history have presented such clear choices between promise and peril, and experts predict that civilization in the 21st century and beyond may well be shaped by global decisions made in the 1990s. `` Human beings now have the power to control their own fate to a degree that they've never had before,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, we do not know how to handle this power very well. We do n't have very well developed systems for managing the world as a whole.'' The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that monitors trends and forecasts their effects, annually surveys the views of specialists on the major problems in years ahead. Topping the list of challenges for the 1990s: environmental damage to the Earth's climate, land, water and atmosphere. `` In 1986, the cluster of environmental problems was No. 3 on this list of fears,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marien </PERSON>, editor of the survey. Now, he said, `` it has clearly become the leading problem area.'' World Watch, an environmental research organization, agrees with the assessment. In its annual `` State of the World,'' the organization calls the 1990s `` the turnaround decade,'' and warns, `` By many measures, time is running out.'' Global warming, because it affects all else, is of the most concern to futurists and to many environmentalists. Scientists agree that human action, principally burning fossil fuels and the slash-and-burn clearing of vast forest lands, is increasing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In what is called the `` greenhouse effect,'' carbon dioxide and some other gases act like a global thermal blanket, allowing sunlight to strike <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but trapping heat that otherwise would radiate back into space. Eventually, the theory goes, the planet will warm, polar ice will melt, climates will change, oceans will rise, agricultural patterns will be disrupted and food supplies will decline. Scientists disagree about whether the greenhouse effect is already causing the Earth to overheat. But it is accepted that only a determined effort to reduce fossil fuel use and halt destruction of forests will reverse rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Human actions also are thought to be causing the depletion in the stratosphere of the ozone layer that shields against ultraviolet solar radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons, a widely used chemical family, becomes a pollutant in the atmosphere, destroying ozone molecules and weakening the UV shield. This can lead to more skin cancer, weaker plants and poorer harvests. Industry and governments already have recognized this problem and have signed agreements to eventually stop use of chlorofluorocarbons, but atoms of this chemical can survive for 50 years, assuring that ozone depletion will be a problem well beyond the 1990s. Governments also are taking action against other environmental problems _ acid rain, water pollution, garbage disposal and the extinction of species. How well these measures succeed is, again, an issue of the 1990s that will depend on human will. Worldwide economic turbulence is second on the list of impending worries, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> survey. The growing chasm between rich and poor, between debt-ridden, overpopulated Third World nations and the vigorous economies of developed nations may sharply intensify in the new decade. But for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, experts see the ` 90s as an era of prosperity. `` The 1990s will be a decade of solid economic growth ... and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will continue to be the most influential nation in technology, trade and political leadership,'' predict economists <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiplinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiplinger </PERSON> in their book `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the Global'90s.'' The trick, said <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON>, will be in finding ways to allow the poorer nations to share in the good times. Nuclear war, long considered the greatest threat to the world's future, is third on the list of future fears The specialists believe this concern has receded because of the Cold War thaw, but they warn that the missiles, East and West, are still poised, and the road to a sure and certain peace is not in place. Fourth on the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> list of problems for the 1990s: the epidemic of drug abuse in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a concern not even mentioned in earlier surveys by the society. Cocaine and its insidious first cousin, crack, have turned many urban neighborhoods into marketplaces for addiction, with murder a nightly event, and crimes routinely committed to support drug habits. Marijuana is grown illegally in many parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and heroin continues to hook the young. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged a war to shut down the illegal trade, and other nations are battling powerful drug cartels. The results are still uncertain, and the effort is sure to extend into the 1990s, and perhaps beyond. The futurists rank the AIDS epidemic as the fifth-worst problem of the new decade, although some medical experts would put it at the top.

 In a two-year study that used mathematical models to project the course of the plague, the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> warned that acquired immune deficiency syndrome is `` a catastrophe ... sweeping over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The institute, a distinguished think tank, predicts that by the end of the 1990s more than 1.5 million Americans will have died of AIDS and that, unless new tactics are used, up to 14.5 million Americans will be infected with the AIDS virus by 2002. `` Nothing can totally avert this coming catastrophe,'' the study says. `` Medical science can ease the suffering and slow the progression of the disease, but no ` cure' is on the horizon. ... Unchecked, AIDS will kill more Americans in the next decade than have died in combat in all of the nation's wars.'' AIDS has peaked in the homosexual community and is rampant among people who inject drugs, but the study forecast that in the 1990s the disease will surge among heterosexuals, becoming an overwhelming plague of the young and poor. The study says that only through a major change in society's sexual patterns is there hope of reducing the toll of AIDS, which is caused by a virus spread mostly through sexual intercourse Thus, AIDS, as with many other problems of the 1990s, can be controlled by human will. Despite the litany of concerns for the new decade, the 1990s also offer great promise. In medicine, scientists are beginning to crack the genetic code and learn how to change the fundamental blueprint of life. Plant genes are being manipulated to improve yield and fight insects and disease, promising more food untainted by pesticides in the new decade. The complex human genome _ the complete set of genes _ also is being mapped, and scientists are already finding specific genes that cause or facilitate disease. Eventually, though probably beyond the 1990s, medicine hopes to replace the defective genes of illness with the normal genes of health. Improved techniques and new drugs even now in testing will enable doctors in the 1990s to transplant virtually any organ and to even more vigorously combat heart disease and cancer, ancient killers already in retreat. A revolution in materials science is under way and is sure to accelerate into the 1990s. Lightweight but strong plastics and ceramics are replacing metals in airplanes, cars and construction. Superconducters, composites that can carry electricity without resistance, are being developed at laboratories worldwide, offering the promise of more efficient power transmission, faster computers and high-speed rail transport. In electronics, a new wave of scientists matured in the generation of the silicon chip will apply their expertise to an already flourishing field. They'll find new uses for the smart chip, integrating it even more thoroughly into household gadgets, automobiles and educational tools. Some experts predict that personal computers will perform hundreds of new jobs and become as essential to the home of the 1990s as the telephone. Supercomputers are being teamed with new mathematics to allow scientists to model even the most complex and random events. This may hold the key to a fundamental understanding of the weather, of earthquakes and of economic trends. How does smoke from a stack in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> affect the weather in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>? What does a change in ocean currents near <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> mean to wheat harvests in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>? The improved science of math modeling may yield answers in the 1990s. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s decade in space centers on construction of space station Freedom, an orbiting laboratory that will give astronauts a permanent place to experiment in weightlessness and to test systems for a prospective voyage to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> in the next century. Building the station still is an uncertainty, depending on the determination of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the 1990s will still witness American space spectaculars. Two space probes, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, are already on their way to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Jupiter, carrying new, more sophisticated instruments to explore those distant worlds. In 1992, another probe will be sent to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The Hubble telescope, to be launched next year, will be able to study star galaxies 14 billion light years away, looking farther back in time than ever before was possible. Wise use of promising technologies can help overcome many of the obvious problems of the 1990s, but <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON> said an international effort, as never before, will be necessary. `` There are solutions for any of the problems, but not quick, simple and easy solutions,'' he said. `` They require international cooperation and we do n't know yet how to get international cooperation. `` We -LRB- human beings -RRB- are getting better at it,'' he added. `` And I think there are good reasons for optimism for the future.'' But that future, he said, may well turn, like a jeweled hinge, on decisions made in the decade of the 1990s.

<HEAD>1990 Hyundai Sonata GLS: Surprising Room, Performance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Forget what you know about Hyundais. Just get inside the carmaker's 1990 Sonata. Otherwise, you'll spend 5 minutes walking around this roomy, mid-size car, convinced someone stuck the wrong nameplate on the door. The test car, a <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> Sonata GLS with leather interior and V-6 engine, showed the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> carmaker has considerable talents beyond the little low-end subcompact Excel it has been selling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1986. The Sonata felt big inside and acted big, with a 3-liter, multi-port, fuel-injected six-cylinder engine teamed with four-speed automatic overdrive transmission that delivered up to 142 horsepower on demand rather smoothly. I even made the tires squeal a few times when I really tried to gun it. Front seats were roomy, and back seat space was impressive. With the front seats moved up a bit, I could even stretch out my legs in the back seat. With the front seats back a bit, I still had decent legroom. Headroom and shoulder space in back also were commendable. In fact, the Sonata's 99.7 cubic feet of passenger space is bigger than that of some other sedans such as the Toyota Camry. Exterior styling on the Sonata was subdued, not exactly expressive, but certainly the car has a nice look. Suspension and handling is capable. The car does a good job of cushioning harsh bumps with its rather spongy ride. Inside, the rear-seat armrests offered storage space, big side windows added to the roomy feel and the ventilation system was powerful. The button to pop open the trunk was neatly tucked on the underside of the driver's armrest, so you do n't have to hunt for it in the glovebox as in some domestic cars. Best of all, the base price for a 1990 Sonata with manual transmission is $ 9,999, making it a potent price competitor in the mid-size sedan segment. In contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> Galant sedan with manual transmission starts at $ 10,989 and the Toyota Camry sedan with manual transmission starts at $ 11,588. At that <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> price, you're close to the upscale Sonata GLS with manual transmission, which starts at $ 12,349. And the GLS model includes tilt steering, cruise control, power door locks and windows and illuminated vanity mirror as standard equipment. The GLS test car, with options that included leather interior, air conditioning and premium radio, topped out at $ 15,849. Not bad for a roomy, V-6-powered car that can comfortably and sensibly be used for family jaunts around town, vacation travel or trips to work. That should appeal to likely buyers of the Sonata, most of whom will be men -LRB- 55 percent of buyers -RRB-, with a median age of 40, and married -LRB- 70 percent of buyers -RRB-, according to the company. Thirty-three percent of buyers are likely to be college-educated and median income is expected to be $ 32,000. I did find a couple of annoyances in the test car. The power antenna made five or six loud, thumping sounds whenever it went up or down. And, as a passenger pointed out, the open-close adjustments for the inside vents at each end of the dashboard did n't work properly; the vents actually released more air when the levers were in the closed position. But overall, the Sonata was a surprising car. Unfortunately, sales have been surprising, too _ surprisingly low since the Sonata's introduction early in 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> had looked to sell 80,000 of the cars this year. But sales totaled 26,150 through October as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car sales turned sluggish. Because the Sonata is a new vehicle, there is no owner report of trouble from Consumer Reports magazine.

<HEAD>The Artists: The Passion of Georgia O'Keeffe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Passion and commitment to her art drove <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s painting, which both illuminates her appeal and adds a compassionate dimension to the O'Keeffe legend, according to a recent biographer. <PERSON> Roxana </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, author of `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> O'Keeffe: A Life,'' said the artist endures because she painted emotion in the 20th century. `` From the start of this century, painting in this country has been done in the masculine tradition, -LRB- which -RRB- has been either cold or angry. <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s paintings are passionate, tender and full of joy. And specifically they refer to the female experience,'' she said in a recent interview. The findings by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, aided in her study by cooperation from <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s family, come in contrast to popular notions that <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> was detached, even cool about her work and relationships. She draws from <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s letters and interviews with her associates and relatives to trace the artist's life from childhood on the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> prairie in the early 1900s through her tumultuous marriage to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> photographer and art impresario <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> O'Keeffe: A Life'' -LRB- <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> and Row, $ 25 -RRB- also examines <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s complicated relationship with <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a 23-year-old drifter who appeared on her doorstep looking for work in 1973 and stayed until her death. The letters discount the persistent sexual interpretations of <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s work. `` She was much warmer and more vulnerable than I expected,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a novelist and art historian. `` She was also probably colder and more difficult, too. But doing the research I began to understand why.'' <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s life on the prairie as the eldest daughter of a farming family with six siblings taught her the importance of self-sufficiency; her independence was established early in life. `` I am going to live a different life from the rest of you girls,'' she said upon graduating from high school. `` I am going to give up everything for my art.'' Her love for <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON>, who was nearly two decades her senior, was strong, and he not only was enamored with her, but as a leading figure in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s art world he was also her greatest booster. `` If you were a woman and a painter, you were a woman painter. And that was very different from being a painter,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` It was important that she had somebody that was at least trying to get her work perceived as equal to men. But he did n't promote her work as any better than it actually was.'' <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON>, however, was also <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s greatest source of pain, but she never confronted him with his appetite for other young women. Again, her family ethic of self-sufficiency allowed her to cope. She demanded her solitude to work and began to spend about half the year apart from her husband, painting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The O'Keeffe legend portrays her as a woman who just decided she was leaving one morning, but <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s pain was deep. `` At that period of her deepest grief and unhappiness she turned her energies toward her art instead of her anguish,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON> chose to make her unhappy, her job was to see that she was not unhappy. It was not to change his behavior.'' <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> died in 1986 at the age of 98. The research alone makes <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s book worth reading, although her prose is sometimes redundant and her own pronouncements on feminism often blunt the message <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s life so clearly illustrated. The book does not raise the issue of <ORGANIZATION> O'Keeffe </ORGANIZATION>'s supposed bisexuality because, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, she could not produce any corroborating evidence. The sexual content of much of <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s bright and flowing flowers has long been debated, most vehemently by the artist herself. `` When you took time to really notice my flower, you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower,'' <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> wrote to one critic. `` And you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower _ and I do n't.'' For <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>, the flowers were demonstrations of passion, but not specifically representing genitalia or sexual objects, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> says. `` O'Keeffe's flowers were images drawn from a female perspective, which made them both new and suspect,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> wrote. Similarly, <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>'s later stark depictions of cattle skulls and bones she found on the desert of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> were often misinterpreted to symbolize death. `` I have wanted to paint the desert and I have n't known how,'' she wrote in an exhibition catalog. `` So I brought home the bleached bones as my symbols of the desert. To me they are as beautiful as anything I know. ... The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive in the desert even tho' it is vast and empty and untouchable _ and knows no kindness with all its beauty.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> portays <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON> as a leading example of the changing roles of women throughout the 20th century. `` <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>, by her example, gave permission to the following generations of women to give work priority in their lives, to consider it crucial,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> writes. `` Her paintings ... were about something that had never been before so clearly revealed: the female experience.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Burning Down the House With a New Latin Beat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forsaking African rhythms, jazz arrangements and avant-garde electronics of previous Talking Heads and solo efforts, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s latest musical safari has brought him to the seductive beats of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's a little different, maybe,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said from the stage of the Pantages theater to the bobbing concertgoers below. `` But maybe not,'' he quickly added, springing into another conga-laced tune. Those familiar with the hybrid tastes of <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, the lead singer of Talking Heads, knew just what he meant. Although his new album, `` <PERSON> Rei </PERSON> <PERSON> Momo </PERSON>,'' is infused with merengues and sambas, it's about as traditional a record as any he's made. `` I'm not trying to convert people, or educate people or do any of that kind of stuff,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said in an interview while stopping in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> during a national tour this fall. `` For me, it's purely something I'm getting a lot of enjoyment out of _ music that I think is deep and fun It's what I want to do. It's not as though I'm saying: ` Now, I want to tell you about this! You must sit down and listen!''' Unlike the contemplative, occasionally downcast themes cascading through <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s prior work, `` Rei Momo'' carries both invigorating lyrics and beats. In `` Do n't Want to Be Part of Your World,'' for example, he sings of children escaping an imperfect life to a place `` free from greed and hunger, free from hate and war.'' `` I think it is somewhat inherent in the culture _ the music, the melodies and rhythms _ that it can give you a kind of tinge of something uplifting, spiritual or whatever,'' the 37-year-old <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, there's a vast difference between the rich and the poor. The economy is in pretty bad shape. And yet they have these incredible cultural resources. The spirit of the people is very rich. `` Not only in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> but also in a lot of Latin culture, in the barrios in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ... music is filled with the spirit of life. And you feel, ` This is what is allowing people to go on.' `` The music seems to reflect their lives and add something to their lives, rather than being the latest record that's foisted on them.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> is the latest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> artist to use Latin sounds in pop music in the 1980s. Others have included <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has worked with Brazilian star <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Transfer. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> recorded a song, `` La <LOCATION> Isla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION>,'' which had a Latin flavor, and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> put out an album of Mexican favorites taught to her by her father. Twenty-five years after Brazilian music first caught American ears with the quiet strains of bossa nova, a second Brazilian invasion is occurring. Brazilian superstars such as <PERSON> Djavan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Veloso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> have been signed to American labels and are touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Latin music has likewise grown in popularity, with the arrival of crossover artists such as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine and <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Blades </PERSON>. The co-founder of the 14-year-old but now idle Talking Heads, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> has directed the film `` True Stories,'' acted in public television's `` Trying Times,'' and composed the scores for the <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> dance `` The <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s opera `` The Forest'' and the movies `` The Last Emperor'' and `` Married to the Mob.'' For the 1986 movie `` Something Wild,'' he composed his first Afro-Latin single, `` Loco de Amor,'' sung by <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, the queen of Latin music. It was scarcely a radical departure. In some of the 10 albums <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> has recorded with Talking Heads, especially 1980's `` Remain in Light'' and last year's `` Naked,'' his music has been laced with African sounds. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> refined his appreciation for Afro-Latin compositions while spending six weeks in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> last year making a documentary about native dance-music rituals for public television's `` Alive From Off Center.'' In addition to `` <PERSON> Rei </PERSON> <PERSON> Momo </PERSON>,'' he has assembled two compilations of Brazilian hits, `` Beleza Tropical: <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> Classics, Volume 1,'' which reached the No. 1 position on Cashbox's Latin charts, and the new `` O Samba: <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> Classics, Volume 2.'' Because <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> enjoys a loyal following, his current tour is attracting mostly capacity audiences. `` Rei Momo'' debuted at No. 30 on the compact disc charts while the album was No. 109 after two weeks. Yet the people attending the concerts given by <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and his 16-piece band are largely white Americans _ not the kind of audience usually seen at a concert where vocals are n't always in English and the bandstand is filled with such instruments as the coro and sencerro _ <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> drums _ and guiro, a percussion device. `` What we're doing will help the Latin scene ... a lot,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardona </PERSON>, a percussionist who appears on <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s album and tour. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who plays trumpet and arranged several of the album's songs, said: `` That's part of the excitement. To us, it's great to be bringing this music to a bigger audience And I think the public is ready for something new.'' Said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>: `` You do n't have to understand it to enjoy it. `` I'm encouraged by the audience -LRB- but -RRB- I'm still afraid about radio,'' he said. `` When -LRB- radio stations -RRB- hear that it's a Latin record, they say, ` Whoa! We do n't play Latin music, we play the hits.''' For both the album and the 20-city tour that started in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in mid-September with plans for a South American and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> swing, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> gathered some of the nation's leading Latin musicians _ veterans of bands for <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Blades </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> In assembling the record, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> attempted to build songs that satisfied both his perfectionist personality and the music's latent disregard for formality. `` On the cumbia -LRB- ` Independence Day' -RRB-, for instance, I had a drum set up for the recording session,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. `` And the drummer came in, and he hardly ever touched the drums. He usually would play the side of one of the tom toms. He did n't hit the snare drum once. So it was ... everything exactly the opposite of what a rock drummer would do. `` This was really different than recording with Talking Heads. For each song, we'd kind of cast the players in a way. ... If something was, say, a merengue, there are musicians who specialize in that kind of rhythm and those kind of bass parts, and we'd get those musicians in.'' While a few critics have accused the shy musician of international cultural vandalism, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> says he's only creating new music out of old, as has been done for years. `` If everybody plays the same stuff, then nobody will listen to any of it,'' he said. `` I want to be free to do whatever I want to do. ... I get accused a little bit of flirting around with different styles, but I think a lot of them have an awful lot in common, and that I'm not jumping around as much as it may appear on the surface.''

 It's been months since <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> has looked at his novel, `` The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' a nominee for the National Book Award. He remembers love scenes and music, but certain passages have slipped his mind; picking up the book again will be like reading it for the first time. It always works that way. Faces of old friends become blurred over the years. Listen to your favorite song 100 times and a note or turn of phrase will still surprise you. Only the most fanatical <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> fan can anticipate every joke. Memory, music, `` I Love Lucy'' _ they all matter in `` The Mambo Kings Plays Songs of Love'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Farrar </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Giroux </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18.95 -RRB-, in which <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> briefly drops in on the world of brothers <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, and to their astonishment, transports them to the living room of <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> was always one of the essential, successful Cubans,'' said <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON>, the son of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> immigrants. `` He did n't have a down image. When you think about how Latins are portrayed in the media, even today, they're either hoods or they're cops. `` He was a middle-class man, very successful. He had a whacked-out life, but he had a real relationship, a real life, and that image really enchanted me. He also a slight melancholic streak. He had a lot of qualities that I related to.'' Try to remember this `` I Love Lucy'' episode: Two Cuban brothers, old friends of <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>'s, arrive at the apartment one day. They exchange chitchat with the <ORGANIZATION> Ricardos </ORGANIZATION>, and later appear at the <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION>, crooning `` Beautiful Maria of My Soul'' with the bandleader himself joining the brothers on stage. -LRB- <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, naturally, is upset because she wanted to appear in the show instead -RRB-. Sound familiar? Well, it never really happened, but that's the point. `` Mambo Kings'' is a song of invented memory, a mournful melody of events distorted by nostalgia and loss. `` The one thing you do n't lose is memory, and memory nags you,'' <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> said. `` Look at Jewish writers who write about things that have happened, internally things go around and around and around. `` If you're hung up on the past you ca n't move forward. <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> tries to get courage from the American notion of discarding the past and move forward.'' Loss of youth, love and country run through `` <ORGANIZATION> Mambo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>.'' In the late 1940s, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> _ gregarious and ambitious _ and <LOCATION> Nestor </LOCATION> _ moody and romantic _ arrive in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as aspiring mambo musicians. The end comes 30 years later, in a rundown hotel room where <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> drinks himself to death. Women inspire their songs and their songs inspire women. Love affairs for <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> are as intense, and short-lived, as the latest dance craze. For <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON>, heartbreak is timeless, a haunting ballad undiminished by repeated listenings. And memories of home are inescapable for both Castillos. No amount of rum, women and song can replace their simple, easygoing life in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I think most immigrants are basically homesick,'' <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't imagine losing something like your country unless you've really lost it. It's just a dream of something lost, which you can never really retrieve. `` You meet Cubans in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who have made a million bucks, but they will never have what they had before.'' <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> was born in 1951 and grew up on 118th Street on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, a neighborhood remembered in his first novel, `` Our House in the Last World,'' published in 1985. He first wanted to be a musician, but was turned off by the rock' n' roll drug scene and drifted into writing in his mid-20s. <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> nearly quit that as well, finding authors no more appealing than rock stars. `` I went to a writers conference in 1978 and I found it the most sexist, hierarchal, opinionated, prejudical place I've ever been on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. If you do n't write their way, you do n't write. If you're a woman and pretty, you get invited to parties, if not, forget it.'' Meeting author <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON>, who died recently, provided <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> with a valued friend and mentor. `` He sort of took me under his wing and pointed me in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> recalled. `` He was n't narrow-minded in his view of literature and exposed me to a lot of writers. And even though I was writing quite differently from him, he never held that against me.'' `` He was a really nice man and a top-notch editorial adviser.'' <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> helped with `` Mambo Kings,'' and <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> and some not-so-famous musicians provided inspiration. <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> recalled working in a downtown office where the elevator operator would come up to his floor and sing. A Cuban musician who died in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel room made a lasting impression. And, of course, there were songs, hundreds of them. `` Mambo Kings'' is like a greatest hits album, complete with <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON>' favorite dance songs, boleros and ballads <PERSON> Hijuelos </PERSON> urges readers to start where they wish, open at any page, like dropping the needle in the middle of a record, or tuning in `` I Love Lucy'' at intermission and quickly filling in the plot. `` <PERSON> Barthelme </PERSON> was like that. Instead of thinking of a chapter as a chapter, you think of it as an atmosphere, a state of consciousness,'' he said. `` I wrote this book where you can open it up anywhere and get an idea of what's going on in the book.''

<TEXT>
 After a show business career of more than 30 years, including singing in movie classics such as `` Oklahoma!'' and `` The Music Man,'' <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has released her first solo album. The Diadem Music LP `` Silent Strength'' is a collection of gospel songs. `` I grew up singing Christian music,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 55, said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I was the youngest member of my church choir at age 6. `` It has been synonymous with my singing. It's beautiful music and this -LRB- project -RRB- was a wonderful experience. `` I've never really done a solo album. I've done the movie albums and did some things for <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> with my husband, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, and of course ` The Partridge Family.''' In 1970-74, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON> in the popular TV comedy about a family that became successful in show business. She portrayed a widowed suburban mother and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, her real life stepson, was <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON>. `` I did 23 motion pictures and nobody knew me until ` The Partridge Family,''' she said. `` But that's TV. The power of TV is the strongest power we have now. You become a friend to people. You're really not larger than life, but part of their family. `` The show had a combination of things. It had music for the time. We were a family in show business, an everyday family. Plus we had good actors. <PERSON> David </PERSON> was a teen hero and little <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaduce </PERSON> was a wonderful young comedian. The chemistry worked.'' Her movie credits, besides `` Oklahoma!'' and `` The Music Man,'' include `` Carousel,'' `` Elmer Gantry'' -LRB- Academy Award for supporting actress in 1961 -RRB-, `` April Love'' and `` Beyond the Poseidon Adventure.'' Her most recent film was `` Tank'' with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> three years ago. The Oscar, she said, changed her career. `` I was considered a pretty young thing who could sing until then. After that, they said that maybe this kid can act. It opened doors for me, no doubt.'' She also has appeared in several TV movies, including `` The Family Nobody Wanted,'' `` Winner Take All,'' `` The Orchard Children,'' `` Last Cry for Help'' and `` Silent Night, Lonely Night.'' Most dealt with topical issues such as gambling addiction, unjust adoption procedures and teen suicide. `` Those kind of roles are wonderful to play,'' Miss <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. She recently taped a two-hour tribute show to composer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, to be broadcast on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> next March. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> also sings frequently with symphony orchestras across the country. One of her traditional songs is `` You'll Never Walk Alone'' from `` Carousel.'' The song is also on her solo album. `` It conveys a message to audiences of all types, whether Christian or Jewish or whatever,'' she said. `` Those words touch people. I've been singing it even before ` Carousel.' It's been part of my repertoire for 30 years now. When I think of the words during a distressing time, it helps me through.'' Among other cuts on the album, `` The Music's Got ta Stop Someday'' describes the emptiness of entertainment without content. The title cut `` Silent Strength'' is about trusting one's savior. `` We spent five hours in my living room one Sunday afternoon going through the music,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We pored through music and talked about words and what was right for me. I wanted to do beautiful ballads with beautiful lyrics and no rock' n' roll stuff.'' She said she's at a point in her career where she accepts only projects that intrigue her. `` I'm at a marvelous place in my life. I'm not driven by my career, but I never have been really. I can pick and choose. I'm able to do what I want to do which is sing, basically.''

<HEAD>Paramount Plans to Take $140 Million Pre-Tax Charge in 4th Fiscal
Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainment giant that made a failed bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> this past summer, said it plans to take a $ 140 million pre-tax charge on its publishing operations for its recently completed fourth fiscal quarter. Paramount said Tuesday that as a result its publishing operations, which include <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, <ORGANIZATION> Prentice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and Pocket Books, will report a break-even performance for the year ended Oct. 31. The charge reflects a writedown in the value of some publishing assets and accruals for costs associated with improving publishing technology. Despite the charge, the company's overall results are expected to be sharply higher. It previously announced a $ 1.2 billion after-tax gain on the sale of its consumer and commercial finance business and a $ 12 million after-tax gain on the sale of two small Prentice Hall units. Paramount earned $ 384.7 million, or $ 3.21 a share, on revenue of $ 5.1 billion in fiscal 1988. In late trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> was off $ 2.12 -LCB- a share at $ 54. `` The publishing side is not doing as well as I thought it would be in the summer,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who follows Paramount for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But he said it is not unusual for a company to take charges when it is also taking big one-time gains. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said, `` The charge against publishing earnings reflects changes in the marketplace affecting the entire industry, such as sharply rising product development and marketing costs and shorter revision periods for textbooks.'' He said the fundamentals of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s publishing businesses were `` extremely sound'' and should continue to represent an important source of earnings and cash flow. `` We are confident that fiscal 1990 results will show significant improvement and provide a solid base for growth in the decade of the 1990s and beyond,'' he said. Paramount previously announced that it expects to take an $ 80 million charge for the costs of its failed bid for Time. Time rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12 billion takeover offer, bought controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expects to buy the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares later this year Counting both the publishing charge and the charge related to the failed buyout bid, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it expects little change in its earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 1989 rcompared with $ 147.8 million, or $ 1.23 a share, in fiscal 1988.

<HEAD>Grand Marnier Liqueur Plans Motorized Magazine Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The importers of Absolut vodka were nosed out recently by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in getting the first `` talking'' magazine ad to market. But <ORGANIZATION> Carillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> is back, claiming a first for another of its brands _ a `` motorized'' magazine ad for Grand Marnier liqueur. When the center spread of the four-page ad is opened, a cardboard cutout that shows two fanciful birds with oranges on their bodies gently swinging a bottle of Grand Marnier between them as if it were a bell. The cutout is powered by a tiny battery embedded out of sight beneath the cutout. The <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, N.J.-based importer said Tuesday it had spent more than $ 1 million on the four-page holiday ad that is to appear in selected copies of the Dec. 11 issue of the New Yorker. The ad will be included in the 200,000 issues of the magazine that are sent to subscribers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The ad is the latest example of the extra effort some liquor advertisiers take to make their ads stand out at Christmastime. Absolut vodka's talking ad in selected copies of the December issue of Vanity Fair magazine delivered tinny holiday greetings in Italian, English and Spanish. But <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> ran an ad with a talking computer chip about two weeks earlier in Business Week magazine. Other holiday magazine ad spectaculars this year include a hologram from Finlandia vodka, an ad with pull-up tabs from Chivas Regal Scotch whisky and peel-off stickers from Crown Royal Canadian whisky. Some advertising executives have criticized the ad spectaculars, saying it detracts from the environment for their clients' ads. But others argue the unusual ads attract attention to a magazine and make consumers more aware of other magazines. `` Most people love to see this sort of thing in their magazines,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We thought this was innovative and creative and our readers would enjoy seeing it.''

<HEAD>Forest Land Ownership Emerging As Regional Concern</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report and on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For years, few in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> were concerned about who owned the woods. Now preservationists worry the verdant expanse may fall prey to developers catering to their cramped clientele down south. With nearly 26 million acres of forest extending from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Adirondacks, there used to be little worry that hunters, hikers, and fishermen would lose access to the landscape renowned for its deer and bear habitat, sparkling lakes and trout-filled streams But conservationists now are suspicious about the huge corporations trying to take over companies in the region and are wondering what they plan to do with the land. Some fear they might be seduced by the lucrative development of the isolated terrain into vacation home tracts. `` People realized there was a change in the value of the lands,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, one of the authors of a congressionally mandated study on forest preservation. For decades, most forest land transfers involved swaps of acreage from one paper company to another, with both companies valuing the land largely on the basis of timber production, <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> said. Only recently came the realization that development potential could far outstrip the value of the trees. Public awareness of that change came after corporate raider Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> bought <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and liquidated its assets, including 1.7 million acres of timberland, mostly in the Northeast. One of the most spectacular parcels was the Nash Stream valley in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Its sale last year to developers who planned to subdivide it as vacation tracts goaded the state into buying the 45,000 acres for $ 13 million, giving the developers a tidy profit. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> proposed a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 2.1 million acres of timberland in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and is the state's largest landowner. The proposal renewed conservationists' fears of a forest sellout that could spur development and reduce public access. Assurances from <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> that it has historically been a buyer, not a seller, of timberland failed to allay fears it might be forced to sell much of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> acreage to ease its takeover debt. `` While we may not have agreed with the way Great Northern has cut its land and its forest practices, they have shown very little interest in development and were pretty much dedicated to managing the land for timber production,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, policy director of <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` With <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, it's pretty much an unknown, and it's difficult to say what's going to happen _ whether they'll sell out, or decide to develop certain areas or continue in the mold of Great Northern,'' <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said In the meantime, the outcry over <ORGANIZATION> Nash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stream </ORGANIZATION> prompted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 250,000 on the yearlong study of the region's forests to assess ownership patterns, forest managment strategies and public access. The purpose of the study was to develop ways to encourage private owners to keep trees growing on their lands, rather than cash in on its potential value for house lots and vacation retreats. The vast majority of the land is privately owned, most of it by multinational pulp and paper companies that also operate the mills which provide some of the region's best-paying jobs. Over the years, the companies have had few qualms about permitting public recreational use of their lands, although recently some have instituted gate fees to defray the costs of maintaining large networks of private roads. To local residents, public access has long been regarded as a birthright, part of the region's way of life. `` It's a strong feeling among the folks here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, vice president for woodlands for <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Millinocket </LOCATION>. `` It's something that has developed over many generations.'' As the most heavily forested state other than <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> accounts for most of the territory encompassed in the congressional Northern Forest Land Study. Also included are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Adirondacks and <LOCATION> Tug </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> region and small sections of northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> The report, released last month, offers alternative forest preservation strategies, including tax incentives, conservation easements, land-use planning and federal and state acquisition. A series of public forums is being held across the region, and the final report is scheduled to be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in late March or early April.

 As <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> celebrates its 20th anniversary today, its founder pledges to renew a dedication to customers that he believes the fast-food chain lost somewhere along the way. `` We forgot who the customer was,'' founder and former Chairman <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in an interview this week. `` But in 1989, we're working hard on customer satisfaction and clean restaurants. The high school dropout opened the first <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s in downtown <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> on Nov. 15, 1969, naming it after his daughter. He stuck to a limited menu of hamburgers and chili that he believed was the only way to maintain quality. Today, the chain has grown to the nation's third - or fourth-largest, depending upon the criteria used, behind No 1 McDonald's and No. 2 Burger King, and possibly behind <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s. It rakes in $ 3 billion in annual sales with a menu that has mushroomed to include pizza, salad, pasta, two types of chicken sandwiches, burritos, baked potatoes and chocolate chip cookies. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who owns 8 percent, or $ 40 million, of <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s stock, said in a 1978 interview that he wanted <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s to be bigger than <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about that on Monday, he said: `` We still just want to be the best, the cleanest restaurant, the best prices, the best food. We'll be as big as we want to be.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who retired as chairman in 1982, now stars in his own folksy television ads for <ORGANIZATION> Wendy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in nearby <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Industry analysts say <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s started on the fast track and grew quickly, establishing 1,000 stores in nine years and becoming the No. 3 fast-food chain before its recent slide. `` They developed a unique niche targeting the adult fast-food segment of the hamburger industry with a tightly-focused menu,'' said analyst <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` But <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s seems to have lost some of its focus as it tried to expand its menu and diversify into breakfast, which was not successful, and spent a lot of money upgrading its restaurants,'' he said. `` They've seen their market share erode along the way.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the diversification was necessary. `` In 1979, we had a real problem with beef, and the price went way up, and the word ` nutrition' started appearing, so we put in the salad bar. Competition was getting keener, so we added a lot of things. I do n't think we could have the same menu as we did in'69 and be successful,'' he said. Average sales at <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s 3,762 restaurants rose 2.4 percent to $ 759,000 per store last year, breaking a three-year decline. <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported average sales of $ 920,000 at its 3,200 stores last year. Per-unit sales at <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s were highest in 1984, at $ 871,000. That was the year of <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Peller </PERSON>'s commanding performance in the `` Where's the Beef?'' commercials. `` Advertising is an important part of the business, but it's not a cure-all,'' said analyst <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It may raise levels of awareness and bring customers in. But unless you're giving a hot hamburger to a customer in a clean place and quickly, all the advertising in the world is n't going to amount to a hill of beans,'' he said. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> pegged <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s share of the fast-food market at about 4.8 percent, trailing 5.5 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> has about 18.9 percent, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. To help boost sales, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s last November started installing a system allowing customers to pay for food with a Visa card. Tests show people spend more when they use credit cards, the company said. Earnings for the third quarter totaled $ 8.7 million, or 9 cents a share, on revenue of $ 296.2 million, compared with the same profit on revenue of $ 275.2 million for the same period last year. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that, for now, the company will continue a strategy of making existing stores more profitable and opening new units at a slower pace _ about 100 a year. `` We've got to take business from competition, business from anyone,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We've got to take care of the customers, just like we did 20 years ago.''

<HEAD>Southland Says It Could Miss Debt Payments, May Restructure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Disappointing sales and earnings growth is threatening to put <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in violation of its credit agreements, forcing the parent of the 7-Eleven chain to consider a restructuring less than two years after a $ 4.9 billion leveraged buyout. The Dallas-based company said Tuesday that current projections indicate it will not be able to meet its debt payment obligations in 1991, despite better-than-industry-average increases in average store sales. Financial analysts for months have been expressing concern that <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> faced problems with its huge debt, although the company until now maintained it could meet its obligations. But <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> said sales projections at its 7-Eleven convenience store chain, the nation's largest, had not been met. Although President <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> would meet its $ 225 million principal payment due next month, `` given the convenience retailing environment, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> believes its working capital may not be sufficient in 1991 to meet its principal and interest obligations and other requirements of the business.'' `` We are absolutely committed to improving our operating results,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a member of the founding family that bought the company to avoid corporate raider <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON>. `` In addition, we feel it is only prudent to consider financial restructuring alternatives well in advance of the time this cash shortfall could occur.'' He said one alternative might be a comprehensive recapitalization. In a recapitalization, a company alters its levels of debt and equity. The company has been selling assets since the leveraged buyout to help pay off its debt, and announced Tuesday an agreement to sell its 58 Hawaiian stores to <ORGANIZATION> Seven-Eleven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 75 million cash The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to sell its remaining 50 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s state-owned oil company for $ 675 million The sale should be completed by the end of January, the company said. Proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce the LBO debt, the company said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the company also continues to explore selling other assets, including its five distribution centers and six food processing centers. `` The last public projections we had were October 1988, and the operating numbers that we were projecting have not materialized,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Markeeta </PERSON> <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON>. `` Our sales and margins are still extremely good, but they have not met our own projections.'' The company projected inflation-adjusted sales growth of 2 percent. However Ms. <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON> said, inflation had been higher than anticipated and real growth amounted to only less than 1 percent during the first nine months of this year. `` The summer was disappointing for the entire convenience store industry. It was a cold, wet summer for most of the country, especially our major markets,'' Ms. <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON> said. Despite the softness and competition from convenience stores operated by oil companies, Ms. <PERSON> McNatt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION>'s average store sales are continuing at 1988's strong levels, when they increased 4.6 percent, compared with an industry average of a 2.1 percent decline. Also Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> reported a third-quarter loss of $ 63.37 million, compared with $ 46.8 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose to $ 2.23 billion from $ 2.18 billion. For the first nine months of this year, it lost $ 243.76 million, compared with a loss of $ 179.2 million in the year-earlier period. The loss this year included a $ 56 million charge from exchange of debt. Nine-month revenue rose to $ 6.29 billion from $ 6.02 billion.

 The sales slump in domestically made cars and light trucks continued in early November, prompting speculation that automakers will bring back incentives to attract buyers. `` The hard thing to read is which of the Big Three is going to move quickly next to reinvigorate sales with new incentive programs,'' analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday after sales figures were released. The eight major automakers with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants said they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 26,194 during the Nov. 1-10 period compared with a 32,833-a-day pace during the same time last year. Car sales dropped 23.1 percent, while sales of light trucks fell 15.3 percent during the period, compared with early November last year. In October, domestic car and truck sales tumbled 11.6 percent from the rate of October 1988. The drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck sales last month pushed down October retail sales by 1 percent, the first decline in eight months. `` We are in the midst of an automotive recession,'' said analyst <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` For anybody in this economy, these types of numbers today are not funny. `` It's scary,'' he said. `` I do n't think they are going to continue. I hope they wo n't continue.'' One of the ways automakers have accelerated auto sales recently is through cash rebates or cut-rate financing. The companies had incentive programs on a wide variety of 1989 models but have less extensive programs now. <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said that could change. `` Any one of them -LRB- the Big Three -RRB- has a good reason to increase them,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> said he expected bigger incentive packages to be combined with production cuts, a move analysts have been expecting for months. `` You need more than just incentives to get inventories in line,'' he said. `` This is an old-fashioned cyclical downturn with a very sad effect on the general economy.'' Sluggish car and light-truck sales during October and early November have pushed the year-to-date sales rate down 2.6 percent compared with the same time last year. Car sales are down 3.6 percent and truck sales are off 0.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its early November combined domestic car and truck sales were down 26.3 percent compared with last year, with car sales dropping 29.1 percent and truck sales falling 20.9 percent. Sales of vehicles made in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were off 19.9 percent in early November, as car sales fell 23.5 percent and truck sales dropped 14.3 percent. At <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, car sales during the period were down 22.5 percent and truck sales were down 9.9 percent, combining for a 16.6 percent drop in the early November vehicle sales pace.

<HEAD>Stock Market Reform Bill Clears First Hurdle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill giving the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> limited authority to control program trading in market emergencies has cleared its first hurdle. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee, after a sometimes heated debate over whether it was too much too soon, voted Tuesday to send the bill to the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for consideration, possibly as soon as Thursday. Congressional leaders have said they want to end the current session before Thanksgiving. `` I'm not convinced it's something we should have such a rush to judgment,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` We all know we're not going to get this through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and down to the White House before the end of the year anyway,'' he added. But Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said `` I think it would be unconscionable to leave this congressional session without sending a message to the markets. The bill, known as the Securities Markets Stabilization Act of 1989, would give the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> new authority to suspend or constrain practices that could cause market volatility _ sharp price rises and drops. Chief among those controversial practices is program trading, the almost instantaneous, computer-driven transactions involving huge blocks of stock. The proposed legislation also: _ Would give the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority, after consulting with the president, to halt all trading in the securities markets in the event of an emergency like the 1987 stock market crash _ Require large securities transactions to be reported _ Require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and investment firms to verify their financial stability with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Another provision that calls for coordinated clearing and settlement of transactions among the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and other government agencies was moved into a separate bill, the Coordinated Clearance and Settlement Act, which also passed the subcommittee. A similar bill is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders have expressed doubts that they can add a program trading provision and still get it passed before the holiday break. The provision giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> modified authority to halt program trading was approved only after the panel agreed to an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, limiting the description of practices the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> could halt or prohibit. `` This language does not ban program trading and it does not direct the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to ban program trading,'' said <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>. `` It allows the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to use its discretion in limiting or curtailing disruptive trading strategies.'' Opponents of program trading are particularly critical of one form, index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other. Critics claim index arbitrage leads to wild price swings which drives small investors out of the market. And that makes it harder for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to raise capital through the sale of securities, they claim. Originally, the bill sought to prohibit `` manipulative, abusive or disruptive practices'' but several panel members complained that language was too vague. When Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, offered his assurance that he would hammer out suitable compromise language before the bill went to the full committee, Rep. W.J <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., said, `` What I do n't think what we ought to do is move on language we ca n't agree upon. Other members complained that they needed more time to review the most recent changes in the bill, some of which were added just the night before. `` In the waning days of the session,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Manton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, `` I think we're moving rather fast.'' That sparked an outburst from <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>: `` We have had hearing after hearing after hearing,'' he said, noting that several big Wall Street securities firms that oppose program trading were repeatedly invited to testify at those hearings but `` they turned us down every time.'' <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>'s amendment deleted the word `` disruptive'' from the bill, which seemed to satisfy opponents pending further negotiations on appropriate language.

<HEAD>Senate Extends Tax Breaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Senate has voted to extend through June 30 a dozen targeted tax breaks that are expiring, including employer-financed education assistance. The extensions, most of them for six months, were approved by voice vote Tuesday without debate and added to a bill authorizing aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. That measure is subject to further consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Each of the extensions had been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as part of other legislation. Among the extended provisions are those offering tax reductions for up to $ 5,250 per year of employer-paid education aid received by a worker; a limited amount of employer-financed group legal aid; businesses that increase spending for research and experimentation; investment in rental housing for low-income families; self-employed people to help cover the cost of health insurance; employers who hire low-income people, and investors in bonds targeted to help lower-income families buy a first home. Most of the tax breaks are due to expire Dec. 31. The deduction for employer-financed education assistance expired last Dec. 31. The amendment adding the provisions to the Poland-Hungary bill was written by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. `` If we allow them to expire, real damage can be caused,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. He cited, for example, the low-income housing credit as about the only federal aid now available for that sector. `` If we decide it is just going to go away for however long it takes until we can re-enact it, there can be some real damage to low-income housing,'' he said. The cost of the extensions, an estimated $ 1.2 billion, would be made up by accelerating the rate at which large corporations must turn over to the government the taxes they withhold from workers' paychecks

 Thousands of mostly elderly victims lost their savings through <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> after federal thrift regulators undercut a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> case against its owner, say witnesses before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. Four of the victims, some in tears, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday how <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> officials led them to believe junk bonds in the thrift's holding company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, purchased with their converted savings were federally insured and safe. All of them blamed American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and five senators they tagged the `` Keating Five'' who accepted a total of $ 1.3 million in political contributions from the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire. `` Up against the likes of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and the influence he was able to buy from elected officials and others in high office, we did n't stand a chance,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON>, a partially blind widow from <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who lost $ 30,000. The five senators _ <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> _ are subjects of inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Officials are investigating whether the senators improperly intervened on behalf of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> in April 1987 with thrift regulators who were considering seizing <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on grounds it was unsound. Despite a formal recommendation a month later recommending just that, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> waited until April 1989 to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. All of the senators have denied any wrongdoing in the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> fiasco, which is expected to cost taxpayers up to $ 2.5 billion and 22,000 bondholders like Mrs. <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON>, a majority of them retirees, another $ 250 million. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, who as a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> designed the $ 200 billion-plus taxpayer bailout of the S & amp; L industry, said the experiences of Mrs. <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON> and others has convinced him the banking laws need to be rewritten again. `` To be allowed to sell junk bonds of your parent -LRB- company -RRB- in the lobby of a financial institution with the sinecure of federal protection is something that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> perhaps ought to prohibit,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said. `` It's a little bit like having the requirement you ca n't sell liquor within so many yards of a polling place.'' While Mrs. <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON> and the others were being encouraged by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> officials to move their money out of federally insured deposits into the high-risk, uninsured bonds, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was trying to determine if the holding company had filed false financial statements. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said a May 20, 1988, `` memorandum of understanding'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> accepting the thrift's accounting on $ 135 million in disputed transactions gave the parent company a powerful legal tool to resist the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s probe. `` The regulator of the subsidiary institution said, in essence, that financial statements were all right,'' he said. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, now called the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, said the memorandum `` in no way could have impeded'' the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` They're independent. ... There's nothing we can do to get in the way,'' he said. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has turned over some of the evidence in its probe to a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> considering possible criminal charges against <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his associates. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the bank board's chairman and now head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, have been subpoenaed to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee next week. While the committee has focused on Wall, the victims directed much of their anger at <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, who raised more than $ 970 million from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for his own and other Democratic political causes. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickman </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>., <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said she and her husband were heartbroken when they learned their $ 25,000 in retirement funds had been lost `` I had no idea this man could be so corrupted,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON>. `` What <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> did here was not only foolish; it was cruel, it was dishonest. It has devastated people and it has devastated me.'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flander </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, said the senator has `` nothing but compassion for these people.'' Among other <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> developments Tuesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he intends to investigate other failed thrifts `` beyond <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' including <ORGANIZATION> Silverado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, on whose board <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son, once served _ <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, acknowledged through a spokeswoman that in March 1987 he visited a lavish resort <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was building in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> funds to give a speech to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> employees _ <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an appointee of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, had called the agency's top enforcement official as a character witness for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> A former top <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official testified last week that Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had approached her about obtaining for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> an early examination audit of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> by regional thrift regulators.

 Every time the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s stars butt heads on network television, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimmons </PERSON> says, her company is being thrown for a loss. She is president of <ORGANIZATION> Schutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had supplied 40 percent of the helmets used by <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> players until this year, when the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION>'s licensing arm signed an agreement with her prime competitor, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Riddell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON> is making helmets, shoulder pads and other gear available to the league's 28 teams for free if 90 percent of a team's players use its helmets. Players who wear helmets by other companies must conceal those companies' logos. That agreement has landed the two companies in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>, where lawyers for <PERSON> Schutt </PERSON> argued at a trial in September that <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON> has violated federal antitrust laws. A decision is pending. `` Other people want to emulate their heroes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nimmons </PERSON> said. `` They will use what their heroes use.'' She said her central Illinois-based company could be forced out of business by the agreement, which she says hurts its sales of helmets to college and high school football teams. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON>, said football helmets are n't `` impulse'' items that coaches or equipment managers would buy after glimpsing the helmets during televised <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> games. `` No one has ever tried to advertise football helmets on TV like you would dishwashing detergent or bubble gum, because no one is interested in that sort of thing,'' <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> said. `` You would no more advertise a football helmet than you would a B-1 bomber.'' No money is involved in the Riddell-NFL deal. <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON> is gaining exposure that might help the company launch a line of running shoes and sportswear, <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nimmons </PERSON> contends that exposure is worth $ 750,000 a game or $ 12 million a season _ the amount her company would have to pay for television advertising during <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> games to match <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON>'s air time. That is more than her company's annual gross receipts from helmet sales, she said. <PERSON> Schutt </PERSON>, the nation's second-largest manufacturer of football helmets, is privately held and Mrs. <PERSON> Nimmons </PERSON> declined to provide an exact sales figure. Fortune magazine estimated <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON>'s annual sales at $ 20 million for 1988. <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON> officials did not return repeated phone calls. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the league's licensing rights, said the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> hooked up with <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON> because the company has been a licensee of <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> Properties for years. A licensee has the right to market helmets with clubs' names on them. `` <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON> has always provided good service to the clubs, and it's not much of a change in the status quo,'' he said. In the last 10 years, the number of major football helmet companies has dropped from 18 to three because of lawsuits over helmet safety, Mrs. <PERSON> Nimmons </PERSON> said. The other major manufacturer is <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That trend has helped drive helmet prices higher, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> `` A coach is probably paying $ 120 for a helmet that, taking away the insurance and given a competitive situation, would probably cost a fraction of that,'' <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> said. Deals like <PERSON> Riddell </PERSON>'s will only push the price higher, Mrs. <PERSON> Nimmons </PERSON> said. `` The cost of providing all those free goods will be borne by the consumer,'' she said. `` All of a sudden the poor guy is paying for the rich guy to get free stuff.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up its defense against an unwanted takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have no interest in anything but staying independent at this stage,'' Great Northern Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday, after meeting earlier for 45 minutes with state Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>. `` What we have asked him to do is look to our record and see how we have handled our resources in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> ... to weigh it in his consideration about how he would proceed in court,'' <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 3.13 billion to take over <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 2.1 million acres of forest lands in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Part of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s merger strategy involves an attack on <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law. On Tuesday, Great Northern responded in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> to lawsuits by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> challenging the anti-takeover law and the company's by-laws containing so-called `` poison pill'' provisions to thwart hostile suitors. Great Northern, a major producer of pulp and paper, is incorporated in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, although its headquarters are in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said Tuesday that he does not want to take sides in the merger dispute, but rather hopes to ensure the best deal possible for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s mill employees and the environment `` I feel that the current management of this company is committed to our state and making sure <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> will be an integral part of their operations,'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> has also attempted to persuade <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> officials that its buyout plans would be good for the state. In a letter to Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called the deal `` the old-fashioned kind of transaction that benefits everyone,'' but he stopped short of offering any guarantees about what <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> will do if it wins the merger fight. Environmentalists have raised concerns that <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> might try to sell off valuable recreation lands to developers to pay for its acquisition. The governor's office on Tuesday released a copy of <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s letter, which says, `` If special circumstance arise such that land had to be sold for unforeseen reasons, I assure you that -LRB- the -RRB- Land for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would be given the right of first refusal on such sales for two years. In its court response Great Northern disputed allegations that the anti-takeover provisions of its by-laws were designed to entrench management at shareholder expense, saying it was ironic that <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> itself has a shareholder rights plan and supermajority voting rules similar to the ones it is challenging in court. Great Northern also said Tuesday it had filed a petition with the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> challenging an exemption granted last week to <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so it could take over <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s railroads as part of a buyout attempt. `` They cut corners in an attempt to circumvent the commission's jurisdiction,'' <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said in a statement `` This is simply another example of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s use of questionable tactics to further their own ends. Great Northern attorney <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> got the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approval by eliminating _ on paper _ a trucking franchise that could have blocked the railroad acquisition, then getting its exemption a day later. The company kept its trucking fleet and can still use the trucks for transporting its own materials, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement defending the company's tactics and said there was no merit to Great Northern's <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> filing

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> will buy up to 260 new jets from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a transaction valued at more than $ 10 billion, the carrier announced. The planned purchases of MD-90s and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300s over the next 11 years is in addition to $ 13 billion in orders announced previously. Delta now has 519 new jets on order as part of its drive to expand service and replace older aircraft. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> ordered 50 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 120-passenger 737-300 jets and took options for 50 more. The first planes arrive in 1993. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> ordered 50 of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s new 150-seat MD-90 jets and took options to buy 110 more. But 60 of those options were originally placed last year for MD-88 aircraft and converted Tuesday to MD-90 options, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said. Deliveries begin in 1994. A year ago <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> ordered $ 10 billion worth of mostly international-range jets for expansion in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In all, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> now has 182 orders and 337 options for new jets worth $ 23 billion. `` Delta is putting a lot of financial effort into keeping a modern, efficient fleet as we continue to grow,'' Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> expects to expand capacity by 5 percent to 7 percent per year over the next decade. Delta has the youngest fleet of any major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier, and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the airline hopes to maintain an average aircraft age of about 8 years by retiring older DC-9s, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s and 737s. `` This will give <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> the ability to go either into a heavy fleet replacement program or, depending on the market, a heavy growth plan,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> expects to pay for the new planes primarily with operating revenues He said the airline, which earned a record $ 460.9 million last fiscal year, is committed to keeping its debt low. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the purchases wo n't mean fare increases because a modern fleet saves money in the long run. `` I do n't think our fare increases will exceed the consumer price index in coming years,'' he said. The MD-90s have a list price of $ 40 million each, while 737-300s cost about $ 29 million each. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> declined to say how much of a discount <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> will get. He also would n't say how much of a down payment <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> must make. The MD-90 is an updated version of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION>'s popular MD-80 series jet. It is five feet longer than the MD-88, with eight more seats, and has quieter, more fuel-efficient engines. Delta is the first to order an MD-90. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the 737-300s will have 120 seats _ eight fewer than the 13 737-300s <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> already has. With fewer seats, there will be more leg room and bigger galleys and closets.

<HEAD>``Sustained Effort'' Seen in Slog Toward Superconductivity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TSUKUBA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leading researchers into superconductivity said Wednesday some progress was coming faster than expected but many problems remain in a scientific field that may revolutionize the use of electricity. About 700 scientists, including some 70 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, are in <LOCATION> Tsukuba </LOCATION>, a university town outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, for three days of lectures, papers and discussions on the latest research into superconductivity, which has obsessed thousands of scientists since a breakthrough in 1986. `` I think the development goes faster than I thought,'' said <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Prize for the 1986 breakthrough at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Superconductors are materials that carry electricity without any loss of energy from resistance. The phenomenon was first seen at extremely low temperatures, but since 1986 scientists have developed a series of materials that work at somewhat higher temperatures, raising the possibility that the phenomenon will occur at temperatures that do n't require baths of liquid nitrogen. Superconductivity could make the use of electricity much more efficient, reducing the need to burn so much fossil fuel and opening the way for magnetically levitated high-speed trains, electric cars, better batteries, small supercomputers and many other uses. Competition among scientists is intense, and cries of alarm have been raised in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is investing more heavily in research and thus may make key commercial breakthroughs. `` There are many of the same parallel activities going on in the two countries,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sleight </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a featured speaker in the symposium's first session, told a news conference. `` The effort is somewhat better organized in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but there is progress in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` People have many of the same objectives and are ... working toward those objectives.'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said the European attitude is to remember that it took 20 years to develop a practical transistor. `` The important thing is to have sustained effort,'' he said.

 An insurance company has reimbursed the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> $ 2 million of the largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper, leaving the paper's publishing company to absorb $ 270,000 of the judgment. `` I can tell you that it's a load off my back,'' <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> told the newspaper staff. The newspaper reported today that <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> received the $ 2 million Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Firemen's <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. National Surety agreed to pay the amount in a settlement approved Tuesday PG Publishing had sued <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> in May after the company refused to pay the libel claim under the newspaper's excess-liability policy National Surety argued that state law prohibits an insurer from paying punitive damages, which are intended to punish and to serve as a deterrent. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DiSalle </PERSON>, a former judge, had sued the newspaper over a 1979 article about a disputed will he handled as a lawyer. The jury awarded DiSalle $ 200,000 in actual damages and $ 2 million in punitive damages. The award came to $ 2.77 million with the addition of $ 561,000 in interest. The newspaper paid DiSalle in July after its primary insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, agreed to pay the $ 1 million limit of its coverage Half that amount went to <PERSON> DiSalle </PERSON> and the rest covered attorneys' fees. Even with insurance covering the bulk of the libel award, the newspaper will suffer economically, <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. A hiring freeze and other cost-saving measures implemented in response to the award will remain in effect until at least the end of the year, Business Manager <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. `` We will look at 1990 as a year when we get back to full staffing,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> said the judgment was the largest paid by a newspaper and the second-largest libel judgment upheld by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. The largest was a $ 3 million award last year against <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to review the DiSalle libel award last June. National Surety attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Luddy </PERSON> said the settlement was not an admission that the company's position on punitive damages was incorrect. `` Some of these cases are better settled than litigated. This happened to be one of them,'' he said. `` Our position has n't changed.

 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel today called for stronger measures to protect private pension fund assets so workers do not lose their retirement savings to fraud and mismanagement. `` We must develop greater safeguards to adequately protect the nation's private pension fund assets,'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said as he opened a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on retirement income and employment. `` Our workers and retirees have a right to expect that the pensions they have worked so hard to earn, and which they are counting on to meet basic living expenses during their retirement years, are not eroded away by waste, fraud and corruption,'' he said. The hearing stemmed from reports issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general office, which pointed to the vulnerability of $ 2 trillion in assets of pension plans covering 76 million Americans. The latest inspector general's report, obtained Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, says billions of dollars in private pension money is not being fully audited because the money was invested in such instiutions as savings and loans. Some <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials dispute the extent of the problems, saying the department's acting inspector general, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, has exaggerated the potential for fraud. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> has likened the potential to the recent savings and loan crisis, which some estimates say will require a $ 100 billion taxpayer bailout. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare benefits, told the hearing, `` The pension system, by any objective measure, has never been healthier.'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, in his testimony, said `` our goal is not to unnecessarily frighten people, but to stimulate concern where such concern is needed, and to avoid potential future crisis.'' He said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than criminal remedies have `` created a window of opportunity for those who would embezzle and steal from plan participants.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pension advisory council, said in an interview that `` not everything in the private pension system is peaches and cream.'' But he added that the inspector general's office has `` inspired unnecessary fear and anxiety.'' Either way, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, there is reason for concern. `` I heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan situation was n't serious five years ago,'' he said `` It seems to me we should have learned from history.'' Concern about the pension system has grown with discovery of a number of multimillion-dollar skimming schemes and with financial difficulties encountered by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures private pensions. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> is $ 1.5 billion in the red, and that deficit could balloon if the agency loses a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case involving <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> deficit `` suggests to me we might have a more serious problem than the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> led us to believe. The hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION> and Employment was billed as a `` review of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to prevent fraud and abuse.'' The subcommittee also was to review the latest inspector general's report, which recommends full audits on a wider array of private pension and health programs. In an earlier study, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s office reported that $ 18.7 million in misused plan assets and administrative violations were found in plans examined in late 1987. But under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, some plans are subject only to partial audits. The plans must be reviewed annually by private accountants, but those audits do not cover what happens to the money when it is invested in institutions such as savings and loans. The assumption was that since S & amp; Ls are subject to their own federal inspections, pension plan assets invested with them need not be audited separately. But following the savings and loan crisis, the new report says the current system provides inadequate protection to working Ameicans whose retirement savings are invested in such plans. `` The well-publicized problems in the savings and loan segment of the industry further illustrate the problems that can occur,'' the report says. The report examined 279 audits completed by private accountants. It found that almost half were not subject to full review. `` The result was that in our audit universe, $ 4.2 billion out of $ 9.8 billion in plan assets -LRB- 43 percent -RRB- were never audited,'' the report said. `` We believe that 43 percent of employee benefit plan assets escaping audit scrutiny is unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s office is asking that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amend <ORGANIZATION> ERISA </ORGANIZATION> to require private accountants to conduct full audits and report infractions directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It also wants the department to lean more heavily toward criminal rather than civil enforcement.

 The high-flying portable computer market will soar to greater heights through the wizardry of notebook-sized machines, tiny color screens and images that `` float,'' industry experts predict. Not everyone goes so far as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> retailer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who flatly predicted Tuesday: `` They are going to replace desktops.'' But from one-pound `` palmtops'' to 20-pounders, there's no doubt about the sales portables are racking up, or the attention they are drawing at this year's Comdex convention, the world's biggest computer show. The overall personal computer market is growing about 10 percent a year. But sales of portables are expected to triple that growth rate for the next three years, and sales of machines in the 8 -LCB- - by-11-inch `` notebook'' format will more than quadruple, predicted <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajarin </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and a leading <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> consultant About 300,000 portables were shipped in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1983, the first year true portables were available, he said at a panel discussion. <PERSON> Bajarin </PERSON> expects shipments of 1.4 million this year and 2.5 million by 1992. Perhaps hottest of all at the show are <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines They are the first of their size to accept 3 -LCB- - inch floppy disks which are now standard for desktop computers <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> officials say their new models are more convenient than other machines which use tiny memory cards or smaller disks _ although makers of other models contend the cards are tomorrow's technology <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the month since they introduced the two machines. The LTE begins at about $ 2,400. The LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286 microprocessor, lists for $ 3,900 to $ 5,000. Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers are the Toshiba T1000SE and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s Ultralite, a pioneer when it was introduced a year ago. The Ultralite weighs just 4.4 pounds, has a bigger screen than the LTE's, and costs about the same. Storage of information is on memory cards. Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops or breast pocket computers. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s Portfolio, which operates on two AA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for $ 400. Not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins, it has five simple built-in programs. At about $ 2,000, <ORGANIZATION> Poqet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s palmtop offers a bigger screen and keyboard, all within the tiny package. `` Our computer now uses about the same amount of power as a single Christmas tree twinkle light,'' meaning it can run for 100 hours on two AA alkaline batteries, said <PERSON> Poquet </PERSON>'s president, <PERSON> Stave </PERSON> <PERSON> Prodromou </PERSON>. Near the other extreme is <ORGANIZATION> Dolch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' `` portable'' that uses <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s new 80486 microprocessor _ the hottest, most powerful chip in the world for personal computers. The industrial-looking <PERSON> Dolch </PERSON> weighs nearly 20 pounds, but the company says it can compete in performance with very high-end desktop computers and work stations. Its price is hefty, too: about $ 13,000 to $ 18,000. Also on display was a laptop called <PERSON> Gridpad </PERSON>. It uses a pen-like device to `` write'' on a document-sized screen, allowing forms to be filled out and even signed on a computer screen. <LOCATION> Cyberspace </LOCATION>'s laptop does away with a screen in favor of headgear that projects a hologram-like image that seems to hang in the air in front of the user. It's pitched as a boon for the security-conscious; no one can look over your shoulder and see what you're writing or reading.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it has reached an agreement to sell its 89 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its insurance unit, for cash and securities to a new company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P </ORGANIZATION>. Under terms of the sale, approved Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s board, the two companies will pay $ 189 million in cash, debt and new stock for <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> and repay or assume $ 120 million in <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> debt, <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> said. Jupiter, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and Head, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had withdrawn an earlier offer of $ 135 million for <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, including <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>, will receive about $ 94 million, or $ 3.04 a share. The remainder will be placed in escrow against potential losses, <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> said. The unused escrowed funds eventually will be returned to shareholders, the company said. Previous agreements to sell <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> called for shareholders to receive as much as $ 7.45 a share, but those efforts fell through for lack of financing or inability to reach a final accord. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>, the Dallas-based real estate and financial services concern which is seeking to reorganize under the protection of federal bankruptcy court, could receive up to $ 43 million in much-needed cash for its 89 percent stake in the life insurance company if the sale is approved. The sale must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and by <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION>'s board and its outside shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> said it anticipates completing the transaction by April 30, 1990, and either party can end the agreement if the sale is n't closed by then. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 109.2 million loss for its insurance group for the third quarter ended March 30. The loss includes a $ 90 million expected deficit from the sale of the group and contributed to the company's $ 1.04 billion third-quarter loss. Jupiter is controlled by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> real estate investor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, and Head, an investment partnership, is managed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> merchant banking firm <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Partners.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement of wheat sales to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Although the sales were relatively small _ 50,000 metric tons apiece at subsidized prices _ traders welcomed the news after Tuesday's announcement that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had canceled purchases of 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. Export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain have been slack lately, and any news of new demand is likely to prompt buying of grain futures. Corn was up slightly while soybeans were mixed, reflecting strength in the soybean meal market and weakness in the soybean oil market. In early trading, wheat futures were -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.02 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.41 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.45 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.79 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent to .17 cent higher with December at 74.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .05 cent higher with November at 83.05 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .50 cent higher with December at 48.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent lower to .80 cent higher with February at 62.80 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Exchange Probes Possible Manipulation of Stock-Options Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the possibility that stock-index options were manipulated as part of program-trading activity, a published report says. The exchange is looking at trading in <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100 stock index options during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge as well as other volatile trading days, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> is the fourth exchange to search for program-trading abuses. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and two other <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges are conducting a separate probe of computer-assisted program trading in stocks and stock-index futures. <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> told the Journal that the exchange is looking at `` sources of volatility,'' including trades, programs or otherwise, that may have involved manipulation or other forms of rule-breaking. `` We are looking at all volatile days,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. `` We have been in touch with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> frequently about the events, and they are well aware of the review that is being conducted.'' Exchange officials did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. For years, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> has been a source of rumors and suspicions about program-trading abuses, the Journal said. Those suspicions partially result from the complexity of options-related program-trading strategies that are only understood by the most sophisticated traders. Additionally, traders say program trades in S & amp; P 100 stock index options have moved the market in the past, the newspaper said. Program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks by computer to take advantage of temporary price differences. A stock option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of a stock index, such as the S & amp; P 100, at a specified price within a specified time. The unique feature of stock-index options is that they are settled by payment in cash, not with delivery or receipt or stocks. Also, S & amp; P 100 options can be exercised at any time before their expiration date. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 options market re-emerged as a popular program-trading vehicle after the 1987 crash. A June 30 <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> memo said `` <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 stock index options were often the second-most heavily used derivative product for index arbitrage from November 1988 to April 1989.'' Program trades involving the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 options accounted for 8 percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume for the six-month period, the commission said.

<HEAD>Year-End Trap in Mutual Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the end of the year approaches, financial advisers are issuing warnings about a trap that can spring on anybody who buys shares of mutual funds. If you are thinking about getting into a fund or making a substantial addition to an existing fund holding before year-end, they say, you should do a little extra research. The subject of that inquiry: Is the fund about to declare its annual distributions of dividends and capital gains? If the answer is yes, the experts say, you might seriously consider waiting to invest your money until after the record, or ex-dividend, date for those distributions, and thus miss sticking yourself with an unnecessary tax obligation. The trap works this way: To qualify for status as investment companies that do n't themselves have to pay taxes, most mutual funds must pass through substantially all of their investment income to their shareholders each year These distributions then become taxable, as dividends or capital gains, to the shareholders. The typical money-market fund or income fund investing in bonds declares its dividends daily, or at least monthly. So it does n't matter much what time of year you choose to invest in these By contrast, many stock funds or others that might earn capital gains _ for example, a fund investing in high-yield `` junk'' bonds that can fluctuate a great deal in price _ make all or a big chunk of their distributions once a year. The effective date of the distribution is often set between mid-December and the end of the year, for payment a few weeks later. If you buy fund shares just before the record date, you put yourself in the position of having some of your capital returned almost immediately to you, burdened with a tax liability, before it has had a chance to earn you any real return. `` You have acquired a share of the other stockholders' profits,'' says <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> in his Handbook For No-Load Fund Investors Suppose, for illustration purposes, that a fund's net asset value stands at $ 20 a share when you buy it just before the ex-distribution date. Then a $ 2 distribution is declared, lowering the net asset value to $ 18. Presumably, you do n't want this `` income'' in cash _ you just put the money into the fund. But even if you have it automatically reinvested in new shares, you ca n't duck the tax liability. No such problem arises if you wait until after the record date. Whatever amount you had set aside to invest will buy proportionately more shares at $ 18 than it would have at $ 20. Stock funds' distributions tend to be especially sizable in bull market years, such as 1989. Information about a fund's plans should be readily available through a simple phone call to the fund before you decide to buy. Of course, if the investment is being made in an individual retirement account or other program that shelters it from current taxes, the timing of distributions does n't matter. But among taxable investors, those who show up at the wrong time are presented with a share of the bill for a party they did n't attend

 In the private and mysterious world of high-powered jewelry dealing, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Groom </PERSON> stands out like a diamond in the rough. Groom, 39, whose firm sold $ 12 million worth of diamonds and colored stones last year, frequently travels to jungles, cavernous mines and other remote spots in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in a constant search for the world's rarest rocks. Like the sailing merchants of centuries past, Groom will barter and trade for many of his stones. He recently swapped a shipload of cement for $ 1 million worth of diamond `` roughs'' from the African nation of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. Groom seeks stones in dangerous, strife-ridden nations, such as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, where he says he is only the third American since 1962 to gain the rights to deal in rubies. Most recently, Groom closed a deal to become the sole distributor of American soft drinks in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. And while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions cloaked in secrecy, Groom, whose manner is outspoken and friendly, seeks the spotlight. He employs his own media publicist who pitches Groom as a modern-day <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` There have been very few dealers who are so public,'' said <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shainberg </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, considered the world's most important diamond exchange. `` The average diamond dealer, for security reasons, does not want such publicity. He's an honest and honorable man. His publicity is good for his business, and good for the rest of us, too.'' Sitting in a small office at his fashionable store in <LOCATION> Ridgewood </LOCATION>, Groom proudly showed off stones with $ 100,000 price tags. The shirt-sleeved <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man, who wore no jewelry, smiled and insisted he is `` not <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.'' `` No intrigue,'' he said. `` But I do have a message.'' Groom says American business can exert a positive influence throughout the world. He is convinced the world respects the American system, but Americans must also understand and respect other cultures. `` In many cultures, the American way does not hold up,'' he said. `` How dare we have that attitude that ours is the only way.'' Groom's story, however, is the stuff of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. He left a successful job as a stockbroker for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 15 years ago after his friend's father urged him to take a gem course that left him `` absolutely fascinated'' with precious stones. <PERSON> Groom </PERSON> said he struggled at first, working 15-hour days in a one-room enterprise as his friends climbed their respective corporate ladders. <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ridgewood </LOCATION> and his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> slowly grew into a business with offices around the globe. Groom does n't just cut deals on the telephone. He hops on planes and goes directly to faraway mines to pick out his own stones and diamond roughs. One of the few dealers who sells both diamonds and colored stones, Groom is the consummate frequent flyer, logging more than 150,000 miles each year. `` I wanted to do things differently,'' he said. `` I think running just a single jewelry store is boring.'' Avoiding boredom means taking risks. Amid a treasure trove of jewelry in the vault at his store is an envelope that bears the remnants of a dramatic failure. It was a diamond that, at the final stages of cutting in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> operation, `` exploded.'' The diamond's glitter was suddenly replaced by a dull mist. `` It was my fault,'' he said, explaining that he had failed to check a crucial stress point in the rock. `` It's absolutely worthless now. It would have sold for $ 80,000. Eighty thousand dollars down the drain.'' <PERSON> Groom </PERSON> said he draws energy from his work. `` There's a science to picking stones in the jungle,'' he said. `` Then you go to the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and pull up your shirt sleeves and wheel and deal. Some Saturdays, I'll simply work the floor of this stoor, helping an old lady who needs a $ 10 soldering job on a broken chain.'' <PERSON> Groom </PERSON> said he has changed since his younger days. `` I have mellowed,'' <PERSON> Groom </PERSON> said. `` Once, there was pure aggressiveness, the hardball selling technique. Now I have a different philosophy. We went through a period when we did things just for money. I do n't do it for the money. I can go to sleep every night knowing we do things with integrity.''

<HEAD>Risen From Ashes, Swiss Watchmakers Face Challenges Of '90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIENNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Perestroika has hit <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s once-moribund watch industry: a recently launched wristwatch has a hammer and sickle for hands and a red dial with Russian lettering The perestroika model illustrates how sharp marketing with an eye for fashion have helped restore Swiss power in world watch markets. Swiss watchmakers are headed for their third straight year of record revenue, buoyed by the success of the plastic-case Swatch, a quartz-controlled timepiece in trendy designs. Sixty million have been sold since 1983. `` We are the only ones to show we can hold off the Japanese in mass production,'' says <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON>, board president of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s main watchmaking conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> SMH </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for three-quarters of industry exports. He warns against complacency. Cost control and product development are the bywords in countering Asian competition in the fight for an estimated 500 million customers annually. New medium-priced Swiss models, some using stylish hardwood or stone cases, also recaptured ground from Japanese manufacturers. The luxury watch trade, a traditional Swiss preserve, is booming. In the 1970s, <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> producers rose to dominance. The Swiss industry, unable to match their cheap digital watches and facing high labor costs, posted big losses. Nowadays it has trouble finding enough qualified workers. With the major economies prospering, consumers will pay for watches that are fashion accessories, not just time-tellers. Swatches come in seasonal collections that now total several hundred models. But a competitive Swiss industry re-emerged only after its 1970 workforce of 76,000 shrunk to about 30,000 and two-thirds of the factories shut down. The crisis spelled doom for scattered small shops making the more than 100 parts for a fully mechanical watch. Neat but disused plants still dot western <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s watchmaking belt. <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON> was tapped in the mid-1980s by commercial banks propping up an ailing industry in which they were key shareholders. `` They said we have no more possibilities to fight Japanese and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> low-cost production, we'd better stop making watches,'' <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON>, management consultant by trade, said in an interview at <ORGANIZATION> SMH </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` We came back with a report saying the contrary.'' <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomke </PERSON>, who conceived Swatch and now is <ORGANIZATION> SMH </ORGANIZATION> chief executive, named the problems in 1982 near the peak of the crisis. He charged watchmakers had not pulled together and knew little about their foreign markets, where more than 90 percent of Swiss watches and movements are sold. Consolidated, automated and infused with talent, the industry last year reported sales of $ 3.1 billion, a third more than the once-leading Japanese. Another 20 percent-plus increase is expected this year. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is the top Swiss market, re-exporting most of the shipments. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> follow. `` Every brand has a message. It has to be clear, understandable and unique,'' says <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON>, 61, who wears three Swiss watches on his arm. Swatch grabbed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European buyers with pop colors, designs including see-through models and numberless faces, and a relatively low price, about $ 31 in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. A conservative touch _ there are no digital versions _ did n't hurt. Enterprising Swiss soon launched other novelties such as a clip-on watch. <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> mother and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> father, has run up enough successes in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to be able to operate with maverick flair. Until recently, he says the watchmakers had been `` doing things the same way for 200 years'' in a society `` where people are not used to overcoming challenges.'' <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON> outlines the challenge of the 1990s: `` Our worry is that the Swiss watch industry does not make enough efforts to sell more watches,'' he says. `` Not only more expensive watches, but more watches.'' Industry leaders warn still more must be done to mass-market `` Swiss-made.'' A new push is on in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where costly advertising copied from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market had failed to generate major Swatch sales. <PERSON> Thomke </PERSON> warns `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is stealing the show'' by focusing on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, until very recently <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s top export market. But <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, producing at twice the Swiss rate, is running minimal profits. Earnings in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s currently reorganizing industry also are flat, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> SMH </ORGANIZATION> has diversified into telephones and other electronics fields. Group profits rose 36 percent last year to $ 66 million, and <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON> is looking for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment possibilities. `` You have to keep your armies motivated all the time,'' <PERSON> Hayek </PERSON> says.

 A state appeals court today threw out <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s convictions of former <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> and a former president in connection with the thrift's collapse in 1985 Both <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> have been free on bond appealing their March 1987 convictions. The collapse of Cincinnanti-based Home State in 1985 triggered <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s savings and loan crises of that year. A three-judge panel of the 1st <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also threw out a lower court's order that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> pay $ 22 million in restitution to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and $ 250,000 in prosecution costs, and that <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> pay $ 25,000 in prosecution costs. The appeals court said the cost and restitution penalties were based on a statement of fees submitted by the state that had not been certified as correct and legal by either the prosecutor or the clerk of the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Court. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> were convicted after a four-month trial in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The jury convicted <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> of six charges that he oversaw unauthorized transfers of Home State money to a major securities trading partner, <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Home State collapsed on March 8, 1985, four days after <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> was shut down by federal regulators for insolvency Home State had invested heavily with <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> through securities trades and lost $ 144 million when <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> closed. The jury also convicted <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of three counts that he committed securities violations by failing to give a true picture of Home State's financial status in circulars advertising the 1984 sale of Home State bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, a millionaire businessman and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, was cleared by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, of fraud and conspiracy charges in the failure of Home State. Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately insured <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> savings and loans institutions whose deposits were insured by the same agency. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> temporarily closed the thrifts and ordered them to obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with companies that had it before reopening. Home State later was sold and reopened in June 1985 under new ownership.

 The rhetoric is heating up as <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pursues its spurned bid to buy <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.1 billion, though both forest-products companies deny any nasty intent. Great Northern earlier this week rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> offer in a pair of sharply worded letters, one to its shareholders and the other to <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> responded with a statement to the media that bluntly questioned the motives of Great Northern's management in turning down the $ 58-a-share offer. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> announced today that it has lined up commitments for $ 4.5 billion from 19 domestic and international banks to fund the takeover. The company said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, its primary bank since the 1950s, has agreed to provide $ 1.25 billion of the amount. Also Tuesday, Great Northern announced it was challenging a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that cleared <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> to include <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s four railroads in the proposed acquisition. <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, Conn.-based Great Northern said the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> approved the clearance in one day when the process usually takes months. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> `` cut corners'' and engaged in `` questionable tactics'' to get the ruling, <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> said. But Great Northern Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> told The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution that he did not mean for his letter to <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to seem sarcastic or harsh. And <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said in an interview at his company's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters Tuesday that he saw straightforwardness, not anger, in Great Northern's statements. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> also said he did not expect <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which he once described as `` a company of nice people,'' to get nasty as it tangles over the offer. `` I would hope not,'' he said. `` If you come and offer me 50 percent or more -LRB- profit -RRB- for more of my assets, I would think you're an awfully friendly guy. And I would probably embrace you for doing that. `` So I do n't see how offering a company 50 percent or more premium for what its assets have been selling for for the past two years would be considered unfriendly,'' he said. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> plans to continue its pursuit of Great Northern, but declined to discuss strategy. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said all aspects of the proposal are negotiable, though he said the offer as it stands provides excellent short-term benefits for Great Northern shareholders and good long-term prospects for his company. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> also dismissed concerns raised by Great Northern about antitrust implications of the proposed deal. He said he was not worried, either, about an anti-takeover regulations in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where Great Northern is incorporated, that some say could block the deal. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said various conditions _ <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s confidence in the strength of the industry, the company's ability to handle the debt from a takeover and the compatibility of the two companies _ made the time right to launch the bid. A takeover of Great Northern would be one of the largest acquisitions ever for <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, a company that has often used buyouts to grow over 62 years. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> started in 1927 as a lumberyard in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, when founder <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheatham </PERSON> made a $ 12,000 investment to start a hardwood wholesale business known originally as the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The company soon began to manufacture hardwood lumber, too. During World War II, it was the largest supplier of lumber to the military. After the war, in 1947, the company made its first <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> acquisition, a plywood plant in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. A string of acquisitions followed over the next 10 years It was during the 1950s, too, that the company changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and moved its headquarters to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, where it remained until coming to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1982. The company's roster of acquisitions continued to grow in the'60s and'70s; purchases from coast to coast included paper mills, a gypsum company, chemical plants, a kraft pulp mill, timberlands, sawmills and an oil company. Last year, the company spent $ 841 million on acquisitions. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> also decided about 1983 to focus more narrowly on its pulp-and-paper and building products businesses. That resulted in the divestiture of some of its underperforming assets, notably the commodity chemicals business, which became <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Great Northern, as <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> sees it, fits right in with the company's growth pattern It explains why <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> is not worried about a `` white knight'' riding in to win <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> in a bidding war, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` We believe that through the strategic combinations of the two businesses ... Great Northern is more valuable to <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> than it is to any other company,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. Great Northern had 1988 sales of $ 3.6 billion. The company owns 3.5 million acres of timberland and has 20,000 employees at mills and factories in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> had $ 9.5 billion in sales last year, making paper, other forest products and building materials. It owns 6.5 million acres of timberland and 380 plants and mills employing 44,000 workers.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today announced it has reached agreement with a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> property investment firm to refinance the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the world's tallest building and the retailer's corporate headquarters. The $ 850 million refinancing deal delays a sale of the 110-story skyscraper in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for at least 15 years. <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a limited partnership managed by <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Waltch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will finance a 15-year mortgage on the tower and related properties and have an option to buy the building, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. The deal will produce net proceeds of $ 815 million for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, which had contemplated selling the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> landmark. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to close the deal by the middle of next summer. The company said that `` as a result of lower interest rates and the positive long-term prospects for the commercial real-estate market, this financing transaction offers more net cash and attractive features than alternative structures.'' Just over a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced its intention to sell the 15-year-old tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to halt a slide in its profitability. The restructuring, which brought major changes in the retailer's merchandising and pricing policies, also included moving <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' retail division headquarters from the tower to an office complex that will be built in suburban <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> began exploring the refinancing option in September after a prospective sale of the 1,707-foot building to Canadian developer <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> collapsed.

 The nation's only offshore port for supertankers has n't had a serious spill in eight years of operation, but it has n't had a profit, either. The clean but poor <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Offshore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> is touted as a savior of the environment by some and a financial failure by others, leaving uncertain whether it will be a model for other ports around the country. Known as LOOP, the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Offshore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> sits 19 miles off the coast in 115 feet of water _ deep enough for the biggest tankers in the world to tie up and unload their crude cargo. When it was proposed in 1972, supporters said it would cost $ 250 million, create tens of thousands of jobs and stimulate onshore investments. Environmentalists fought the idea, warning that it was had the potential for oil spills that could devastate <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s fragile wetlands. Both sets of predictions were confounded. LOOP cost more than $ 700 million and has yet to make a profit. However, it has been so clean that <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> thinks building more deep-water ports around the country would help avoid spills like one in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` The loss of oil has been just a thimble-full from every barrel that's been through there,'' he said after a visit to the port in September. `` And it confirms my original thought that the way to avoid oil spills is to make sure that tankers do n't run aground. That's what's happened in all our oil spills. LOOP looks like a three-deck offshore oil platform. Around it, 1 -LCB- miles away, are three buoys like floating, 42-foot-tall bird cages. Tankers tie up to those buoys while they pump oil through long hoses attached to concrete bases on the ocean floor. The five owners, in order of the size of their stakes, are <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The consortium is responsible for paying off the bonds for the project, which were issued by a state agency to qualify for tax-exempt status. Former Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told reporters in 1974, shortly before taking office: `` The projections are that it could pay for itself in less than 10 years.'' Instead LOOP, after eight years of operation, still owes $ 565 million on $ 731 million in bonds, said controller <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simoneaux </PERSON>. It is handling about half the projected 63 million gallons of crude oil a day. It lost money until last year, when it broke even for the first time. Will it make a profit this year? `` I'd rather not comment on that,'' said R.C. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, president of LOOP, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of five oil companies which own and operate the platform. LOOP depends on strong demand for imported oil, and backers were stunned when Americans responded to the 1970s jump in oil prices by conserving. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of oil rose far less than expected in the 1970s and actually fell into the mid-1980s. LOOP's prospects have improved now that oil imports are rising again. Nationally, imports averaged about 8 million barrels a day for the first 10 months of 1989. LOOP is geared to oil hauled from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in supertankers _ behemoths which can not get into most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. `` Ironically, for LOOP to be successful, you have to import foreign oil,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said earlier this year. Oil imports are up around the country. `` That makes me believe that oil ports would be successful in other places,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. LOOP has been almost squeaky clean. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> estimates that, out of 1.5 billion barrels of oil brought ashore since 1981, 850 have spilled. That works out to about a teaspoonful for every 2,300 gallons moved. Three gallons spilled in all of 1987. LOOP's location eliminates the threat of groundings and lessens the chance that a spill could come ashore. Radar keeps a continuous sweep over a 36-square-mile safety zone and special mooring masters guide the big ships to and from LOOP's buoys. `` <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it's going to cost them $ 1.5 billion to clean up Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and the surrounding area. ... Would n't it be better to spend $ 1.5 billion to prevent oil spills than to spend it cleaning it up?'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. Environmentalists are n't convinced that superports are the answer. Alternatives could include building tankers with double hulls, improving traffic control and reactivating <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> stations, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, senior scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In addition, said <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, construction and maintenance of such ports also could hurt the environment, and beaches can be affected by spills 20 miles away. `` In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, within a few hours you had a spill that had covered 25 square miles,'' she said. `` Offshore spills can still impact the shore.'' And $ 1.5 billion is a drop in the barrel of possible costs for a system of offshore ports such as <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> envisions, with deep-water ports off of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. To replicate LOOP would cost more than $ 800 million and probably more than $ 1 billion, by various estimates. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>, marine transportation associate with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said he's seen estimates as high as $ 2 billion. On top of that, oil users such as refineries that now get direct deliveries would have to hook up to a network of as-yet-unbuilt pipelines. Building those could be even more expensive than building the ports, <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> said.

 Former Wall Street stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was out of prison on a temporary release on the third anniversary of his plea agreement that settled insider trading charges, authorities said. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is due back at the minimum-security prison at <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about the end of the month, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolahan </PERSON>, the prison's supervisor of education, said Tuesday The furlough began last Thursday. The purpose of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s furlough and his whereabouts were not known. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> declined to comment on the furlough. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was spending his time in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The paper also published photos that showed <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> with a scraggly white beard and long locks reminiscent of the late, eccentric millionaire <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. It said the pictures were taken two days ago. <PERSON> Wolahan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> applied for the temporary release, which was approved by the prison warden. <PERSON> Wolahan </PERSON> said inmates who request furloughs must demonstrate a need for the release, but he would n't disclose <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s reasons <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> on Nov. 14, 1986, paid $ 100 million and agreed to plead guilty to one felony to settle charges in Wall Street's biggest insider trading scandal. The 52-year-old former arbitrager is eligible for release on good behavior from a three-year term at the <ORGANIZATION> Lompoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> next April. He entered the prison, where he has been working on a cleanup crew making 11 cents an hour, in March 1988. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in April denied a request to reduce <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s sentence on the grounds that information <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> gave the government led to more than a dozen other civil or criminal cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The judge noted <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation but said his sentence was `` not unjust. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> provided information that resulted in a record $ 650 million plea-bargain settlement by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the indictment of former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>.

<HEAD>British Airways' Profit Up 16.5 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported that its net profit jumped 16.5 percent in the second quarter of its fiscal year, boosted by strong passenger traffic. The airline, one of the world's largest, said its net profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 106 million British pounds, or around $ 172 million, from 91 million pounds, or $ 147.4 million, a year earlier. Per-share earnings increased 16.7 percent to 14.7 pence, or 23.8 cents, from 12.6 pence, or 20.4 cents. `` Our profits for the second quarter are the highest yet reported for those three months by any airline in the world,'' Lord King, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' chairman, said in a statement. The airline reported increased passenger traffic for the period, including a one-month record in September of 2.2 million passengers carried. Much of the growth came on flights between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the company said. Second-quarter revenue rose 13.4 percent to 1.4 billion pounds, or $ 2.2 billion, from 1.2 billion pounds, or $ 1.9 billion. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> withdrew from a group led by pilots and top managers seeking to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 6.75 billion, after the group failed to obtain adequate financing for the deal. The British airline had planned to invest $ 750 million in Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, in return for a 15 percent stake in the company. King said in the statement <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> was `` disappointed'' that its proposed investment in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> fell through. `` We will of course look for any new investment opportunities,'' he said. Talks on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> possibly taking a stake in the Belgian airline <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> are continuing, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. He said fuel costs increased 22 percent in the six months ended Sept. 30 and, like most European airlines, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> also had to bear the costs of delays and disruptions caused by inadequate air traffic control facilities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' capacity has been reduced by the late delivery of its new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 aircraft, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union has been on strike against Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since Oct. 4. For the six months ended Sept. 30, net profit rose 16.7 percent to 168 million pounds, or around $ 265 million, from 144 million pounds, or $ 227 million. Per-share earnings were up 16.5 percent to 23.3 pence, or 36.8 cents, from 20.0 pence, or 32.4 cents. Six-month revenue advanced 14.2 percent to 2.53 billion pounds, or $ 3.99 billion, from 2.2 billion pounds, or $ 3.47 billion.

 The stock market pieced together a modest gain today, rebounding from Tuesday's setback. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday, rose 8.81 to 2,619.06 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 767 up, 624 down and 515 unchanged. Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to the monthly report from the government Thursday on the nation's international trade position Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade deficit of about $ 9 billion, down from $ 10.8 billion in August. Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent weakening trend of corporate earnings. Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments, stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has relaxed its credit policy lately in an evident effort to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy.

 Smirnoff vodka will be pitching a literacy campaign rather than bottles of booze this Christmas. Tobacco, beer and consumer products giant <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is spending $ 60 million on ads celebrating the Bill of Rights. <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dumped its regular fast-food ads over the past month and aired commercials appealing for money for disaster relief efforts. What's going on here? Have these companies lost their heads _ shucking the pursuit of profit in an altruistic frenzy, egged on by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vision of a kinder and gentler society? Or have they discovered that there is prestige to be gained, attention to be grabbed and money to be made by linking their names to fashionable causes? The answer may lie somewhere in between, although some marketing experts warn that companies who try to use altruism as a screen for seamier bottom-line objectives risk a consumer backlash. `` There is a limit to how much you can wrap yourself in the flag,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, vice chairman and creative director at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, an advertising agency based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` A lot of consumers are already coming away with the start of a cynical viewpoint of this thing.'' Companies have been associating themselves with noble causes for years. `` Companies want to get the positive association, the rub-off benefit of whatever institution or cause they are linking themselves to,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geyser </PERSON>, professor of marketing at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Dozens of companies lined up, for instance, to sponsor events tied to the restoration of the Statue of Liberty. The Olympics offer an opportunity for companies to cash in every four years on nationalistic fervor. Members Only went further, dropping its pitches for stylish clothes three years ago and spending all its advertising money on anti-drug messages. Even without product advertising, its sales have risen 22 percent to about $ 100 million since taking the new tack in the fall of 1986. But getting a sales lift is rarely the immediate objective of spending money on good causes. More often, companies simply want to improve their image. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenshine </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of the advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> BBDO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION>, said companies promote good causes so consumers see them `` as having a social or community conscience.'' That is particularly important, he said, in an era where competing products or services in many areas are viewed as being essentially the same. A shopper deciding which beer or burgers to buy may understandably be swayed to the company that has shown in its advertising that it shares the same values. `` It helps differentiate them from the competition,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chairman of the advertising department at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Critics warn the do-good approach has its limits, and that savvy consumers could turn on companies who use altruism as a screen for self-serving efforts to boost market share or to ward off the regulators. `` Companies have to recognize they are on thin ice here,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` If they pretend they are doing it only for the cause, it casts a shadow on everything they do.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has come under attack from some consumer and health groups who say the company is using the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights in a cynical effort to reinforce its cigarette unit's campaigns for smokers' rights. The critics are further enraged that <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> struck a deal that allows it to associate itself with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in ads that include views of the Capitol rotunda and voices of former presidents and other leaders. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said it backed the campaign to draw attention to an important national anniversary and to its own corporate diversification, and denies that the ads were designed to help protect the cigarette business from further regulation. The marketers of Smirnoff vodka are spending their entire $ 1 million holiday ad budget this year on ads for <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group based in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that recruits volunteers to teach adults how to read. `` Help Smirnoff end illiteracy in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the ads say. The Smirnoff logo appears in the corner. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Traynor </PERSON>, a marketing executive for the <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> division that sells Smirnoff, said <PERSON> Smirnoff </PERSON> felt a cause-related campaign would help its ads stand out without resorting to the `` gimmicks'' such as musical computer chips that other liquor brands have used in their Christmas ads. He said backing a cause would also appeal to Smirnoff drinkers' `` traditional values.'' Smirnoff is contributing $ 100,000 outright, paying for ads that solicit donations and setting up special displays with a canister in liquor stores for contributions. Two of the group's 370 chapters _ in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> _ declined to participate `` It's a hard choice to make when you are desperate for money,'' admitted <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION>'s Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, who heads a community group affiliated with Literacy Volunteers. Miami-based Burger King had already begun promoting its BK Double hamburgers when an earthquake struck the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area last month. Chief executive <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> told his admakers that <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> should `` give something back'' to communities struck by earthquakes and hurricanes. The ads pledge to donate 25 cents to the Red Cross for each BK Double sold through Nov. 23. The appeal raised $ 3 million in the first two weeks of the four-week promotion. Still, the approach does n't sit well with critics like <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` While what <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was doing was good, it was n't completely noble when they told me I had to buy a Whopper,'' he said

<HEAD>Two Twin Cities Radio Stations Offer Pieces Of Berlin Wall To Listeners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Twin Cities radio stations say they have made deals to acquire small pieces of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and will give them away to listeners. A third station called the idea `` pretty tacky.'' KDWB-FM made the first offer Monday morning when announcer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> invited listeners to win a piece of the wall by calling the station. The 25th caller wins. KJJO-FM expects to start its promotion Friday. It will give away its 40 small pieces by asking listeners to call when they hear songs with `` wall'' in the titles. `` Already capitalism is working,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, operations manager and program director of <ORGANIZATION> KJJO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boen </PERSON>, general manager at <ORGANIZATION> KTCZ </ORGANIZATION> said he was non-committal when a radio syndicate offered his station pieces of the wall. `` My reaction was the same as my program director's: Some people will sell anything,'' <PERSON> Boen </PERSON> said. The promotion `` trivializes the whole episode,'' he said. `` It kind of hit us as pretty tacky.'' Powers said he received a call Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> Jameson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which syndicates programs to stations around the country. <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> had acquired a section of the wall from a German affiliate and `` is using a stonemason to make these little cubes,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. The price was $ 500 for 40 pieces sealed in plastic and accompanied by signed certificates. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said he did n't think the giveaway cheapens the event. `` It's a way of bringing it home,'' he said.

<HEAD>Postal Service Becomes Sponsor of 1992 Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it has become an official sponsor of the 1992 Olympic Games. Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> cited three reasons for the action _ improving the image of the agency, generating increased revenues and supporting the Olympics. Being a worldwide sponsor of the Olympics will cost between $ 10 million and $ 15 million, said Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON>. But it is expected to generate $ 300 million to $ 400 million in increased revenues for the service through added business in the small parcel and express mail business and the sale of special Olympic goods to collectors, he said. Every dollar in increased revenues is a dollar that does n't have to be obtained from higher postage rates, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. The sponsorship costs will be shared by many other national postal services, which will become sub-sponsors of the worldwide Olympics and, like the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service, sponsors of their national Olympic teams. Costs will be divided according to the size of each country and its mail volume. Those sponsorships include the right to use Olympic symbols on equipment and products, including stamps issued on connection with the event. The 1992 Winter Games will be held in <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and the Summer Games will be in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Twenty-two other national postal services have already signed on as sub-sponsors of the 1992 Olympics, <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said. They are <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Treasury Chief Says Economy Must Slow Down To Cut Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> faces a difficult year in 1990 with continued high inflation and a slowdown in economic growth to 1.25 percent, Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said Wednesday. Last year's economic growth rate of 4.4 percent will be cut by more than half to 2 percent this year, he said. But the economy must slow down to bring surging inflation `` decisively down, and keep it down,'' <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said in his first autumn statement to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> outlining the government's public spending plans. The new treasury chief made it clear that he has little intention of easing tight monetary or fiscal policy, leaving the prospect of continued high interest and mortgage rates and tight control on government spending. But Major announced expenditures above the expected rate of inflation in some key, and politically sensitive, areas: the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, public transportation, higher education and the homeless. Major's statement, three weeks after he replaced <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> as treasury chief, caused little stir on financial markets and was welcomed by industry chiefs. `` It was a realistic prognosis of hard times,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chief British economist at <ORGANIZATION> UBS-Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s treasury spokesman, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> that the government's `` economic miracle'' had been revealed as a `` hollow sham.'' The British government considers inflation its top economic problem and has raised base lending rates from a low of 7.5 percent last year to their current 15 percent level in an effort to choke inflationary pressures. The annual rate of inflation rose to a peak of 8.3 percent in June and currently stands at 7.6 percent, among the highest of Western industrialized nations. `` I expect it to remain high for some months'' before falling to 5.75 percent in the last quarter of 1990, Major said. Inflation is running at a far higher level than <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> forecast in the March budget, when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s revenue-raising plans were unveiled. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had predicted a 5.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter of this year dipping to 4.5 percent by the second quarter of next year. `` Our main priority must be to bring inflation decisively down, and keep it down,'' Major said. `` To achieve this, the economy must slow down for a while. This does mean that 1990 may not be an easy year. But the economy enters the 1990s in incomparably better shape than it entered the 1980s.'' The chancellor forecast a steep rise this year in the country's current account deficit, which includes invisible trade such as overseas investment earnings as well as merchandise trade The deficit will soar to 20 billion pounds, or $ 31.6 billion, in 1989 from last year's 14.6 billion pounds, or $ 23 billion. This was a 38 percent increase over <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s March forecast of a deficit of 14.5 billion pounds, or $ 22.9 billion, this year. Major projected a 1990 deficit of 15 billion pounds, or $ 24 billion, as the economy braked and the demand for imports shrank. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had said that a widening current account deficit this year should n't be of significant concern, maintaining it was due to heavy investment in British industry and was not chiefly the result of consumer spending. Major, however, linked the shortfall to unanticipated growth in consumer spending. But he said that he anticipated improvement in 1990 due to growth of already strong exports and a reduction in domestic demand. `` As domestic demand slows, import growth should moderate,'' Major said. `` At the same time, the strong rise in exports, which has been one of the most welcome developments in 1989, is forecast to continue.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will enjoy a budget surplus of 12.5 billion pounds, or $ 19.8 billion, in the current fiscal year ending March 31, but Major said it will be lower than <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s forecast because of less income than expected from the privatization of nationalized industries.

 The stock market turned upward today, rebounding from Tuesday's setback. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday, rose 12.50 to 2,622.75 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 835 up, 599 down and 501 unchanged. Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to the monthly report from the government Thursday on the nation's international trade position Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade deficit of about $ 9 billion, down from $ 10.8 billion in August. Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent weakening trend of corporate earnings. Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments, stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has relaxed its credit policy lately in an evident effort to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy. But some observers have questioned whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> acted early enough or emphatically enough to stave off trouble.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today refused for the second day in the row to shut off debate on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed capital-gains tax cut, killing the issue for the year. The vote was 51-47, nine short of the 60 required to limit debate. The margin was the same on Tuesday. `` In the end, we will win this battle'' next year, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., said after the first vote <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders had agreed in advance that the two days of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on the proposal would put the issue to rest until next year. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier today, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, `` We consider yesterday's vote just the beginning.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised a capital gains cut in last year's presidential campaign as a way to encourage investment and create jobs. The proposal has dominated debate over budget issues for several months. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, pleaded for Democratic loyalty and assailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for spending so much effort to win the cut. A reduction, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, would bloat the deficit by tens of billions of dollars in the long run and serve up a major tax windfall for the nation's richest people. `` This amendment evinces no concern about investment or with the future,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It is concerned only with the present and the political benefits that may flow from cutting taxes ... `` Given our circumstances, when so many in our nation are without decent housing, can not afford an education, lack health insurance, it is a travesty that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should now be seriously considering a huge tax cut for the very wealthy with no evidence that it will assist the economy,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Economists estimate that 80 percent of the benefit of a cut in taxes on capital gains _ profits from the sale of investments _ would go to people with incomes above $ 100,000 a year. Those with incomes above $ 200,000 would get tax cuts averaging $ 24,000. Republicans accused opponents of engaging in class-warfare rhetoric. `` This is a situation where everyone gains,'' said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, contending a tax cut would benefit investors while producing increased revenue for the government to spend on social programs. `` You do n't get many deals better than that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with backing of one of every four Democrats, approved a different capital gains cut in September. Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates that apply to wages and other income. The Packwood-Roth plan would mean lower taxes for capital gains; the longer an asset was held, the less of the profit from its sale would be taxed. Only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset owned more than one year would be taxed. That percentage would increase by five points for each additional year up to seven; only 65 percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more than seven years is sold. Investments in smaller companies would get an even better break; up to 50 percent could escape taxation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal, written by <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., would combine a capital gains tax cut with expanded Individual Retirement Accounts Unlike existing IRAs, which permit some workers to avoid tax on contributions of up to $ 2,000 a year, the new version would simply exempt from tax any inerest earned on an IRA. In addition, a worker could make penalty-free withdrawals from the new IRAs for paying medical or education expenses.

<HEAD>Slumping Regional Real Estate Market Leading to Rise In Foreclosures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An increasing number of residential properties are being sold on the auction block as the region's slumping real estate market prompts foreclosures on homes and developments that have trouble attracting buyers. `` We are seeing some foreclosures in our area. Where there used to be one or two, now there seems to be more,'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>, co-owner of Century 21 <ORGANIZATION> Sager </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. The state <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has seen a steep increase in foreclosures and auctions of all kinds across <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, although banking officials say owners of single-family homes have not been hit as hard as condominium developers. In 1987, 253 foreclosure filings culminated with an auction, meaning no one stepped in to pay off the mortgage. Last year the number rose to 546 and this year the total already has reached 1,100. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Trombly </PERSON>, recorder for the court, said the figures are not broken down into specific categories. `` It's everything,'' he said. `` It's condos. It's people who get laid off at <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> who get in over their heads.'' Banking officials blame much of the trouble on a real estate boom earlier this decade that led to an oversupply of building space, especially in condominiums. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which manages assets for banks, said some of the outlying areas from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> have been particularly troublesome for developers trying to sell condominiums. `` I think it's very clear in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> there was a bit more optimism exhibited than there should have been,'' <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said. `` Certainly there was not a lot of sober thought given to some of these projects.'' `` The foreclosures have accelerated at an accelerating pace,'' he said. `` Bankruptcy is a growth industry. And unfortunately, there is a lot of human suffering.'' Such an example came earlier this year, when <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Southborough </LOCATION>, the state's largest housing developer headquartered in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, filed for bankruptcy protection. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> blamed the region's slow real estate market for his company's problems. Bankruptcy filings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> are up about 50 percent from last year, and more than half are related to real estate projects, said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trustee whose office monitors bankruptcy cases for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> region. <PERSON> Greiman </PERSON> said many people file for bankruptcy protection from creditors to buy time in the foreclosure process. `` You have developers with all these condo projects and no one buying them, so they have no cash flow to meet their expenses,'' she said. While condominium developers have been hit hard, bank officials say owners of single-family homes have not had as much trouble. Foreclosures on houses correlate less directly to the real estate market and stem more from general economic conditions, such as unemployment, which result in people having trouble paying their bills. Despite a wave recent layoffs in the high tech industry, regional unemployment remains relatively low, so forecasts of a recession have not yet translated to a surge of foreclosures on houses, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> BancBoston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that about 1.6 percent of his bank's residential loans are delinquent, compared with about 1.5 percent at the same time last year. Firms that conduct auctions, nonetheless, report that some homeowners are losing their houses to foreclosure. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Enik </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION>, said many of these people bought second homes, such as around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, and now are having trouble making payments. These people also have trouble selling the homes because they were bought when prices were peaking, and the houses end up being auctioned. `` They thought they can always sell the property in the worst case,'' <PERSON> Enik </PERSON> said. `` But a lot of them can not sell.''

<TEXT>
 The value of farmland in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> continues to rebound and agricultural bankers in five states expect interest in the land market to be active through this winter, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> analyst said Wednesday. A new survey of 500 bankers by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said the value of farmland in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> rose 1.7 percent during the third quarter of 1989. `` We've had quite a sharp rebound in farm-sector earnings and that has been an important factor in the increases in farmland values,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, analyst for the reserve bank. `` In addition, people's expectations of the future have improved and one factor is the uptrend in farm exports,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> added. `` People think that trend in exports will continue.'' Farmland values in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> peaked around 1981 and then began a decline that lasted more than five years and cut the price of some farmland in half. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said the recovery began late in 1986. `` Many of the bankers expect the farmland market to remain active this fall and winter, with continued interest by both farmer and nonfarmer investors,'' he said. There was some variation in farmland values among the five <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states during July, August and September. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> farmland values rose 3.6 percent during the third quarter, while <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> posted gains of about 2 percent. There was virtually no change in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> from the second quarter. On an annual basis, farmland values in the five states are up 8 percent from a year ago. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> logged the biggest increases with 9 percent increases. The smallest gain was <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 4 percent. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said nearly 32 percent of the bankers surveyed expect the value of farmland in their areas to rise during the fourth quarter of this year. Interest rates on real-estate loans, which had risen over a two-year period ending early this year, have recorded two consecutive quarterly declines, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said. The average rate at the end of the third quarter was 11.34 percent. Many bankers expect both farmers and other investors to buy more farmland in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> through early spring. `` More than a third of the respondents stated they expect the volume of farmland transfers over the next six months to be higher than the comparable period of a year ago, while an additional 53 percent expect no change,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>. More than 36 percent of the bankers surveyed said they expect the demand for farmland to increase among investors who are not currently farming, he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> removed the `` for sale'' sign Wednesday from the world's tallest building, saying it had decided not to sell <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> but to use it as collateral for an $ 850 million loan. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to sign by mid-summer a 15-year convertible mortgage agreement with <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a limited partnership formed by <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waltch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a pension fund real-estate investment manager based in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The deal will provide <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> with $ 815 million after expenses and give <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> an option to buy the 110-story downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> landmark at the end of the loan period, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. If <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION> chooses to take possession of the 1,707-foot building rather than accept repayment of the loan, <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said, the partnership would be required to pay <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> the balance of the tower's full 1989 value as well as a portion of its appreciated value. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer and a financial-services leader, announced just over a year ago that it would sell its 15-year-old headquarters building as part of a corporate restructuring designed to halt a slide in its profits. But after a prospective sale of the tower to Canadian developer <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fell through in September, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> decided to take advantage of a drop in interest rates and refinance the tower, which it owns free and clear. When <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced plans on Oct. 31, 1988, to sell the building, `` we said that what we wanted to do was take out the appreciated value of this asset to invest in our core businesses and repurchase 10 percent of our shares,'' <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said. `` While a sale seemed to be a better way to achieve our objectives when we made this announcement, by the time we did this deal, financing the building was a better alternative,'' he said. Interest rates on long-term loans for prime real estate such as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> have fallen by as much as a full percentage point, to about 9 percent, in the past year, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oharenko </PERSON>, managing partner in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a commercial real-estate firm. Commercial real-estate loans typically reflect up to 80 percent of a property's fair market value, he said. <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will use proceeds from the tower deal to pay down debt incurred through its repurchase over the past year of about 40 million shares of its stock at about $ 40 a share, and to invest in its core businesses, which include the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> retailing division, <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> brokerage services, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> insurance and Coldwell Banker real estate. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' restructuring also includes a plan to move its retailing headquarters from <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> to a yet-to-be built office complex in suburban <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> by the end of 1992. Some of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s commercial real estate experts have said the 2 million square feet of office space to be vacated by the retailing division is badly in need of remodeling, both to modernize the facilities and to subdivide it into smaller areas. <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> indicated that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> would be doing some remodeling in the tower. `` Even though it's a world-class building, we're aware of the fact there are opportunities to enhance its value and we'll be doing that,'' he said.

 Desktop video for personal computers is finally getting past the hype stage, many computer experts say. New computers and software let users knit writing and sounds together with graphics, video and animation in a package that lets the user control the images and `` talk back.'' Interactive multimedia or desktop video, the jargon phrases for all this, `` is like desktop publishing three years ago,'' according to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a longtime executive for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who now runs a consulting business in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` This thing is exploding very rapidly,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> said Wednesday, the third day of the huge Comdex computer convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajarin </PERSON>, a strategic planning consultant to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other companies, has compiled the names of 350 people already producing multimedia. Sample uses: worker trainees watch a master repairman in action rather than read a boring manual, a salesman calls up video images of swatches of cloth and suggested configurations of desks and chairs for buyers of office furniture. The recreational possibilities are also amazing, with the potential for home computer users to integrate the functions of stereos, videocassettes and compact disks. The promise of the technology was blasted home to convention-goers Monday by keynote speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON>, senior vice president at ordinarily conservative <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and a pretty fair drummer back in his college days. In a presentation that was more show than speech, <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON> pulled out his drumsticks and started blamming away on synthetic drums as part of an extravagant demonstration of controllable sight and sound. At a touch, <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON> summoned images of swooping eagles, careening roller coasters and bridges that collapsed at whatever speed he chose _ or whatever speed a structural engineer might choose, which was the point he was making. `` Opportunity is everywhere,'' <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON> said, noting that despite the maturing of the computer industry, 90 percent of the businesses in the country are still without computers. Training, education and sales are vast and obvious markets, with applications from the mundane to the sublime. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> of Leader Systems showed off a program that explains the complexities of insurance, with specifics on various plans available at a touch. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> music history professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> uses multimedia to teach <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>: a click of the `` mouse'' controlling his Macintosh produces biographical tidbits; another click might produce a musical theme or additional fragments to show how it's developed. Because desktop computers have become so powerful, they can now hold and manipulate enough information fast enough to produce controllable television images with breathtaking resolution, pictures far sharper than on a conventional TV. That could mean, for example, that images of every picture in the Louvre can be stored for retrieval by art lovers or students who could zoom right in on <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s smile, clear as a bell, experts said at a panel discussion involving officials of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the Amiga. With add-ons to funnel sound, video and text in and combine them with computer-generated graphics and text, multimedia can now be done for perhaps $ 5,000, compared with $ 50,000 just a few years ago, the experts said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Archambault </PERSON>, director of project marketing for Commodore, used an Amiga to generate an impromptu commercial that combined pictures of the computers, music and a swirling, animated company logo. <PERSON> Archambault </PERSON> said that $ 2 billion is spent every year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on computers for education alone. `` We feel multimedia is deliverable to a number of these niche markets today,'' he said.

 Wholesale home heating oil prices fell Wednesday, weighed down by sluggish demand due to unusually warm weather on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Crude oil and gasoline futures prices rose. Contracts for December delivery of No. 2 heating oil declined 0.32 cent to 57.13 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after losing 0.23 cent on Tuesday Later contract months also finished lower. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an energy broker at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the latest production and inventory report from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> showed higher-than-expected heating oil stocks, reflecting slack demand. `` It is going to get cold here one day but there is n't much demand now for heating oil because of the exceptionally warm weather'' in the East, said <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>. Crude oil and gasoline futures held up despite the selling in the heating oil pits. The December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 17 cents to settle at $ 19.67 per 42-gallon barrel after declining 9 cents on Tuesday.

Contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline for December increased 0.30 cent to 50.61 a gallon, recouping some of Tuesday's 0.75-cent drop. Contracts for later delivery also advanced. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said gasoline prices got support from the weekly API report, which was released late Tuesday after trading was done for the day.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is investigating reports of program-trading abuses to determine whether rules were violated during days of hectic trading, exchange officials said Wednesday. The world's largest options marketplace is looking at trading in <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100 stock-index options during the Oct. 13 market plunge as well as on other volatile trading days, said <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> is the fourth major exchange to search for program-trading abuses. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are conducting separate probes of computer-assisted program trading in stocks and stock-index futures. Those three exchanges have tightened surveillance measures and imposed stiff fines after long-term federal scrutiny resulted in numerous indictments and convictions. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> downplayed the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> investigation, saying the exchange has routinely monitored days of heavy trading since 1987. `` We have an ongoing study,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` We also make sure participants in our market behave as they are supposed to.'' Program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks by computer to take advantage of temporary price differences. A stock index option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of a stock index, such as the S & amp; P 100, at a specified price within a specified time. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> is looking at `` sources of volatility,'' including trades _ program or otherwise _ that may have involved manipulation or other forms of rule-breaking, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. For years, the exchange has been the subject of rumors about program-trading abuses _ rumors prompted partly by the complexity of options-related program-trading strategies. Program trading involving stock-index options, commonly called OEX, has also been blamed as a contributor to stock market volatility. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> vice president, pointed to three particular days of heavy trading that are under scrutiny. One was Oct. 13 when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 190.58 points, its second biggest one-day point loss ever. The second was Oct. 16 when the Dow rallied 88.12 points. The third day was Oct. 24, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrials dropped 80 points before rallying to finish the day with a 3.69-point loss. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>'s scrutiny of trading practices may date back to a class-action lawsuit filed against the exchange after the October 1987 stock market crash. A group of more than 1,000 investors contend in the lawsuit that the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> and floor traders responsible for making markets in certain options on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 violated federal law and the exchange's own rules by charging inflated prices for options contracts. In May, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> censured the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> for failing to enforce its own rules on trading manipulation involving stocks and options on <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index. Program trades involving the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 options accounted for 8 percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume between November 1988 and April 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> noted.

<HEAD>Struggling Eastern Airlines Keeps Winter Fares Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is keeping cut-rate fares to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this winter in an effort to bring back passengers, officials said Wednesday. `` What we're really doing is generating revenue,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing. `` We know a lot about <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and how to stimulate travel ... We have an awful lot of seats coming into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this winter. `` The existing fare structure ... is a fare structure that is doing nothing to stimulate travel into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` Our objective obviously is to make money.'' The fares, with relatively few restrictions, are effective immediately for travel between nine <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities and 45 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. They are significant because the airline industry usually boosts winter season fares to vacation points, Eastern officials said. The majority of fliers to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are discretionary, or leisure travelers, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, spurring Eastern to offer incentives to them. A <LOCATION> Miami-to-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fare, based on round-trip purchase, would be $ 99 each way midweek, compared with a current fare of $ 139. In many cases, Eastern is maintaining `` back-in-business'' discount fares aimed at regaining business lost since the airline was hit by a strike on March 4 and entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days later. Passengers must make reservations before Dec. 15 and purchase their tickets _ if space is available _ seven days in advance. The tickets are fully refundable, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Although the fares are part of a winter promotion, reservations can be made for anytime in the future, he said, and will be honored with seven-day advance purchase. The fares require two-night stays, but the nights do n't have to be on a weekend, he said. Blackout dates, on which normal fares apply, are southbound -LRB- into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- Dec. 21-26 and northbound -LRB- out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- Jan. 1-3. A fare structure effective Jan. 6 will continue to offer discounts below industry averages but about $ 20 each way higher than <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bargain fares. Miami-based Eastern is flying 335 flights in and out of the nine <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities: <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. Eastern's announcement came after last week's third-quarter report showed a net loss of $ 185.2 million amid indications the airline has informed its major creditors of a $ 200 million cash shortfall. `` It is used more as a marketing tool to attract attention,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's calculated to create a loss, but it's calculated to regain critical mass, or market share. -LRB- Eastern must -RRB- be particularly active to win people back.'' Eastern officials, trying to rebuild without the unions, have said the airline will emerge from bankruptcy early next year at nearly 90 percent its pre-strike size. Eastern is back to 775 daily flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before the ongoing strike began.

 The dollar ended higher Wednesday in domestic trading against major foreign currencies after declining overseas. Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 391.30 a troy ounce, down $ 2 from late Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 390.90 an ounce, off $ 1.60. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, a vice president and chief dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, attributed the dollar's gains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> partly to `` a small correction from yesterday's selloff ahead of the trade figures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release the merchandise trade figures for September on Thursday, and the market sentiment is that it would show a narrowing of the deficit to between $ 8 billion and $ 9 billion. However, <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said that if the report reveals further economic weakness, particularly by showing a decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, the dollar could head lower. `` The fundamentals are still working against the dollar,'' he said. Several recent economic reports have pointed to an economic slowdown, which spells bad news for dollar investors because it could signal lower interest rates. Lower rates tend to depress a currency. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to 143.37 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen Tuesday. It traded at 143.45 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and rose to 143.795 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 143.05 yen late Tuesday. The British pound traded at $ 1.5810 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, unchanged from late Tuesday's rate. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.5803 from $ 1.5945. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.8390 West German marks, up from 1.8350; 1.6265 Swiss francs, up from 1.6175; 6.2495 French francs, up from 6.2280; 1,351.75 Italian lire, up from 1,343.00; and 1.17095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16975 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.8382 West German marks, down from 1.8540; 1.6220 Swiss francs, down from 1.6380; 6.2420 French francs, down from 6.2925; 2.0790 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0925; 1,348.25 Italian lire, down from 1,357.00; and 1.1726 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1710. Gold bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 391.25 an ounce from $ 390 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to a late bid of $ 391 an ounce from $ 389.

 The stock market snapped out of a brief sinking spell with a rally Wednesday encouraged by declining interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday, rebounded 22.33 points to 2,632.58. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 926 up, 595 down and 465 unchanged. Interest rates fell a bit in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond market Wednesday. Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to the monthly report from the government Thursday on the nation's international trade position Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade deficit of about $ 9 billion, down from $ 10.8 billion in August. Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent weakening trend of corporate earnings. Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments, stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has relaxed its credit policy lately in an evident effort to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy. But some observers have questioned whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> acted early enough or emphatically enough to stave off trouble.

 <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> will have to pay at least part of its overdue interest before foreign banks will consider loaning it more money. `` There is no doubt the banks that hold <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s external debt are concerned'' by the overdue interest, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told a news conference. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is the third biggest debtor nation in the developing world.

 Silver futures prices soared to six-month highs Wednesday while gold and platinum, the recent leaders of the surging precious metals group, fell back. On other commodity markets, pork futures prices rose sharply amid talk of further food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, grains and soybeans were mostly higher and energy futures were mixed. Silver futures settled 13 cents to 15.1 cents higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at $ 5.538 a troy ounce, the highest price for a near-month silver contract since May 12. Gold finished $ 1.90 to $ 2.10 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> with December at $ 392.80 a troy ounce; platinum settled $ 5.20 to $ 5.30 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with January at $ 520.40 a troy ounce. Precious metals prices have risen broadly since Oct. 13, when a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials average triggered a rush of investment dollars to the perceived safety of the metals. But the silver market has lagged behind gold and platinum, possibly because silver is in greater supply. From Oct. 13 through Tuesday, gold prices had risen by 7.5 percent, platinum by 6.9 percent and silver by just 4.9 percent. Silver played catch-up on Wednesday, pushing its gains since Friday the 13th to 7.8 percent. `` I view it as the rubber-band effect,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, senior metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Platinum and gold had already had good moves and investors veiwed silver as too cheap relative to gold.'' Some traders express the silver-gold price relationship in terms of the number of ounces of silver it would take to equal the value of one ounce of gold. A ratio in excess of 70-to-1 is often interpreted by professional traders as a signal to buy silver and sell gold, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. At the close of trading Tuesday, the silver-gold ratio was about 73-to-1, and it approached 74-to-1 early in Wednesday's session At that point, <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said, `` the logical thing was to switch into the silver market.'' Pork futures prices skyrocketed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably would send more food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The government already has committed to send 10,000 metric tons of pork bellies to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as part of a food-aid package. Firm cash markets also supported the pork and cattle markets. Live cattle settled .23 cent to .55 cent higher with December at 74.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .45 cent higher with November at 83.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to 1.37 cents higher with December at 49.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .72 cent to 1.38 cents higher with February at 63.87 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, paced by strength in the wheat market linked to dryness in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat growing areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation of new sales of wheat to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ 50,000 metric tons apiece _ also helped the wheat market, as did a report of frost damage to wheat in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 \ cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.05 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $ 2.39 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.45 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -RCB- cent lower to 4 -RCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.79 -LCB- a bushel Wholesale home heating oil prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, weighed down by sluggish demand due to unusually warm weather on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Crude oil and gasoline futures were mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .08 cent lower to .17 cent higher with December at $ 19.67 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to .61 cent lower with December at 57.13 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher with December at 50.61 cents a gallon.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accepted $ 1.46 million in contributions from lobbyists trying to weaken anti-racketeering laws, consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said Wednesday. The committee on Thursday is to consider a bill changing a provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB-, which permits civil plaintiffs to recover triple damages from white-collar criminals. Public Citizen, a group founded by <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, told a news conference that trade groups representing accountants, savings and loans, securities and commodities firms, banks and insurance companies showered the 14 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel with contributions from 1983 to 1988. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> took particular aim at Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., who accepted $ 213,450 and is the sponsor of the reform bill <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and four other senators have come under fire for meeting with savings and loan regulators on behalf of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a heavy contributor to their campaigns. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is chairman of the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The institution's failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to $ 2 billion. In an attempt to recover some of the loss, regulators have filed a $ 1.1 billion civil RICO suit against <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his associates. `` Now the ringleader of the Keating Five, clearly the most shamelessly shameless of all senators, Sen. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, ... would weaken the very law used by regulators and victims of corporate crime against his friend <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said. `` This has to be the acme of congressional presumption.'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, in a statement, responded that he supported narrowing RICO because it has been misused to target legitimate businesses. His bill specifically permits bank regulators to seek triple damages and would not benefit special interests, he said. The senator said his original bill would have applied to pending lawsuits, such as the one filed against <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, but has been changed so that it affects only suits filed after the legislation passed. A coalition of business, labor and civil liberties groups backing RICO changes issued a statement saying it was `` appalled that Public Citizen would personally attack'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and labeled the news conference `` a last ditch effort to stop a vote on RICO reform legislation.'' <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, woman who lost $ 11,000 in the Lincoln failure, complained at the news conference that <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who conducted a hearing on his bill in June, would not allow her to testify on behalf of fraud victims. Without triple damages in such civil suits, `` wrongdoers will quickly find out that crime _ particularly against defenseless citizens _ pays,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who said her loss included an insurance settement from an automobile accident that left her daughter brain damaged. <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feigin </PERSON>, speaking on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> bill represents `` a concession of colossal proportions'' and `` the emasculation of the single most potent weapon against white-collar crime.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday sought to quell fears about private pension fund fraud, telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the system has `` never been healthier,'' but a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel chairman said there is reason for concern. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, an assistant labor secretary, appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> retirement income subcommittee to dispute warnings from his department's own inspector general's office about the potential for fraud. At the same hearing, the acting inspector general, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, said lax auditing and enforcement have created a `` window of opportunity'' for unscrupulous managers to pilfer Americans' pensions Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement Income and Employment, said the public need not panic but cautioned: `` Ignoring a situation where such large sums of money are subjected to few effective outside investigations, combined with the minor penalties which are often imposed for those who have misused funds, seems to me to be asking for trouble.'' The private pension system holds $ 2 trillion in assets and covers 76 million Americans. Concern about the plans' well-being has been heightened by discovery of several multimillion-dollar pension skimming schemes and financial problems in the government's pension insurance program, which is $ 1.5 billion in the red Following the hearing, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said his is asking the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional investigator, to look into the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of investigations. Ball, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare benefits, said that despite those problems `` the pension system, by any objective measure, has never been healthier.'' In an earlier interview, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> expressed skepticism about such assurances. `` I heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan situation was n't serious five years ago,'' he said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, an outspoken former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, stayed away from dramatic comparisons in his testimony Wednesday, and said `` our goal is not to unnecessarily frighten people, but to stimulate concern where such concern is needed, and to avoid potential future crisis.'' He said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than criminal remedies have `` created a window of opportunity for those who would embezzle and steal from plan participants.'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> also used the forum to air inhouse fighting in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which led to a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opinion in March barring his office from directly investigating private pension plans. That job is handled by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which has 300 inspectors to police the nation's 870,000 private pension programs. Over the past five years, more than 25 percent of the plans audited by the agency had violations of the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. But the <ORGANIZATION> PWBA </ORGANIZATION> on a yearly average investigates less than 1 percent of the nation's pension plans The inspector general's office wants the law changed to require private accountants who audit pension programs to report any violations to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It also says the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should pursue more criminal cases against violators, rather than relying largely on civil suits. Ball responded that the department's enforcement policy is designed to deliver `` the biggest bang for the buck and affecting the most participants possible.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concentrates on plans covering more than 100 employees and targets its investigations `` on plans which we believe have a high chance of violating the law.'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s office, in a report released to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said billions of dollars in private pension money is not being fully audited because the money was invested in such institutions as savings and loans. The assumption was that money in federal institutions was subject to other examinations. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountants </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement received Wednesday, agreed with the inspector general's office, saying: `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should change these regulations to give auditors a fighting chance to do a thorough job. In an earlier study, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s office reported that $ 18.7 million in missed plan assets and administrative violations were found in plans examined in late 1987.

<HEAD>United: Pilots Must Continue to Fly Planes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> says its pilots union is bound by federal law to fly two new jumbo jets, but the pilots say that unless they have a new contract by a Nov. 22 deadline, those planes will be grounded. Lawyers for the company have told the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that its members at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> must continue to fly two new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment on the issue. The planes, purchased last summer, fly from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to the Australian cities of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. Within the next few months, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> plans to acquire a third 747-400 for its <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> route. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots originally refused to fly the planes in a dispute over the size of cockpit crews. They later reversed their position as part of concessions granted during negotiations for a pilot-management buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, and also agreed to fly four extra hours a month without pay. But after the pilot-management group failed to get financing for its $ 6.75 billion buyout proposal on Oct. 13, the pilots threatened to ground the planes on Nov. 22 unless there is sufficient progress toward a revised employee-led buyout, or toward a contract settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots have been working without a contract since April 1988. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive board is scheduled to discuss <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s position on the new jetliners Thursday and Friday, as well as a contract proposal submitted by the company on Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> rejected as `` a piece of trash'' a <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> proposal offered last week _ the first since the buyout effort collapsed. Grounding one of those new planes for a year could reduce <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue by about $ 50 million, industry experts say. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> contends that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the 7,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots, would violate the federal Railway Labor Act by refusing to fly the planes, Ms. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s taking the position that although it chose not to argue the point last summer, our not flying the 747-400s is illegal,'' she said. `` We say that there's no language in our existing contract for 747-400 flying.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said she did not know what provision in the federal law would be applicable to the pilots union. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the law _ used in negotiating airline industry contracts _ generally requires pilots to abide by terms of their contracts, which commonly specify the types of planes they will fly. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> might argue that the 747-400 is a derivative of an existing plane that is covered in the pilots' contract, said the official, who asked that he not be identified by name. But he said the airline would have to go to court to determine whether the law's provisions apply to the new planes. Such an action would be sure to damage the improved relationship between <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management and pilots that resulted from participation in the failed buyout bid.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dresser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil services company, said Wednesday it has offered to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of oil and gas drilling equipment, in a deal valued at $ 567 million. <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON> said the acquisition would broaden its base and prepare the company for resurgence in the petroleum business. `` This is a recognition that the bust is behind us and we're going to move,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dresser </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> Dresser has offered $ 14.25 in cash plus a warrant for each of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s 32.4 million shares, or about $ 462 million. In addition, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON> would assume about $ 106 million in SMith's debt, boosting the total value of the deal to about $ 568 million. The board of directors of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has approved the merger. Dresser's board will consider the merger Thursday. The deal is contingent upon approval by a majority of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> stockholders and clearance by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON> also can terminate the agreement by Friday if fails to reach agreement with Industrial Equity -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's largest shareholder with 33.2 percent of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s outstanding common stock Industrial Equity, controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brierley </PERSON>, put the company in play this summer when it made a bid to buy the stock it did not own. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said Industrial Equity had been involved in the negotiations with <PERSON> Dresser </PERSON> and is expected to approve the merger. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, which moved its headquarters to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> earlier this year, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 31, 1987. The company had filed for bankruptcy after <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 214 million patent infringement suit surrounding the oil drill bit designed by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' father that opened up the petroleum industry. Dresser, based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has become a supplier mainly to the refining and marketing end of the energy business, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. The Smith purchase would take advantage of the rejuvenating exploration business, especially for natural gas, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. In Dresser's latest fiscal year, the company earned $ 145.5 million on sales of $ 3.94 billion. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has continued to post losses since emerging from bankruptcy. For the first nine months of this year, the company lost $ 2.05 million, or 12 cents per share, on sales of $ 223.7 million. Last year, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s losses were $ 23.38 million, or 86 cents per share, on sales of $ 320.8 million.

<HEAD>Lengthy Strike Could Hurt Economy, Federal Reserve Bank Warns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drawn-out machinists strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could hurt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, since <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's third-largest exporter, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> says The strike enters its 44th day Thursday. Federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said no new negotiations were scheduled. In the November issue of its newsletter The Western Economy, the bank said the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike is starting to affect the Seattle-area economy, with suppliers seeing some reductions in orders. `` Personal income is estimated to have fallen by $ 25 to $ 30 million during each week of the strike, and weekly income losses are expected to grow as the strike continues,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> ships nearly $ 1 billion in goods overseas each month, the newsletter said. With fewer deliveries, `` the stoppage could show up in worse <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for the duration of the strike and beyond,'' it said. On Wednesday, the government cited the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake as two reasons why industrial production fell 0.7 percent in October to its lowest level in 3 -LCB- years. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index in October stood at 141.4 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent a month earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog of 1,718 airplanes, worth an estimated $ 85 billion, with deliveries of some aircraft booked well into the late 1990s. Since the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has delivered 21 jets. When the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had planned to deliver about 93 more planes by the end of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathrop </PERSON> said production is continuing `` to the best of our ability and available resources.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> production workers nationwide, went on strike Oct. 4, the day after members rejected a three-year contract offer. Union negotiators later turned down a revised offer, calling it a worse deal than the earlier proposal.
