 A man who fled the shooting of his wife crashed his car, took over two other vehicles at gunpoint and left an abducted family beside a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> highway before surrendering Friday, police said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, 39, was wanted for the Thursday night shooting of his estranged wife, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, 34. She was in critical condition Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said a nursing superviser. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> turned himself in to <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> police about 5 p.m. Friday and was arrested on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and unlawful possession of a weapon, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> was held in the city jail pending arraignment Saturday. Police said the shooting began an interstate trek across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a manhunt that involved police from <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> shot his wife several times about 10:15 p.m. Thursday and fled in his own car only to get into an accident with other cars a few blocks away. Witnesses told police <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> pulled a revolver and forced <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> to drive him to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> dropped <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> off near the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, police said. There, <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> approached a car stopped at a pay phone and forced five members of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> family to drive him to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said Officer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Swinney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police spokeswoman. A male family member was at a pay phone when <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> allegedly forced him back into the car and made them drive to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` I thought he was going to kill us for sure,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, whose husband, daughter, son, and grandson were held at gunpoint during the two-hour ordeal. `` We started to pray out loud as soon as he got into the car,'' Mrs. Gee said. `` He told us to shut up.'' The gunman forced the family, which was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to attend a funeral service, out of the car on the Long Island Expressway near <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Perrone </PERSON> said there were no reports of injuries to the family or <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> then fled on foot. He contacted his relatives while on the run and was talked into giving himself up, <PERSON> Perrone </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>EPA Urges Conservation Measures for Cars, Homes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Conservation techniques that were urged during the energy shortages of the 70s should be adopted to combat global warming caused by pollution, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in a report Friday, outlined actions such as development of fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving homes and solar technology, needed by the end of the century to curtail global warming. They say such warming will occur unless air pollution is reduced. In its report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on environmental protection, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said most scientists agree that without action to reduce pollution, the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> can be expected to warm by 4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years. `` There's no doubt there is a consensus that the greenhouse phenomenon is very real,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., the subcommittee chairman after hearing <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> summarize the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report Scientists believe that a variety of pollutants are causing a `` greenhouse effect'' that traps the sun's infrared radiation, instead of allowing it to go back into space, resulting in increased warming. The gases most responsible for the warming are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report said `` no single technology or policy can have significant impact in mitigating the accumulation of greenhouse gases'' because of their wide use. Instead, it said, that only by dealing with the problem broadly can there be significant reductions. The recommendations outlined in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report will be used by both the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to assess what kinds of regulatory action or legislation might be needed on global warming. One focus, the agency said, must be aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels, which produce carbon dioxide, by far the largest single contributor to global warming. Last decade, the high cost of such fuels and the easy shutoff of foreign sources prompted conservation moves. To curtail energy use, the report proposed: _ Increasing average automobile fuel economy levels to 40 miles per gallon by the year 2000 This is in sharp contrast to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which in recent years has urged elimination of federal fuel economy standards and accommodated auto industry requests not to set fleetwide standards above 26.5 mpg. _ Taking measures to make new single family homes more energy efficient so that on average they will use 50 percent less fuel heat in the year 2000 than the average in 1980 _ Setting fees of 7 percent to 20 percent on carbon emissions from natural gas, oil and coal to encourage less use of those fossil fuels The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also suggested increasing research into solar technology so it competes with oil and gas and pushing to get all industrial countries to require catalytic converters similar to those required in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobiles. But the report emphasized that increased energy efficiency will not in itself provide the total answer. It said efforts must be made to: _ Stop the loss of forests around the world by beginning in 1990 a program aimed at planting at least as many trees as are cut down or destroyed Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, keeping the gas from getting into the atmosphere. _ End the use of chlorofluorocarbons by all industrialized countries over the next 14 years and take action to sharply curtail the chemical's use by developing countries The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries recently agreed to phase out use of such gases, which contribute to depletion of the world's ozone layer and are believed to be a major contributor to global warming.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is denying an accusation that it indirectly sent messages to national drug director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> threatening his political future. `` The allegations are absolutely ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>. An administration source said Friday that the warnings to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> through third parties threaten that `` if he has thoughts of a political future, he can forget them if he does n't respect the power of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for elected office. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is `` very angry at the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'' and that while he's `` not looking for a fight with the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, he wo n't walk away from it'' and may battle them in public if need be. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Friday through spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>: `` There have been a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.'' The issue arose Tuesday when, at <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s urging, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> immediately suspended import permits for more than 110,000 assault-style rifles such as the semiautomatic versions of AK-47s and Uzi carbines. <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> subsequently decided on its own to suspend sales of its AR-15, the most popular U.S.-made semiautomatic assault rifle. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> a week earlier to develop a policy on the rifles. Calls for a ban have been prompted by scores of drug-related shootings and the recent killing of five <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schoolchildren by a man wielding such a weapon. Publicly, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has reacted calmly to the decision, saying it would relieve the `` media hysteria'' over the guns and `` should provide an atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue.'' But privately, the source alleged, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has been relaying warnings via `` private people'' who are not in government. During an interview earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he believed most members of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> do not support an `` anything goes'' attitude toward gun ownership and said he had spoken with friends of his who are hunters. `` These people have no use or interest in assault rifles,'' he said. `` The ` anything goes' idea _ let's just get our hands on any kind of weapon _ I think that's a view of the world that's not shared by most Americans, by most members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and I think an awful lot of people out there are concerned about the kind of firepower that we're seeing used in our streets,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he was not surprised that sales of semiautomatic assault rifles have taken off since the import suspension and <PERSON> Colt </PERSON>'s action this week, but, he said: `` If people are doing this because they think that this could mean the end of guns, that no more guns would be available, then they're mistaken `` The tradition in this country of a law-abiding citizen having guns, using them for lawful purposes, teaching their kids how to hunt, target shooting, is as old as this republic itself, and it's not something anybody wants to disturb. Echoing the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s words, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said: `` Everybody knows ultimately the problem is n't the gun, the problem is the gun in the wrong hands. `` But it seems to me reasonable measures can be found and taken in this effort which do n't deprive or interfere with that good and decent practice of people enjoying their firearms in lawful ways and yet respond and speak appropriately to this escalation, this arms race in the cities that police have spoken about so eloquently. Clearly there's a large middle ground there.''

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> congressman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was sworn in as the nation's 17th secretary of defense after a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> endorsement that one Republican complained may have been too swift. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation Friday on a 92-0 vote, just one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave him its unanimous blessing. Shortly after Friday's vote, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> resigned as <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s sole congressmen and then was sworn in as defense chief during a private ceremony in his Capitol Hill office. A large, formal oath-taking ceremony was scheduled for next Tuesday. Later in the afternoon Friday, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> traveled to his new Pentagon office where he met with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> executive who has been nominated to become deputy defense secretary, and with several <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration holdovers for briefings. Officials said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> would probably work at least part of the weekend trying to get settled in. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s elevation to the defense post finally completed formation of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet, a process slowed by the bruising fight over the president's first choice for <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. Tower was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 53-47, on March 9 after weeks of controversy over his personal life, drinking habits and consulting work for large defense contractors. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was sworn into office by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, director of administration and management in the office of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Present were his wife, <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON>, their two daughters, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, and his parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marge </PERSON>. `` I am proud to have the opportunity to serve the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the nation as secretary of defense,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` But at the same time, I will miss the House. And more than anything, I regret that I must step down after representing the state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> for 10 years.'' The rancor surrounding the Tower nomination was largely absent when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> moved quickly this week on <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, although some bitterness remained. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., complained the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had `` rushed to judgment'' on <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> after the dispute over Tower and with a two-week recess looming `` There's hardly been a chance for people to find out about Congressman <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s nomination in the press, media, to sit down and write a letter and have it delivered,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. `` I think we're correct and I'm prepared to vote for Congressman <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, but I do think this timetable ought not set a precedent.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, top Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, denied <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was put on a fast track, noting that because he was a congressman, his financial records were already on file. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> expedited its background check. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee chairman, later responded more pointedly, saying: `` I gather what he -LRB- Specter -RRB- wanted us to do was to wait for the rumor and innuendo to come in. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> led the fight to kill the Tower nomination and came under harsh criticism for his handling of the proceedings. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat used his time on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to defend the committee's process <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said he and Sen. <PERSON> Malcom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, both Republicans, felt a mixture of pride and sadness because their state's congressional delegation was losing a man of `` distinction and honor and rare political savvy.'' A special election will be held in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to fill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat vacated by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. Senators not present for the vote on <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> were <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt.; <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON>

 An 11-year-old girl who confessed killing her 2-year-old half-brother and trying to kill her 15-month-old half-sister apparently resented caring for them, police said. `` Apparently the mother had to work a lot of double shifts and -LRB- the 11-year-old -RRB- was in charge of feeding the baby, clothing them, taking care of them as an adult would and she's only 11 years old,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wierzbicki </PERSON>. `` We worked with a lot of investigators on this case, and no one can remember a person that young committing such a crime,'' he added. The girl, whose name was not disclosed because of her age, was being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on one count of first-degree murder and one of attempted first-degree murder, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> figures show three children younger than 10 were arrested in 1986 for murder.

<TEXT>
 Twenty-one senators have lined up against their steel-state colleagues and called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to end steel import quotas covering 19 nations and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The senators said in a letter Friday to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the restraints have driven up steel prices and caused product shortages. They said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needed `` a sensible steel policy'' that considered not just steelmakers, but other producers, too. The senators, 18 of them <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, face stiff opposition. Fifty-five other senators, many of them from steel-producing states, have signed onto a bill empowering the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to extend the import curbs beyond their Sept. 30 expiration. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year, product-by-product `` voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Three days before last November's election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to continue the restraints in some form. But with the steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs _ led by a coalition of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers _ believe they can make a case for ending the program, or at least narrowing its scope. Manufacturers of home appliances, construction and farm machinery, industrial equipment, auto parts and other products all rely on steel as a raw material, said the letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` In the experience of many of these manufacturers, steel voluntary restraint agreements have caused higher prices and shortages of some steel products, and are undermining their ability to compete in international markets,'' the letter said. `` It is important that steel trade be considered from the perspective of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, not just the steel industry alone,'' it said. The senators invited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to end the `` burden'' of the quotas. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., a leading advocate of continued restraints, said through a spokesman Friday that the conditions that compelled steel firms to seek government aid in 1984 remain `` There are still some senators who keep their heads in the sand when it comes to the fact that countries have not discontinued their unfair trading practices of dumping and subsidies,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryers </PERSON>, legislative director for <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>. Signing the letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were Sens. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>,; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan.; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis.; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif

<HEAD>Bills Aiding Striking Eastern Workers Bogged Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s striking unions are shrugging off their inability to prompt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to quickly produce legislation aimed at helping the thousands of picketers. The two bills that the carrier's workers are pinning their hopes on both bogged down on Friday _ at least temporarily _ as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began its two-week Easter recess. Union leaders said the delay would not be overly harmful to strikers, who began their third week of picketing today. Labor leaders said they are relying more heavily on two other strategies: working in the bankruptcy courts, and seeking a buyer for the grounded airline. `` We never indicated to any of our members that these bills were a panacea, they would be passed quickly, or anything like that,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` We told our pilots up front that things in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would go quickly but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be an uphill fight,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Eastern strike began when the airline's 8,500 machinists walked off their jobs in a wage and benefit dispute and were followed by the carrier's pilots and flight attendants. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats scheduled a vote for April 5 _ the chamber's second post-Easter day of business _ on whether to allow consideration of a bill that would hand the government a role in ending the walkout Republicans have so far blocked action on the measure, which would compel President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to name a special board to recommend a way to end the strike. At the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, voiced opposition to a measure that would up the ante for management. The bill, introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, would allow <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors access to the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern filed for protection from its creditors under the federal bankruptcy code on March 9. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s associate general counsel, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiden </PERSON>, told the panel that the bill would be `` unfair, oppressive and unconstitutional'' and would have dangerous repercussions throughout the airline industry. `` In the future, no corporation could or would consider acquiring a troubled airline, or starting a new airline ... because the risk of failing could not be confined to the new venture itself,'' <PERSON> Seiden </PERSON> told the senators. Both bills are considered long shots for enactment into law. Administration officials have threatened a veto of the emergency board bill. The bankruptcy revision measure has been questioned by several lawmakers, including Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the judiciary panel, who said Friday that he wants to study how the proposal would effect other airlines Union leaders and their <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> supporters have sought action on the bills anyway, arguing that their efforts would at the very least be good for strikers' morale.

<HEAD>Study Says Loss of Oil Imports Would Cause no Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy system could handling a sudden and sustained loss of oil imports without suffering shortages of gasoline and other refined oil products, although prices might jump, a government-sponsored study has concluded. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an advisory group to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the key to managing an import cutoff is quick action by the government to tap into the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s underground oil stocks. In the event of a loss of oil imports equal to 3 million barrels a day _ representing about 40 percent of last year's average import rate _ the strategic reserves in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could be used to meet most of the shortfall, according to a draft of the study provided Friday to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The study assumed the imported oil would be cut off for three months. The strategic reserves currently hold about 555 million barrels of crude oil. The system was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargo that year. The study made no firm predictions about price increases resulting from a supply emergency, but <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtblau </PERSON>, a private energy expert who helped compile the draft report, said in an interview that prices would be expected to rise sharply even if the oil transport system succeeded in averting shortages. `` The possibility of a price explosion as an instant reaction in such a volatile situation is highly likely,'' said <PERSON> Lichtblau </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. He said it was impossible to predict how high prices would go. Energy industry officials and many on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have voiced increasing alarm in recent weeks at a trend toward rapidly growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil. Imports last year equaled 42 percent of supply, up from 31 percent in 1985. This trend is linked to a drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil output and rising consumption. The concern has fueled an oil industry drive to win congressional approval to drill for oil in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and off the shores of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where prospects for discoveries are considered good. Some energy executives also have cited the import trend as a reason for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve an import fee on oil and for providing new tax breaks for oil drillers. The study on how the nation's oil transportation system would respond to supply emergencies was requested by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> in February 1987 while he was energy secretary. Final conclusions are to be presented to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in mid-April, said <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, a petroleum council spokeswoman. The draft report cites three main reasons why even a severe disruption of oil supplies would not cause a shortage of petroleum products: the large amounts of oil in transit on ocean tankers, barges and in pipelines; a more flexible and efficient oil refining and transport system; and the availability of strategic reserves. The study also said the energy system could cope with a shutdown of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System for 30 days without causing shortages of gasoline or other products. The pipeline carries oil from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> for shipment to the lower 48 states, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators say they'll keep $ 8,000 in campaign contributions from an imported-car dealers' group, even though both complained the organization is a foreign agent forbidden to make such payments. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> gave $ 5,000 to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and $ 3,000 to Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> last year, it also spent nearly $ 1 million to defeat them and Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nev </LOCATION>. Those three senators, along with Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., signed a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asking it to investigate whether the PAC ought to be registered as a foreign If the organization were found to be a foreign agent operating with foreign funds, spending that money to influence an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> election would be illegal. Nevertheless, neither <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> plan to give the money back unless the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tells them to do so, their spokesmen said. `` I mean these guys are hypocrites,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemet </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` They asked us for money to support them.'' <PERSON> Nemet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Glacken </PERSON>, the imported-auto dealer <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, deny they're working for foreigners. The PAC spent nearly $ 2.6 million last year on <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> elections. Of that total, about 83 percent was spent to help Republican candidates, according to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nemet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glacken </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from their office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> are trying to get even because the group spent large amounts of money against them. <PERSON> Nemet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glacken </PERSON> said the organization's funding comes entirely from American citizens. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, acknowledged that <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was `` not thrilled'' that the PAC spent more than half a million dollars against him. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, said the Senator would wait to see what the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decides. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Varoga </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, said only that the senator does not plan to give back any money. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, who has neither been opposed by nor accepted money from the group, signed the letter because his colleagues asked him to and because he is opposed to the role political action committees in general are playing in American politics, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeken </PERSON>. Under federal law, individuals or firms representing foreign governments, people or companies have to register with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as foreign agents and report what activities they have carried out for their clients. While foreign agents could still give money to political campaigns as individual <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, the law does not permit them to make such contributions in their role as foreign agents. The PAC also paid out big money to help <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. All three of those Republicans won their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> elections. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> had $ 319,126 spent on his behalf by the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> received a $ 10,000 contribution and had another $ 326,050 spent for him, and Wallop got a $ 4,000 contribution with $ 88,862 spent on his behalf, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. The PAC also spent money independently on two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races, and the beneficiaries there were Democrats. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> had $ 80,000 spent independently for him, and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> got $ 45,000 spent independently on his behalf.

 The Pavia tower toppled, the Tower of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> is leaning further than ever and dozens of other artworks have been shrouded in scaffolding or turned over to restorers. Modern day damage from traffic and pollution and simple old age are exacting a heavy toll on some of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most famous monuments. The collapse on Friday of the 255-foot medieval tower in the northern city of <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION> was one of the most dramatic blows to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s historic patrimony since a bell tower in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> toppled 87 years ago But experts say is it symptomatic of the problems afflicting art works in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` There has been inadequate regular maintenance and we have reached the absurd, where if an -LRB- art -RRB- superintendent wants to send a letter he's forced to pay for the stamps,'' <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Piacenti </PERSON>, head of the art section of the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a convention on protecting artworks in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> Friday. He commented after word of the Pavia collapse reached the experts. Two people were killed and 15 injured when the tower collapsed in <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION>, a city founded in 568 by the Longobards, a Germanic tribe, and later home of the Lombard rulers. The tower was 900 years old and possibly suffered damage from heavy rains last August. The architect in charge of monument preservation, however, said the cause was probably the natural decay of the mortar cementing the bricks. `` It's something due to age, which can not be predicted. It's typical of ancient towers,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonietta </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrate </PERSON> `` It also happened to the bell tower of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>.'' In 1902, the 1,000-year-old St. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> toppled without warning. A worldwide subscription raised money to build an exact reproduction, which was completed in 1912. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most famous tower, the Leaning Tower of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>, has been judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate future. The 800-year-old tower continued to increase its lean last year, according to the annual report recently issued by the group charged with preservation of the marble monument. But <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON>, head of the group, said he expected it to stand for as long as another two centuries at its current rate of lean. `` The tower is closely watched, very closely watched,'' said <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> in a telephone interview. `` Just because one tower falls does n't mean another will.'' The 180-foot marble monument, begun in 1173, began to lean when it was only 34 feet high when the soil underneath it began to give way. Experts have been studying projects to support the tower, while keeping its famous tilt, but no work has begun yet. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> is the depository of some of the world's greatest artworks but has also had to battle some of the biggest problems caused by the exhaust fumes and the rumbles from the 1.8 million cars in the Italian capital. Experts recently reunited <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Aurelius </PERSON> with his horse after an 8-year-long restoration project but have n't decided yet whether to risk new damage by returning it to its place on the Campidoglio Square. The Trevi Fountain sits behind plexiglass, with its waters turned off, as it undergoes cleaning and restoration. But over the past year, other monuments and columns have been reappearing from behind scaffolding as restoration work is completed.

<HEAD>Chilean Fruit to Return to Market under Tougher Inspections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chilean fruit could be back in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores next week under an intensified inspection plan designed to assure the safety of the produce after traces of cyanide were found in two grapes last week. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration cleared the way Friday for new shipments of Chilean fruit with announcement of an inspection plan that officials said will provide `` maximum feasible safety'' of the fruit and end a week-long health scare. Under the plan, fruit held by importers, wholesalers and retailers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` that can not be practically inspected'' will be destroyed, while fruit at the docks, on ships or awaiting export in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> will be subjected to heightened inspections, officials said. `` This is a plan that deals with safety and what is maximumly feasible,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Responsibility to see that fruit already in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is destroyed lies with state health departments, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Neither <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> nor representatives of Chilean exporters could give figures on the value of the fruit to be destroyed. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said questions about who would bear the cost of the lost fruit are also not his to consider. `` I've got to look at safety, I've got to look at the scientific data and I ca n't allow economics or politics to move into those decisions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioner said. A third poisoning threat was telephoned to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Friday, sometime before the plan was announced in the early afternoon Friday, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said officials believe the caller may have been the same Spanish-speaking man who made the two earlier threats that prompted the inspections that found the tainted grapes. But, he said, the latest threat raises no more or less concern than the first two. `` We designed this thing with -LRB- the probability of more -RRB- threats in mind,'' he said. About 5 percent of Chilean fruit at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> docks or in transit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be visually inspected, and all suspicious-looking fruit will be subjected to laboratory tests before it is released for sale. In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, fruit to be exported will be subject to increased security, inspections and lab tests. The Chilean government and exporters will be responsible for the program there, but an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> team will be sent to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> soon to assist and observe their procedures, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He said the plan is `` based on the assumptions of the type of sampling that would be required to have a high confidence of detecting anything if something is there.'' `` It is impossible to assure 100 percent safety,'' without checking every piece of fruit, he said. Chilean grapes, which make up the bulk of grapes on sale this time of year, and other fruit could be back on the shelves of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores in five to nine days, he said. Young said grapes _ which constitute about 70 percent of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries will be the first fruit released because cyanide contamination of them is the easiest to spot since the fruit discolors quickly and becomes mushy But, he cautioned, that `` consumers should inspect all products, regardless of country of origin.'' He said buyers should look for needle marks, any unusual appearance or discoloration or a chemical or ` burned almond' smell. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he could not estimate the time for return of the other Chilean fruit exports, including melons, cantaloupes, pears, apples, nectarines, plums and peaches. These larger fruits, if injected with cyanide, could carry higher levels of the poison than the smaller fruits can. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the inspections of 13,000 crates of fruit since small amounts of cyanide were found in two seedless red grapes last weekend turned up no additional evidence of contamination. After the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> plan was unveiled, the military government in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> announced a package of economic measures to counter the extensive damage to the Chilean fruit industry. Chilean Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, who met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday with Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, called the plan a `` workable solution.''

 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> says he is sending top aides to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this weekend to look into the safety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and new allegations about warnings of terrorist attack before the bombing of Flight 103. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Friday his action was prompted by a meeting with relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21 disaster over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and by the controversy erupting in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> over specific threats before the bombing. In addition to dispatching members of his personal staff, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he planned to visit <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> himself next month in an effort to get a united approach to the threat of sky terrorism and find out more about the bombing and the warnings. The secretary said in a speech that his meeting with relatives of some of the people killed in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> explosion convinced him he must get directly involved in issues surrounding the bombing. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the relatives introduced themselves one by one, using the names of loved ones killed in the crash. `` It was one of the most moving meetings I think I have ever had ... You were literally speechless,'' he said. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, a victim's relative who attended the meeting, praised <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> for meeting with about 20 families but said he is angry that the government has done so little to prevent further terrorist attacks or warn passengers. He said neither former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nor President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sent even a note of condolence to any of the families, while at least two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> victims' families received sympathy notes from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` If we'd won the Super Bowl, we'd have been in the Rose Garden. But if you get people blown out of the air, that's not important enough,'' said <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, whose brother was killed in the bombing. A group of Flight 103 victims' relatives proposes that the government set up a telephone number passengers can call to see if there are threats against a flight they are planning to take. Officials in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> disclosed that a bomb warning, including a photograph of a radio-cassette bomb of the type investigators believe was used, was dated two days before the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 747 was destroyed but did not reach the airlines until several days later. Both British authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had described such a bomb in security warnings a month earlier, airline and government officials said. The West German intelligence agency said it sent a memo about the possibility of such a bomb to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines even earlier, on Nov. 10. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he was trying to get more details on the warning and how they were handled. `` Let me tell you I do n't know everything,'' he said. `` Yesterday I learned some things for the first time, and I think the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> did, about some disclosures in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as well as some possible disclosures to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> airlines.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> transportation subcommittee, introduced a resolution urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint a commission to investigate the bombing. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> specifically warned that the explosive device might evade detection by X-ray machines,'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speech. `` We need to know what <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and other airlines did, if anything, in response to these warnings.'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> attempted to get floor passage of his resolution, but Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the deputy Republican leader, said it should go through the committee hearing process first.

 A lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> challenging an emergency curfew for teen-agers in the nation's capital shows the organization has lost touch with the reality of drugs and violence, Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> commented Friday after the local <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> chapter asked a federal court to declare the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s 90-day law unconstitutional and issue an injunction blocking enforcement. Backers say the law is intended to help fight drugs in the nation's capital by keeping people under 18 off city streets late at night and early in the morning and thus away from the often violent open-air drug markets. The class-action suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the parents of five teen-agers, a 12-year-old boy and three other people, says the curfew violates constitutional protection of freedom of speech and association. The law also is flawed because it forces young adults to carry adequate identification and display it to police on request, and discriminates `` irrationally'' between people under and over age 18. But <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> countered: `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyers do n't live in these neighborhoods where you ca n't sleep at night because gunshots, killings are going on. They do n't live in communities where drugs are being used or sold. They're out of touch with reality.'' The emergency law went into effect Thursday. Enforcement will start on Monday, the mayor said. The measure generally requires people under age 18 to be off the streets by 11 p.m. during the week and by midnight on weekends. The curfew ends daily at 6 a.m. The suit said one of the plaintiffs is a 17-year-old girl, <PERSON> Simbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, an actress attending art school who would need to be out after midnight if she gets the part in a play for which she is now auditioning. Another plaintiff, 17-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dranitzke </PERSON>, is a student council president who attends senior class dinners at night about twice a month and who says the senior prom this spring will last well past midnight.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> demanded Friday that its chairman apologize for his actions on an Indian reservation in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> last month, according to a published report. The chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, went to the White Mountain Apache Reservation on Feb. 7 to look into a custody dispute involving a 14-year-old girl. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a psychologist and a television crew interviewed the girl, outraging tribal authorities who called the incident an invasion of sovereignty. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Saturday editions that the commission rebuked <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> during a closed meeting Friday, and ordered him to write letters of apology to all involved. One member of the commission who attended the meeting said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> acknowledged he had exercised bad judgment, The Times reported. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> has said he went to the reservation because he wanted first-hand knowledge of whether the girl, <PERSON> Lalita </PERSON> <PERSON> Altaha </PERSON>, had had a chance to express her own wishes in the custody dispute. The girl was adopted as an infant by a white couple, <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Normand </PERSON> <PERSON> Desrochers </PERSON>, but last year a court ordered that she be returned to her natural mother, <PERSON> Thurza </PERSON> <PERSON> Altaha </PERSON>, who lives on the White Mountain reservation. According to The Times' account, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> learned of the case from psychologist <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON>, who is a consultant to the commission and who also had advised the <PERSON> Desrochers </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told the commission he went to the reservation with Goodfield, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals and a camera crew which was making a documentary on Indian adoption cases. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told the commissioners that they approached a school bus on which <PERSON> Lalita </PERSON> was riding and asked for her, and that she agreed to speak with them. They spoke with the girl for about 30 minutes, then drove her in <LOCATION> Goodfield </LOCATION>'s car to her home, where they had a `` tense'' exchange with Mrs. <PERSON> Altaha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON> and the others were driving away from the reservation, they were stopped by <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies at the request of tribal police and deteined for questioning. They were released four or five hours later, said Sheriff <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. Tribal chairman <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> later called the incident `` an incursion that ... clearly violates the sovereignity'' of the tribe. At the commission's meeting Friday, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> defended his actions as an attempt to determine how tribal courts handle custody cases. The commission then went into private session and demanded he write letters of apology indicating that his activities were not approved by the commission or condoned by its members, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 The Enola Gay, the steel-gray bomber that effectively ended World War II, today sits in a warehouse without wings or engines, belying its fame as the B-29 that carried the first atomic weapon. Restoration experts are taking the plane apart bolt by bolt in a nine-year project to turn the grimy aircraft into a shiny relic for the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum. When the plane is displayed in 1994, the exhibit likely will renew debate about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s use of the atomic bomb. It was early in the morning on Aug. 6, 1945, when the first atomic bomb was released over <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, killing and injuring 160,000 people. A second bomb was later dropped over <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. `` Any time you even bring up the name Enola Gay it rekindles debate,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, a navigator on the historic mission. `` I guess the discussion is always going to be around. It's been 40 some years and there still is n't any conclusion. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, now 68, saw the plane in 1985 when rehabilitation work began at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He retired three years ago from <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> and lives in <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Enola Gay's 98-foot-long body sits severed in half at the warehouse. The two pieces sit side by side with various other historical planes and spacecraft. `` We have some -LRB- visitors -RRB- who tell us that this plane saved their life or their uncle's life because it ended the war,'' shop foreman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> said recently. It took nearly three years for <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> to restore the front section. Earlier this year, technicians began work on the rear section and wings of the plane, which Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbets </PERSON> named after his mother. Each part is dipped, sprayed or painted with preservatives and waxes, <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> said. Using photographs, old technical manuals and history books as their guides, the restoration experts plan to remove all markings and decals that were not on the plane the day after the mission. The names and dates of scores of unknown people will be buffed from the plane's aluminum exterior. `` There's lots of graffiti,'' <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> said. `` Most of it was ` Joe Blow 1950' _ that kind of thing.'' <PERSON> Tibbets </PERSON>' name will be repainted in stenciled military lettering instead of the script-style print added sometime after the flight. `` Enola Gay'' was painted in black, block letters under a cockpit window just hours before the mission. The name will remain, but extra brush strokes on the `` E'' and `` G,'' from a touch-up paint job done later, will be removed, <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> said. During the restoration work, <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> found a chisel that had been lost inside the plane when it was being manufactured. They also found an atomic bomb arming pin behind the radio operator's table. The pin apparently was an extra not used on the weapon. A replica of the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> bomb sits in front of the plane. `` There's no evidence of the blast whatsoever -LRB- on the plane -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Horigan </PERSON> said. `` I think they were 10 to 15 miles away when the blast went off.'' After the war, in November 1945, the plane was modified. It returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1946 and went into storage for three years in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, then was ferried by <PERSON> Tibbets </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a storage site for the Smithsonian. It made its last flight Dec. 2, 1953, when it was flown to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.

The petition drive was launched in this northwest <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> city because residents have shown concern at the slow progress of the crash investigation, the families said. `` Terrorism and tragedy such as this have never touched this community before,'' said Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the first to sign the petition. The drive was organized by <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrend </PERSON>, who was among the 1,000 mourners at the church service for <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student on her way home from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for Christmas when the plane blew up. `` I'd like to see an outcry from the people so loud that the government ca n't forget this,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in his first statement since the death of his 23-year-old daughter. The petitions will be distributed throughout the Northeast. Organizers said they hope to get 20,000 signatures by the time they stage a vigil outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on April 3. Ms. <PERSON> Primeau </PERSON> and other family members said they suspect the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> knew about the bomb threats but that it remained on the sidelines before and after the crash. `` We're not an investigatory agency,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Friday. `` British authorities are investigating the crash and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is assisting them.'' `` The investigation is a very lengthy, complicated process. And it's frustrating, which is very difficult for the families. It's understandable,'' she added `` I wish there was something we could do to make things come together more quickly.'' Ms. <PERSON> Primeau </PERSON> said the anger of the families was heightened Friday by a British newspaper report that authorities knew who had bombed the flight. The report from the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed by investigators, has increased their suspicion that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is withholding information about the bombing, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it had been warned by the West German government Nov. 10 about the kind of radio-cassette player bomb involved. Politicians of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> with bungling a warning dated two days before the disaster but not mailed until several days later.

 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has sold its one-millionth copy of its all-time bestseller, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' the publisher announced Written in 1940, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s masterpiece was first performed on Broadway and published by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1956, three years after the playwright's death. It was <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s fourth play to win a Pulitzer Prize. The first paperback version of the work appeared in 1962. Sale of the millionth copy of the play, which happened last month, came shortly after the conclusion of the 1988 centennial celebration of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s birth. This fall, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> will publish a corrected version of the play restoring previously missing lines of dialogue and stage direction. Recent scholarship on the play uncovered several errors of omission that occurred when the playwright's wife, <PERSON> Carlotta </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, retyped a heavily edited version of his manuscript. The changes in the 61st reprinting are `` meaningful, if not plentiful,'' said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> press publicist.

 Nearly 2 million people cheered the first woman grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, while in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> the `` Ladies of the Knights'' protested their exclusion from an all-male affair. The wearin' of the green was prevalent throughout the country as the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the Empire State Building and the palms, fountains and grits in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, all shone with the color of the day. The celebrations in honor of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s patron saint continued today, with parades in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We've got to stop meeting like this,'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> as she kissed him before taking the historic first step that kicked off the nation's oldest and largest parade. `` I'm the grand marshal and I'm walking on air,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON>, 66. She was followed by regiments of police and firefighters in tam-o' - shanters and marching bands in busbies playing bagpipes, fifes In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, four members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> staged a satirical protest outside the annual all-male dinner held by the Knights of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>. Wearing horn-rimmed glasses and outdated clothes, the women waved handkerchiefs and yelled `` Oh Boys, Boys'' in mock high-pitched voices as they acted as a tongue-in-cheek welcoming committee for the Knights, who said the traditional event was just an evening of camaraderie. An estimated 400,000 people lined the downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> parade route in a light rain that began shortly after the march began. Forty thousand marchers and more than 200 floats and marching units moved down <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. `` I say I'm Irish,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuinn </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, whose parents came from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` If a cat had a kitten in an oven, would you call them biscuits?

<TEXT>
 None of the voting-age residents in this village of 2,500 plans to cast a ballot in Sunday's presidential election `` No one here believes in this election,'' said <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>, a local leader of this town, which was repopulated in 1987 after being abandoned for seven years. `` This election is to prolong the war,'' said a man who identified himself only as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>. His comment echoed a refrain broadcast daily on two clandestine guerrilla radio stations of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. No love is lost between <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> and the U.S.-backed government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. His administration and its army consider the town, like others revived by people who returned from refugee camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, as hostile territory. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marta </PERSON>'s sympathies clearly lie with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel army waging a nine-year war against the government. The rebels have called for an election boycott to prove that a political solution is impossible without their participation. Every day from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., battery-powered radios in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> are tuned to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>. Like many rural communities in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, this one lacks electricity. Women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee before heading to the fields. On one morning this week, all listened to a radio account of overnight attacks on `` the puppet army'' and admonishments that every Salvadoran do his part to prepare for insurrection. Guerrillas wander through this town in <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice. Government soldiers, on their rare appearances, are shunned. `` The soldiers three times set fire to the cornfield around here,'' said <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>. `` The last time they came through, a few went up to people and told them, ` Just wait until <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is in power. We'll be back with a bomb for every house.''' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, is expected to win Sunday's election. In its campaign, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> has taken a hard line on the war, threatening a military solution. Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrarte </PERSON>, the provincial military commander, said in an interview that he hopes to improve relations with <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> through more personal contact. But he acknowledges the difficulties. `` The subversives count on them for supplies, recruitment and rest,'' he said. `` They portray us only as murderers, violators of human rights, ogres.'' An estimated 20,000 Salvadorans _ mostly from <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cabanas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> provinces _ were driven from their homes by the war, aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s. Since October 1987, about 6,500 have returned to rebuild their lives. `` When we came back, this was just woods and brush,'' said <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>. `` Every house had been burned, and the fields were overgrown.'' He said most residents never lost hope of going home. `` Our umbilical cords are buried here,'' he said, using a Salvadoran expression conveying the importance of one's roots. For their part, the guerrillas refer to the local residents as `` the heroic resettlers of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION>.'' `` They came back to confront the army without weapons,'' said a local guerrilla commander who identified himself only as <PERSON> Antolin </PERSON>. During its first year of reconstruction, the town depended on charity from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and church groups. But last year yielded a good harvest, and the village is nearly self-sufficient in corn and beans, the daily staples. A walk through the settlement showed residents building latrines, making adobe blocks, working on a chicken coop and pounding dried stalks of millet to separate the kernels from the chaff. Many are enlarging their homes of adobe, mud-and-wattle and corrugated metal roofs. The social arrangement is largely cooperative, with familes permitted small private plots to augment their communal ration. `` Because of the war, there are lots of widows and orphans here,'' said <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>. `` If we were n't a cooperative, those people would die.'' He said soldiers in the provincial capital of Sensuntepeque often stop trucks headed for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> loaded with donated food, clothing or construction materials. `` They think everything we bring up here is for the guerrillas. But we barely have enough for ourselves and are n't in a position to give things away,'' <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON> said.

 Passengers aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner sat in stunned silence when a fire on the plane's tail created severe vibrations so severe the pilot made an emergency landing. No one was injured. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 en route from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with 69 people aboard landed safely Friday at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, officials said. The vibrations, which began over the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> about 200 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, lasted several minutes and were followed by several minutes of silence on the airliner. `` There was no panic as far as people screaming. It's just that people were quite concerned,'' said R.E. `` Griff'' Greffenius, a business traveler from <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Officials discovered a charred area about 10 feet in diameter at the rear of the tail There also appeared to be damage to the stabilizer, the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control the plane's altitude. An investigator from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office examined the plane Friday night, and two more investigators were to arrive today, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON>, chief of the Aviation Accident Division of the safety board Continental officials in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said they believed the plane's auxiliary power unit, or APU, overheated An aviation source who had a chance to inspect the plane said a fire had damaged the stabilizer on the tail section near the APU, but he said the power unit itself was not charred. `` It -LRB- the stabilizer -RRB- is burned on the outside. The paint is burned off. But they do n't know how it occurred,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said a possibile cause could have had something to do with one of the plane's strobe lights. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said there was no indication of sabotage on the twin-engine jet, which carried 64 passengers and a crew of five.

<TEXT>
 A plan to clean up the worst air in the country by restricting everything from industry smokestacks to household aerosols has set the stage for a political battle royal in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The plan, approved Friday by two regional authorities, is intended to bring air quality in the four-county <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin up to federal clean air standards by 2007. The debate over the plan is being followed by smoggy cities across the country, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is preparing to renew the Clean Air Act. By 1994, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> officials plan to have phased in 120 rules in a detailed attack against pollutants arising from nearly every type of combustion _ from patio barbecues to coal-fired power plants. Eventually, the plan will require Southern Californians to drive cars powered by methanol, compressed gas or electricity; mow their lawns with electric lawnmowers and use reformulated paints, solvents and aerosols. `` The magnitude of the planning effort is without parallel anywhere in the country for a region of this size,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisano </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>. The air quality plan was adopted by the association on a 16-1 vote, and by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> board of directors by a 10-2 vote. The votes capped a contentious, eight-hour session that drew hundreds of people from environmental and citizens' groups, industry and government. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON>, who sits as a member of both boards, vowed to seek a referendum, which he contended would stifle economic growth. Union leaders also opposed tight restrictions on industrial pollutants, which they said could close factories and cost of thousands of jobs. `` They're talking about doing without gasoline,'' said an indignant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, west coast director of the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. An industry study by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> concluded the plan would cost $ 12.8 billion a year, a figure that contrasts sharply with the district's estimate of $ 3.9 billion annually. Altogether, the plan proposes 160 rules to be enforced over the next 18 years, reaching into unexpected corners of everyday life to attack smog sources both large and small: _ The suburban backyard scene would change forever with bans on charcoal lighter fluid for barbecues and requirements that lawn mowers and other tools run on either electricity or fuel that burns more cleanly than gasoline _ The number of drive-through burger stands might be limited to cut down on smog-generating engine idling while motorists wait for their orders _ State-required checks of auto pollution-control equipment would be more stringent, and new emission limits would be imposed on diesel trucks and buses The plan would cover a district of 13,350 square miles, covering <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> and part of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> counties.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government and the country's most feared guerrilla group have signed an accord to begin talks toward ending nearly two decades of bloody insurgency. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> in a nationwide television address Friday night asked the other Colombian rebel groups to follow suit. `` I urge all guerrillas to integrate themselves in civilian life. The road is always open,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said. An estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas operate in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. They are blamed for more than 2,000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings in 1988 alone. The accord was signed Friday in the mountain town of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, by the minister of <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Orejuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizarro </PERSON>, commander of the M-19, or the April 19 Movement. The April 19 Movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential election that the guerrillas say was fraudulent. Once the nation's most notorious group, M-19's bloodiest operation was seizing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in 1985. The army retook the building, but 11 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices and 85 other people were killed. A joint declaration said four meetings that led to the accord were held in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after the leftist guerrillas declared a unilateral cease-fire eight months ago. The declaration said both sides agreed on talks beginning April 1 that would `` lead to full democracy'' and reintegrate the insurgents into society. The talks are to finish before legislative elections set for March 1990, in which M-19 probably will participate as a legal political party, officials said. The agreement did not say when the guerrillas would have to give up their arms. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said the accord `` opens a time of hope for the fate of the country,'' but he said there large obstacles to overcome before attaining peace. He signaled that the government is ready to begin talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>, a communist rebel group that declared a unilateral cease-fire Feb. 28 in an effort to join the peace process. However, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said the cease-fire must hold for a certain period of time to determine if the <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> has `` a genuine spirit of reconciliation.'' The joint declaration also said the guerrillas will no longer operate underground and will base themselves in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, where they receive state protection and will not be subject to harassment by the army. During the signing ceremony, <PERSON> Orejuela </PERSON> said all sides must stay vigilant because `` there are people interested in seeing that a process like this one fails.'' The declaration said 13 guerrilla delegates who had no criminal record participated in the talks and had government protection.

<HEAD>Plans Canceled For Cable Car Up China's Great Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mayor of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has halted plans to build a cable car up the side of the Great Wall, yielding to preservationists who said it would desecrate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous landmark, official newspapers said today. The battle over the cable car had been fought for two years, with the main support coming from the Chinese builder and an army unit stationed near the Great Wall that was to supply engineers for the project. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> listened to both sides at a meeting this month before deciding. He convened the meeting after opponents publicly accused his office of pushing the project through in violation of a 1988 law protecting cultural relics. The cable car was to have been built at Badaling, about 43 miles north of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where for a few dollars tourists can walk along a small restored section of the Great Wall. Under the cultural relics law, no construction is allowed within 600 feet of the wall at Badaling. The Great Wall, a dramatic symbol of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s historic fear of foreign contact, actually began as a series of short walls built by independent kingdoms and principalities to keep out invaders. Efforts to build one unified wall began about 200 B.C. under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first emperor, <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huangdi </PERSON> The completed wall finally stretched 3,700 miles from the desert plains of north-central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the sea. Large portions are now in ruins. The <ORGANIZATION> Badaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> signed a contract to build the cable car a year before the cultural relics law was passed. Golden Glory agreed to invest $ 5 million in the project, with a $ 1.5 million guarantee if it was canceled, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said more than 20 architects and officials from the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and national cultural relics bureaus led the battle against the cable car. They even took the rare step of writing a letter to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. Several engineers concluded after a study that the project would lose money. Officials who backed the cable car said it would ease crowding on the wall and thereby prevent damage. Thousands of people visit the wall each day during the tourism season, from about April to October. Tourists currently reach the top via one central set of stairs, then can walk along the wall in both directions for several hundred feet. The wall is about 30 feet high at Badaling.

<HEAD>Japan Lifts Sanctions On Chilean Grapes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Fruit-Cyanide, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today lifted a four-day suspension on importing Chilean grapes after <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> pledged to step up safety precautions as a result of a cyanide scare, Japanese officials said. The Japanese government ordered the suspension Tuesday after traces of cyanide were discovered Monday in two Chilean grapes shipped to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The discovery followed anonymous threats to the Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> that Chilean fruit would be poisoned. The <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> government has reassured <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> it will step up safety precautions to guarantee that grape shipments are safe, leading <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to lift its ban on imports, said <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Katsumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoi </PERSON>. The decision comes on the heels of an announcement Friday by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that Chilean fruit exports were once again welcome in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It also comes after the detention Thursday in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> by naval authorities of five Japanese fishing boats `` for safety inspection.'' Chilean navy commander Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> initially said the ships were being held until <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lifted its ban. But Friday in a telephone interview, Chilean navy Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Araya </PERSON> said, `` The boats are retained and being subject to a mandatory thorough inspection. `` This is necessary for the safety of all people on board those vessels. Once inspectors are satisfied with the safety standards of the boats, they will let them sail off.'' <PERSON> Itoi </PERSON>, asked if the decision to lift <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ban on Chilean grapes was diplomatically motivated, said: `` The health of the Japanese people is our primary concern.'' There was no immediate word today from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s lifting of the ban. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has imported 1,775 tons of grapes from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> so far this year, representing about 20 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total imported grapes for the period, according to government figures.

<HEAD>Ambassador: Hostage Freedom Hopes May Not Have Been Hurt By Rushdie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said today the prospect of freedom for Western hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> may not have been hurt by the controversy over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book `` The Satanic Verses.'' `` The general assumption is, I think, that the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair has put back prospects of release. I am not sure that is correct,'' the ambassador, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON>, said in a radio interview from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I was encouraged, I must say, by the statements made by some leading Moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms that there is no reason to continue holding hostages. This is very much a crime against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. But, <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> warned, `` I do not want to raise release hopes and I do not want to sound over-optimistic.'' The Iranian spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, on Feb. 14 called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s execution for writing `` The Satanic Verses,'' which Moslems say blasphemes Islam. The Indian-born author, now a British citizen, has been in hiding under police guard since then. The 46-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> this week called <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> an apostate, which under Islamic law is punishable by death, and demanded that the book be banned. Asked about the release hopes for British hostages, <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> said: `` We have been at great pains to stress that one need not affect the other _ that the hostage issue is essentially a humanitarian issue.'' Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentialists, including Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, British journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who has dual <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and Irish citizenship. American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held of the 15 hostages. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> also played down suggestions that a car bomb blast Friday about 50 yards from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was intended for the embassy. `` We had some windows blown out and one or two other bits knocked off _ nothing very serious,'' he said. The explosion, which killed 15 people, was the worst in the area of the embassy for some time, he said. He said he was unaware of any increased hostility to Britons in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair.

<HEAD>ACLU Plans Appeal Of Judge's Ruling To Uphold Ban On Medicaid Abortions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for a 15-year-old allegedly impregnated in a gang rape plan to appeal a court ruling upholding a law that bans Medicaid funding for abortions. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausner </PERSON> said in a 26-page opinion issued Friday that there are no constitutional provisions entitling the teen-ager to state money for an abortion. An appeal will be filed Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleicher </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which brought the lawsuit on the girl's behalf. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> contends the Medicaid ban is unconstitutional because it discriminates against poor women. The lawsuit is the first challenge of the state's Medicaid-funded abortion ban, which took effect Dec. 12 after voters approved it in the Nov. 8 general election. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> also will file a motion Monday asking the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear the case immediately, bypassing the appellate court, <PERSON> Gleicher </PERSON> said. The appeals process will continue even if the teen-ager has an abortion, she added. `` Obviously we're unhappy and displeased with the judge's decision,'' <PERSON> Gleicher </PERSON> said `` But we always knew from the very start that this case would have to be decided in the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' Lawyers for the state and groups opposed to abortion were pleased with the ruling. `` The will of the people has been vindicated. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to impose its will on the will of the people has been rejected,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>, an attorney for Right to Life of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, the teen, identified only as `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>,'' became pregnant during a Jan. 15 rape and ca n't afford abortion costs of between $ 250 and $ 1,000. `` If <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> wants an abortion it can not be funded by the state Medicaid program but that does not mean that an abortion is not available,'' <PERSON> Hausner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hausner </PERSON> cited the testimony of doctors who said they sometimes perform abortions for free. Two of the teen-ager's alleged attackers, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Costnar </PERSON>, 17, both of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, face trial on first-degree criminal sexual assault charges on April 7.

<HEAD>Portuguese Diplomat Ordered To Leave Maputo As Dispute Deepens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today ordered a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> diplomat to leave the country within four days, apparently in retaliation for <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s expulsion of a Mozambican diplomat suspected of involvement in an assassination. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, commercial consul at the <ORGANIZATION> Portuguese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, has been declared persona non grata and must leave by midnight Tuesday. The ministry accused the consul of engaging in unspecified activities `` incompatible with his diplomatic status.'' The ministry statement did not mention <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s expulsion Friday of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Custodio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marques </PERSON>, third secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> of involvement in the killing of former Mozambican rebel leader <PERSON> Evo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>. The expulsion order was issued after <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> refused to waive <PERSON> Marques </PERSON>' diplomatic immunity so he could be questioned about the case. The dispute has strained relations between <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and its former colony at a time when links between them were growing. Portuguese newspapers have said a man held in connection with the murder of <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, former general-secretary of the Mozambican National Resistance rebels, accused <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> of helping plan the killing. According to the reports, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagas </PERSON> confessed to the murder and said he was acting for the Mozambican government. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> denies all involvement in <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>' death, claiming he was killed as a result of infighting among the rebels. <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> police found <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>' body last April on a hillside near <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. He had been shot in the head and chest. Chagas and <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Messias </PERSON> were arrested in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and extradited to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> to face charges in connection with the killing. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> citizen, was a founder member of the rebel movement and was its general secretary from 1983-1986. He was demoted to head of the rebels' research department but observers said he remained an influential figure within the organization. The rebels have waged a hit-and-run insurgency against <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist-oriented government since 1977, two years after independence. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> does not support the the rebels, but allows them to maintain an office in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of staging simulated nuclear attacks with B-52 bombers on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and demanded a halt to U.S.-South Korean military exercises. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials rejected the North Korean charge. American forces based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are believed to have nuclear weapons, though <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> refuses to address the issue. North Korean officials said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was using up to nine B-52 bombers from bases in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> to stage daily nuclear attack exercises over parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that resemble targets in the North. The officials said the exercise was preparation for a nuclear attack on the North. Also today, radical students with firebombs battled riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> after rallies to demand withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Riot police fired tear gas to drive back about 400 protesters at <ORGANIZATION> Dongguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and about 800 protesters at <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. `` Yankee go home!'' and `` Withdraw U.S. forces!'' protesters shouted. About 200,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops are taking part in the annual exercises, which began Tuesday and end next week. The `` Team Spirit'' exercises practice bringing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reinforcements in the event of a North Korean attack. About 42,000 American soldiers are normally stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. North Korean delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> meeting at the border site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> demanded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Korean forces immediately halt the annual exercises. The North once again said the exercises are a grave threat to peace on the divided peninsula and a barrier to peace talks. `` You should desist from attempting to justify your aggressive acts and discontinue at once the criminal war exercise ... blocking the way to detente and dialogue by leading the situation to the brink of war,'' said North Korean Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ui </PERSON> Ung. The <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> polices the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Rear Admiral <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said no nuclear attacks were being practiced. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> dismissed the North Korean charges as meaningless propaganda. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> represents the 16 nations that sent troops to aid capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> against the 1950 North Korean invasion. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> charged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was building up its military as part of possible plans to attack <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A North Korean attack launched the Korean war in 1950. `` Your side's continued military buildup, forward deployment of forces and secret military maneuvers _ all directed against the Republic of -LRB- South -RRB- <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ cause serious concern that your side may be preparing for another act of aggression,'' <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> repeated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that the `` Team Spirit'' exercises are purely defensive. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the past has denounced the maneuvers and charged they are part of preparations for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. But the exercises this year stalled North-South talks on easing tensions. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said last month that progress in government talks was impossible if the South went ahead with the exercises.

 A family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a funeral was abducted by a man fleeing the scene of his wife's shooting and forced to drive him in their car while he loaded a pistol and licked the tip of each bullet. `` I thought he was going to kill us for sure,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` We started to pray out loud as soon as he got into the car. He told us to shut up.'' The family was released uninjured after a harrowing two-hour odyssey on the side of a highway on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the man turned himself in to <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> police hours later. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, 39, turned himself in Friday afternoon, and was arrested on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and unlawful possession of a weapon, Police Sgt. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> was being held pending arraignment this morning. Police said <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> was wanted for the Thursday night shooting of his estranged wife, 34-year-old <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>. She was in critical condition late Friday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said a nursing supervisor. The shooting began an interstate trek across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a manhunt that involved police from <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> shot his wife several times about 10:15 p.m. Thursday in this northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> city and fled in his own car only to get into an accident a few blocks away, police said. Witnesses told police <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> pulled a revolver and ordered <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> to drive him to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> dropped <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> off near the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> then spotted Mrs. Gee and her family at a pay phone calling a cousin for directions, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions The family _ Mrs. Gee's husband, <PERSON> Allious </PERSON>, 74; her grandson <PERSON> Cedrick </PERSON>, 4, and her children from a previous marriage, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, 29, an Army staff sergeant stationed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Barbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, 18 _ had left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> early Thursday afternoon for the funeral of Mrs. Gee's uncle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The gunman forced the family to drive him to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. For a while, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> had the pistol aimed at <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s head as <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> tried to find a way to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Part of the time, he methodically loaded the gun and licked the tip of each bullet before shoving it into the pistol chamber, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Barbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> as saying. `` Now, I can shoot you all,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> recalled the gunman saying. `` One mistake and I'll shoot the boy in the head.''

 Gunmen driving through a working-class neighborhood in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s largest city today sprayed the streets with gunfire, killing 12 people and wounding one in apparently random attacks. Witnesses said the gunmen cruising in a car opened fire in five locations in the <LOCATION> Malir </LOCATION> district in western <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>. Police and soldiers in vehicles mounted with machine guns swiftly converged on the district, which is near the international airport, but the unidentified gunmen escaped, police said. The violence brought to 18 the number of people killed by marauding gunmen in cars or on motorcycles in this seaport since March 9. Police officials said they do n't know who is responsible or what motivates them.

 Authorities have issued new security orders to all major British airports as a result of the December bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, a <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> spokesman said today. The reported orders came amid criticism by opposition <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members, who say the government mishandled a warning of a terrorist attack before the disaster, which killed 259 people on board and 11 on the ground in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm any new orders, saying it would not discuss security arrangements. The <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> spokesman, who in keeping with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> practice refused to be identified, said the orders were received Friday night. He gave no details because they dealt with security matters. British new reports said the directive is believed to require that all passengers be ordered to remove electrical and electronic equipment from suitcases when they check in. They would then carry the items as hand luggage to be examined at boarding gates, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other news organizations said. Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Flight 103 on Dec. 21 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, was concealed in a radio-cassette player. The New York-bound flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and passengers and luggage changed to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. On Feb. 18, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> advised all airlines using British airports to begin asking travelers if their baggage contained radios, computers or other electronic equipment and then to examine the items for explosives. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> was criticized after admitting this week in the wake of newspaper disclosures that authorities were warned terrorists might bomb an aircraft with explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> confirmed Friday that the airline had received a warning from the West German government on Nov. 10 about the kind of radio-cassette bomb that caused the disaster. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has also acknowledged receiving a warning from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. But it said it received the British warning by mail weeks after the air disaster. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said this week the British warning contained `` unimportant'' information that supplemented what was in the earlier warnings. A legislator in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Friday accused `` hysterical Americans'' of a witch hunt, while party members rallied to fend off opposition charges over the airport security controversy. `` If every government and every airline broadcast every warning from every source _ crank or terrorist _ international air travel would grind to a halt,'' the legislator, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adley </PERSON>, said Friday. `` The culprit ... is the person who planted the bomb. It is not the -LRB- British -RRB- Secretary of State for Transport.'' <PERSON> Adley </PERSON> in his statement said `` malicious -LRB- opposition -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> politicians, hysterical Americans and news-hungry media'' had united in a `` witch hunt aimed at the Conservative government'' and <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adley </PERSON>, a senior member in the party of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, is an officer of the Conservative legislators' committee on transport. Another Tory legislator, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilshire </PERSON>, said Friday that some relatives of victims have been `` blaming the British government, blaming <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> -LRB- airport -RRB-, blaming anybody except the people I think they ought to be complaining about: namely the American government and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, however, the parents of five <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who died aboard the flight opened a petition drive Friday demanding a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inquiry and accusing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of treating them in a shoddy manner. `` There is an enormous amount of anger and outrage at the way we've been treated by this country's government,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Primeau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She spoke at a news conference in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION> Her 20-year-old twins, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Coker </PERSON>, who were among the victims.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today condemned recent petitions for the release of political prisoners and sought to discredit the requests as invitations for foreign pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Xinhua commentary was the latest in a series of official statements seeking to quell a growing clamor by Chinese intellectuals for an amnesty for prisoners of conscience and greater freedom of expression. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, first suggested an amnesty in an open letter to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in January. Since then, 118 other intellectuals have signed three similar letters, and hundreds of Chinese studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Chinese-Americans, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and Taiwanese have signed petitions of support. Several delegates are expected to push the idea at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, which begins its annual session Monday. The strongly worded <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> commentary, with its warning of `` foreign interference,'' appeared to be an effort to head off any public statement at the congress that could embarrass the government. Xinhua accused the letter writers of `` using foreign public opinion to exercise pressure on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government,'' although no foreign government has officially commented on the amnesty drive. It noted that several of the letters appealed for the release of <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> electrician who was sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in jail for `` counterrevolutionary crimes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>'s case was raised `` not because he is important but because his case aroused much discussion in the foreign press when it became public in 1979.'' The London-based human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has championed <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>. `` The Chinese people suffered enough from foreign invasions before the liberation of the country,'' the commentary said. `` Many problems and difficulties do exist, but these are <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s own affairs which the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people will overcome by themselves.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the national debate over rapid-fire assault weapons has `` gotten pretty hot'' and any decision about new restrictions will be made in `` a cool way based on facts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hinted Friday he may be willing to take some steps beyond the newly announced federal ban on imports of five popular types of semiautomatic weapons. Law enforcement officials are pressing for a prohibition covering weapons made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as well. `` The police have been very concerned about this and we've got to find an accommodation between the police and the sporting interest,'' the president said. `` In my view there can be an accommodation, there must be an accommodation,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and outspoken foe of gun control. Asked if the new ban on imports represented a change in position on gun control, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It represents certainly a heightened concern on my part about AK-47s. It's a pulse change,'' he added, grabbing his wrist. The debate over assault weapons has `` gotten pretty hot,'' he said, `` but we'll make our decisions from the administration in a cool _ you know, a cool way, based on facts and not swayed one way or another by the temper of the debate. `` But I can understand when kids are shot down by an automated weapon _ semiautomated weapon or automated, whichever it was _ why, I can certainly understand the public outcry.'' Five children were killed and more than two dozen others were wounded earlier this year in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, by a deranged gunman with a semiautomatic AK-47. The president discussed guns and other issues in a 30-minute chat with reporters on Air Force One as he returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from an overnight speechmaking trip to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. Instead of their customary weekend at Camp David, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> were remaining at the White House because their springer spaniel, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, was giving birth to puppies. `` It's changed my life, seriously,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in mock horror. `` You think I'm kidding about that? It's awful.'' The dog gave birth to six puppies over a five-hour period ending at about 2 a.m. this morning, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explained that the first lady had banished him from their room to the Lincoln Bedroom because of <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, who sleeps on their bed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his wife explained that `` <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> had a very bad night last night, thrashing around and you would be irritable.'' He added, `` So I'm being sent down the hall, which just suits the heck out of me.'' On other subjects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ No decision has been made on a proposed joint venture with the Japanese for production in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of a new version of the F-16 jet fighter He sought to play down earlier suggestions that a basic commitment had been made to the project, with only details remaining to be worked out. _ He was saddened that hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was beginning his fifth year of captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but said that would n't lead to any change or reformulation in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on hostages The fact that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other remain held against their will `` is with me every single waking hour.'' _ He was concerned about the 1 percent increase in wholesale prices in February reported Friday, claiming `` you always have to be vigilant'' against inflation He said the best way to fight inflation was to reach agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on reducing the budget deficit. _ Gave a thumbs-up sign on word that Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had won 92-0 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation as defense secretary A Tuesday swearing-in is planned, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` he'll go to work right away'' at the Pentagon. _ Signed a proclamation designating May 4 as a National Day of Prayer It has been an annual event since 1952.

 A cargo plane carrying explosives crashed after takeoff from <ORGANIZATION> Carswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> early today, killing the two people on board and igniting numerous grass fires, authorities said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Schudt </PERSON> said the two people killed likely were civilians because the DC-9 was a private aircraft under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The victims' identities were not immediately available. `` All of the pastures were on fire,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, a rancher who lives near the ranch where the plane crashed. `` I could see the plane's tires and they were on fire. I told my wife it was a plane crash, then I went to look to see if I could help.'' He drove through burning pastures in his truck but found no survivors. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundquist </PERSON> said the plane was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a private contractor based in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The plane that crashed was based in <LOCATION> Marana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The plane was en route to <ORGANIZATION> Tinker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> when the crash occurred about 2:30 a.m., said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Senior Airman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. A military board will investigate the crash, officials said. He said the cargo included 32 explosive fuses, which weigh a total of about 11 pounds. The plane crashed into a field about seven miles north of the base, which is about seven miles west of downtown <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkey </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Tarrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said he had been unable to go to the scene because the area was cordoned off until daylight. <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> said the wreckage was scattered over five acres. `` If it had been in a populated area, there would have been more lives lost than two,'' he said. `` It would have destroyed a lot of people and homes.'' The wreckage was almost unrecognizable in predawn light as an airplane except for its large landing wheels and its instrument panels, <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON> said.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 GEOGRAPHY _ The country covers 8,260 square miles, about the size of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. It is rugged, a land of volcanoes and lakes and rich soil. It is about 950 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 950 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 POPULATION _ Its more than 5 million people are mainly Roman Catholic and mestizo _ people of both <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> heritage.

<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ It was conquered in 1525 by the Spanish.

 Leftist guerrillas trying to sabotage Sunday's elections with a boycott and transportation ban have assured voters they wo n't be attacked if they go to the polls. However, some election workers in the capital and eastern areas resigned Friday, saying they had been threatened. Two mayors also quit after similar warnings.

 Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinians and wounded at least 17 today in clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army command confirmed that several Palestinians were killed and some wounded in riots in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but it could not provide exact figures.

An Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said demonstrations occurred today after Israeli policemen in jeeps and a gravel-firing machine arrived in the Sheikh Rajwan neighborhood and glued placards to house walls calling on the residents to maintain quiet. `` What's the benefit of a demolished house, a killed son?'' the reporter quoted the placards as saying.

 Leftist guerrillas trying to sabotage Sunday's elections by disrupting electrical power in the capital and traffic on the nation's highways assured voters today they wo n't attack people who vote. A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said guerrilla military actions might be intense Sunday but that voters will not be targeted. Today's warning about military activity followed two days of relative calm in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. There were no new reports of rebel attacks overnight. Earlier in the week, attacks by rebels knocked out much of the electrical power in the capital, and their threat to kill people who drove on the nation's highways drastically reduced traffic nationwide. On Friday, two mayors and some election workers in the capital and eastern areas resigned, saying they had been threatened by the rebels.

 Shuttle watchers who arrived in a parade of flag-bedecked motorhomes cheered, sang and cried with pride today as the winged spacecraft Discovery returned home. As the shuttle touched down the flag-waving crowd estimated at 450,000 broke into applause and spontaneously sang the national anthem. Tears streamed from the eyes of some, while others among the crowd hugged their children. Most snapped pictures furiously, marveling at the shuttle's steep angle of descent. `` I'm just fascinated by it,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dube </PERSON>, 34, of Canyon Country, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> was one of hundreds poised for a quick getaway, and was on the road right after the shuttle landed at 6:36 a.m. to avoid a massive jam that soon stacked up on the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> public viewing site Authorities estimated 138,000 vehicles were on hand. `` It's Saturday, if it was a work day I'd hang around a little longer,'' he said. As many as 300 motorists who arrived after roads to the base were closed simply pulled their vehicles off the highway and drove onto the desert to watch the landing. Several motorists ran into trouble, however, damaging their vehicles' axles when they drove into large desert potholes. Today's crowd of 450,000 was the second-largest to witness a shuttle landing. The record number was 500,000 for the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s July 4, 1982, landing. Many of the motor homes jamming the two-lane road leading toward <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where crowds began gathering earlier this week, sported huge <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. `` The patriotic spirit here is really something,'' said <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, 70, of Garden Grove. `` I even bought a new flag for this.'' Throngs of people, some arriving by motorcycle, others in cars pulling travel trailers, arrived several days early to claim the best viewing spots. On Friday, the strains of country music blared over loudspeakers at the makeshift campground as military helicopters buzzed overhead and skateboarders rattled across the hardened lake bed. Dune buggies and other off-road vehicles filled the area five miles from the <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> landing site with clouds of dust. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who arrived Wednesday, said he was on hand when the shuttle Atlantis landed last year. `` It was really worth it. It raises the hair on your back when you hear those sonic booms. Teardrops fall and the whole thing,'' he said. Many of the early arrivals were so-called `` snowbirds,'' retired couples who spend their winters in warm climates. `` We winter in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> every year and we just had to see the shuttle land,'' said 74-year-old <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sunnyside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who arrived with his wife, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>. `` I'm sure we'd see it better on TV, but we just had to be here,'' he said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolner </PERSON>, 35, a nurse from <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, witnessed the shuttle lift off Monday in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` My husband wanted to know what I wanted for Christmas and I told him I wanted to see the shuttle take off,'' she said. `` I spent the night in the car and watched it take off, and when I got home I told him I wanted to see it land. I flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Wednesday. I rented a car and here I am.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolner </PERSON> was quickly adopted by a family in a motorhome and was celebrating with the rest of the crowd. `` Everyone has such a sense of pride and respect,'' she said.

 A woman who was 10 minutes late for a court appearance because she stopped in a restroom was thrown in jail by a judge upset by the delay. `` It was a complete abuse of discretion, an abuse of the bail system,'' said attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenheel </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON>, 23, was late for her preliminary hearing Wednesday in connection with a robbery but needed to use a restroom, said her sister, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON>, adding that she went on to the courtroom to tell officials her sister would be there shortly. When <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON> reached the courtroom, Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON> demanded to know why she was late, revoked her $ 10,000 bail, ordered her to jail and raised her bail to $ 25,000. <PERSON> Keenheel </PERSON> said he planned to file a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was the most crazy, absurd, outrageous thing I've ever seen,'' he said. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday for reconsideration of the increased bail. Ms. <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON> is charged in the robbery of a store whose clerk picked her photograph out of an array of eight pictures. <PERSON> Keenheel </PERSON> said he planned to request a lineup during Wednesday's hearing to see if the clerk could identify Ms. <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON> in person. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutchen </PERSON> said the judge accused her sister of staying out of the courtroom so the clerk would n't see her before a lineup could be arranged. <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Saturday; he was not in his chambers and his home number is unlisted.

 A guerrilla squad sneaked into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and opened fire on troops, killing an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and wounding another before escaping back across the border, the army said today. No group claimed responsibility for the attack late Friday night, the fourth guerrilla raid against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a week. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> today said it arrested men who infiltrated <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, apparently referring to the guerrillas who ambushed the Israeli army patrol. The official <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> news agency, <PERSON> Petra </PERSON>, did not say how many men were arrested, but it said they were captured at 7 a.m. in <LOCATION> Wadi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Araba </LOCATION>, the same region where the attack on the Israeli soldiers took place. <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> said the incident was under investigation, but it gave no other details and did not explicitly link the arrests to the Israeli attack. The guerrillas ambushed the Israeli army patrol in the southern <LOCATION> Hatzeva </LOCATION> area 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said the troops responded with gunfire. Reserve Sgt. <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lior </PERSON>, 22, the commander of the unit, was killed in the gunbattle and another soldier was wounded in the arm, the spokesman said. The spokesman said a military unit discovered the tracks of two men, showing they had crossed into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and then returned. According to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, the ambush occurred when the army patrol followed tracks in the dirt and heard a man shout in English: `` Stop!'' from behind a bush. The guerrillas then opened fire from two directions. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas for the attack. `` The Egyptian border, the Lebanese border and the Jordanian one are different. If there is something in common it's the wish of the Palestinian terror groups to attack us from all the directions,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio `` We hold <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> responsible for preventing any infiltrations from its territory. Moreover, we demand the Jordanian government do everything to find who committed this vile murder and to make certain this will not happen in the future,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, chief of the army's southern command, described the incident as `` serious'' and said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio the attack `` makes it necessary to take efficient steps on the other side of the border to prevent any infiltrations into our territory and attacks on our soldiers.'' In <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, Information Minister <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Khasawneh </PERSON> said, `` It is not necessary that we comment on every story <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> broadcasts.'' Two other raids this week were in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the third across the border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 A 48-hour strike for higher pay by state railroad workers forced tens of thousands of vacationers and commuters to change travel plans and aggravated Easter holiday traffic problems, officials said Saturday. Railway unions arranged the strike to pressure management before negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. It was timed to coincide with the start of Easter holidays and end midnight Sunday. Company officials said the strike forced them to cut half the scheduled trains, leaving 300,000 fewer seats on routes. The cutbacks contributed to traffic jams as commuters competed on highways with holiday travelers flocking to the coasts and native regions. The General Traffic Division said 19 people died on Spanish highways over 19 hours Friday and Saturday.

<HEAD>Congress Becoming Restive over Salvador Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has been receiving a huge slice of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid program for years but now, as <LOCATION> Salvadorans </LOCATION> prepare to elect a new president, many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> feel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers have not been getting their money's worth. The Salvadoran war still rages, having claimed an estimated 70,000 lives, the economy is stagnant and politically-motivated killings are up, prompting some lawmakers to argue for a major policy shift regardless of who the next Salvadoran president is. The pressure for a new approach is expected to accelerate if, as expected, the candidate of the rightist ARENA party, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, wins the election outright on Sunday or the subsequent runoff. His principal opponent is Christian Democrat <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>. Despite <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s denials, the perception among many who count in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is that ARENA is tied to the death squads _ shadowy groups who target both real and suspected leftists, sometimes in cooperation with the military. Perception plays a key role in forming opinions on administration policy. Democrats tend to be outraged by figures that show an average of 20 political killings a month recently while Republicans note that such incidents once averaged 800 a month. Still, the situation was serious enough to warrant a forceful appeal last month by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to the Salvadoran military `` to work toward the elimination of human rights violations.'' The administration also is worried that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> might become a strategic headache for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels triumph. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been the source of large quantities of arms shipments to the guerrillas in recent months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lavished $ 3.55 billion on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1980 _ the largest program in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ in a bid to help the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> defeat the insurrection and to help the country establish stable democratic rule. The strong support for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> reflects in large measure congressional affection for outgoing President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, whose commitment to democracy is unquestioned but whose legacy, after almost five years in office, is regarded as mixed at best. Ill with cancer since last year, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> will step down on June 1. A congressional report completed recently suggests <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has actually made the situation worse in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Critics, such as Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, contend the benefits have been meager considering the size of the investment. `` For the past five years, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has enjoyed a free ride with the American taxpayers footing the bill,'' he said Friday. `` By most standards, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has failed the test.'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> has introduced legislation requiring that half of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s military aid for 1990 be withheld pending a presidential report on progress toward prosecution of human rights offenders and toward ending the war and death squad activity. The program for the current year calls for $ 292.5 in economic aid and $ 96.5 in military aid. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, told Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Wednesday he believes the administration should emphasize political and diplomatic measures to end <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war `` I think up till now we've tried to implement primarily a military track and it's failed,'' he said. `` I ca n't support more aid with no strings attached without significant changes in our whole approach to that country.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> strongly defended the Salvadoran government's approach to the conflict, pointing out that the army has unilaterally declared a cease-fire to last through June 1. In addition, five relatively free elections have been held since 1982 and <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has made a number of efforts to negotiate an end to the war, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the rebels `` are doing whatever they can to disrupt the election'' despite their stated desire for peace, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> predicted the rebel tactics will fail. `` We condemn <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> violence and applaud the efforts of ordinary Salvadorans to establish firmly democratic rule in their troubled country. The elections on Sunday will be the next step to achieving that goal,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Chafes Over Talk About a Slow-Motion Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two months into his presidency, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is struggling with perceptions that he hit the ground walking and chose a style of governance constrained by worry about policy stumbles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gone out of his way, in recent speeches and exchanges with reporters, to drive home the message that the only treadmill he's on is the exercising machine he uses in the White House residence. He chafed at suggestions by critics that his go-slow strategy on East-West relations gives Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the upper hand in world public opinion, saying `` I am not going to be pushed into speedy action because Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gives a compelling speech at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' He undertook an almost painstaking explanation of why he ordered time-consuming reviews of both foreign and defense strategy, saying `` we've got to map a strategy.'' But administration officials acknowledge that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pre-inaugural decision to conduct such reassessments contributed to an image problem once he settled into office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday that he moved quickly to defuse such `` ticking time bombs'' as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s endangered savings and loan industry. But he also said getting the nation ready for the 1990s and beyond is `` what my -LRB- long-term -RRB- agenda is all about.'' Speaking in this same context earlier in the week, he told insurance executives that `` I want to be a president who is remembered for preparing our country for the next century.'' The administration has been beset in recent weeks with a spate of news reports, often quoting both Democratic and Republican political experts, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has adopted a too-cautious leadership style. Because of this, the notion went, he missed the opportunity history has afford new presidents get to establish an agenda in their first 100 days in the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confronted such talk head-on during a question-and-answer session with reporters on March 14 in which he denied the administration was `` adrift.'' The president also argued that he had moved as quickly as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in 1981, to choose people for top-level jobs. What followed was an unmistakable White House campaign to blunt any continuing talk of an aimless presidency. `` I'm particularly amused by the notion that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration must do all kinds of things in our first hundred days,'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're succeeding an administration of our own party at a time when the country is in good shape. ... `` The notion of the ` 100 days' came in with <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, who took over a country in the depths of a depression,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks about vision, he asked, `` Does that mean anything? When he says something, hang loose until he does it. Drug war? Where is it? Education president? When?'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, a Republican political consultant, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has got to satisfy the public's need to see accomplishments taking place.'' `` It's not enough to be just a statesman. You have to be a politician as well,'' he said. <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> successfully used television frequently to `` visually demonstrate forward motion'' _ even if little was being done. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, a special assistant to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who helps plan the president's activities and concerns himself with the president's image, said: `` I think the 60-day report card is probably going to be pretty tough But I think the 365-day report card is going to be a better barometer.'' White House officials say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has moved forthrightly with his domestic policy agenda, noting that in addition to proposing a rescue plan for the troubled S & amp; Ls, he has continued to seek a budget compromise with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and sent lawmakers his legislative proposals on such issues as child care and the minimum wage. One official, discussing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy on grounds of anonymity, acknowledged, however, that presidential aides recently scrapped the `` theme-a-week'' strategy used early on _ ethics one week, budget the next, drugs the next, and so forth. The official said the unpredictable flow of news events, and the extent to which a president's visibility is often dictated by these occurrences, made it impractical to try to sustain a single theme through a week's time. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a Democratic consultant, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` a good inaugural'' and had set a constructive tone in his statements about seeking bipartisan consensus on major issues. But he said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House `` wasted tremendous political capital'' on the enervating battle to win confirmation of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of defense. `` History has shown that the first 100 days will prove the tone and the effectiveness of a new administration, and he's wasted two-thirds of it,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. `` And I think what you're headed for is a weak presidency.''

 For one night at the <ORGANIZATION> Subs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> bar, everything was on the house _ even much of the house itself. A brash manager, without the owner's permission, apparently gave away $ 2,000 worth of liquor, beer and wine, police reported. He also gave away or sold tables, chairs, glasses, a television set and 15 neon beer signs. The cash register also went. The manager apparently pocketed any money made on the sales, police said. `` Apparently their liquor license was expiring and they were going to close shop,'' police investigator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Falls </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` The manager may have just taken advantage of the situation.

 Discovery's astronauts swooped out of orbit to a desert landing and the cheers of 450,000 spectators today after a nearly flawless journey that completed a vital space communications network and mapped a fragile Earth. Commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a touchdown on a concrete runway at this flight test base at 6:36 a.m., concluding a flight that covered 1.9 million miles in 4 days, 23 hours, 39 minutes. The shuttle landed on the runway's center line. `` Well done Discovery. That's one to be proud of,'' capsule communicator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON> said as the craft rolled to a stop. Forty-five minutes after touchdown, the five astronauts, all looking fit and smiling, left the spacecraft and were met by several <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials. They took the traditional walkaround inspection of Discovery, and closeup television pictures showed the fuselage in very good condition. There was no evidence of the severe tile damage that <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> suffered in December when it was hit by insulation falling off a booster rocket and fuel tank during the launch. The crew was driven to a medical facility for brief examiniations and later were to meet with their families before flying back to their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` There is no significant damage to the tiles,'' shuttle chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> told a news conference. `` This is the cleanest orbiter of any orbiter I've ever seen.'' Truly said the astronauts were very healthy and said the flight `` shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is.'' Two loud sonic booms cracked over the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert as Discovery glided powerless through clear skies, with the huge crowd, some waving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, shouting its approval from viewing sites on parched <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> estimated the crowd, which streamed in overnight in more than 138,000 vehicles, at 450,000. An hour before landing, Coats fired braking rockets 196 miles above the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to drop Discovery out of orbit and start it on a fiery dive through the atmosphere on a course over the mid-Pacific, across the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast south of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> and into this <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> base. `` Discovery's coming home,'' Coats radioed after the firing. The spaceship was traveling more than 200 mph when it touched the runway, but slowed quickly as Coats operated new brake systems designed to improve performance. As the flight neared an end, the crew tidied up the cabin, checked all reentry systems, closed the payload bay doors and donned bulky spacesuits for use in case of an emergency bailout. The astronauts were awakened today by a recording of their children saying such things as, `` Get up, dad, get out of bed, get to work,'' and `` Hi, daddy, this is your darling daughter telling you to wake up.'' That was followed by a recording of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s `` What a Wonderful World.'' The crew responded with a recording of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkle </PERSON>'s `` Homeward Bound.'' It was the 28th shuttle mission and the third since the Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years ago. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to complete seven flights this year and 12 a year by 1992. `` It's about the cleanest flight we've had from a failure standpoint,'' flight director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said Friday night. `` I've been involved in every shuttle flight and I've never seen so few failures. The only problem came early in the mission from an erratic pressure reading on a hydrogen tank that helps provide electricity to the orbiter. The astronauts conserved energy by turning off unnecessary lights and computers for a day until ground controllers corrected the difficulty. The shuttle is commanded by Coats. The pilot is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and the mission specialists are <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>. The five completed their primary mission just six hours after liftoff from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Monday, the deployment of a $ 100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite that completes a constellation of three such spacecraft. The new satellite, which will be operational in a few weeks, will enable <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to have nearly constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites. At that point, the space agency will begin closing six ground stations at a savings of $ 13 million a month. With the satellite deployed, the astronauts turned their attention to photographing the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and conducting several experiments. They shot nearly three miles of film with a 70mm IMAX camera, capturing views of pollution patterns in oceans, floods in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, burned areas of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, deforestation in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and erupting volcanoes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. During an interview from space Friday morning on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> said the scale and scope of air pollution `` is much more dramatic'' as seen from orbit. `` What we're trying to do is get some evidence and documentation to bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into this atmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in future generations,'' <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> said. The IMAX film will be edited into a movie called `` The Planet Earth,'' which will document environmental damage by man and nature. Some of the experiments aboard Discovery included the use of four rats and 32 fertilized chicken eggs. The end of the mission also marked the end for the rats, which were to be killed soon after touchdown so researchers can determine how their intentionally cut legs healed in the weightlessness of space. Most of the eggs, housed in an incubator, will be allowed to hatch to see if embryos can develop normally in space.

<TEXT>
 Young Soviet women will soon be able to discard their unstylish clothes and for the first time buy the same trendy fashions as their European and American counterparts. Three European companies are finalizing joint-ventures they believe will revolutionize Soviet fashion by offering Soviet women the Western styles they can now get only from friends traveling abroad, foreign currency stores or the black market. The deals will put branches of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Coppernob chain and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stefanel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> chains _ which all cater to the youth market _ in cities across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet women will get their first chance to buy Western clothes by the end of March when <ORGANIZATION> Stefanel </ORGANIZATION> expects to open two stores in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, an account executive for <ORGANIZATION> Stefanel </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations firm, said Friday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Under a joint venture contract with the city of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> signed in September, he said, one store will accept the Soviet ruble and the other dollars, which tourists and limited numbers of Soviets have access to. American-born designer <PERSON> Gifi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, whose Coppernob clothes are sold in more than 50 British stores, said Friday he expects to open four or five stores in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> this fall _ all accepting rubles. He also expects to open a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> factory by the end of the year to assemble partly made clothes imported from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> <PERSON> Verengo </PERSON>, said the company has been negotiating an agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government that would allow them to open about 50 stores in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities and build two or three factories to produce <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> clothes for the Soviet market. He said the agreement was likely to be signed this year. Fields credited Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s desire to reform the Soviet economy and meet the growing demand for consumer goods for the decision to allow Western clothing firms into the country for the first time. The joint ventures, he said, offer `` a historic opportunity'' to bring the Soviet people closer to their European neighbors with whom they share a similar culture and taste in clothes. `` Obviously there's a great potential in a market which is basically dealing in total functional clothing with no flair,'' said Fields, 37, in an interview. He said London-based Coppernob has reached agreement in principle with two <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> cooperatives, <PERSON> Nevski </PERSON> <PERSON> Zori </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lilia </PERSON>, to open the factory and branches throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Details of the accord, reached during a trip to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in February, were being finalized. Under the deal, he said, <PERSON> Coppernob </PERSON> will invest any profits in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He did not say how much <PERSON> Coppernob </PERSON> would invest in the project. `` Initially we're starting the operation off as small,'' he said. `` I can see us in 10 years time producing mega-amounts of fashion clothing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> not only for the marketplace in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but to service the rest of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and possibly even the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The clothes going on sale in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> this fall will be virtually the same as the clothes he'll be selling in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ lots of wool tweed jackets with short skirts or jeans, rich corduroys and stylish but simple velvet dresses. `` Good young fashion is like music, it transcends all boundaries,'' Fields said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers are defending their client by trying to show President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally directed a strategy of secretly assisting the Contras without informing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The approach by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers has featured two significant disclosures so far at his trial: _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed off on a deal to slip $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in exchange for that country's government help to the guerrillas _ The president apparently gave the go-ahead for airdropping intelligence and recoilless rifles for the sinking of arms-bearing ships, this at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned military aid to the Contras North's lawyers have been able to focus much attention on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role in secretly supporting the Contras, with more disclosures to come. Part of North's defense is built around previously unpublicized quid pro quo arrangements the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and other countries. North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is hoping, through the discussion of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s role, to convince the jury that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s actions in secretly helping the Contras were taken at the behest of the president. `` We do n't comment on pending legal matters,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the former president, said when asked about the testimony concerning <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actions. The apparent weak point in <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s approach is that it relies on blurring the line between lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and avoiding <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> initialed the secret quid pro quo arrangement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1985, <PERSON> North </PERSON> recommended that a special emissary unlikely to be questioned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> be entrusted with details of the proposed deal. The normal course would have been to communicate the arrangement through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, who could expect to be called to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for questioning. Former-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should n't be told about third-country support for the Contras. The president's inner circle of advisers kept information on Contra aid secret, even from each other. What they did n't know, they would n't be able to communicate if asked by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, including the president and vice president and several Cabinet officers, discussed the possibility of pressing third countries for Contra aid at a 1984 meeting in the White House Situation Room. Unbeknownst to some of them, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had already agreed to give $ 1 million a month. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who moderated the meeting, remained silent about the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> arrangements, which he had helped set up. When a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official was questioned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he responded that he had heard there was third-country support for the Contras, but that he knew nothing about it. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who did know, was n't asked. But a strategy of silence was no longer possible in September 1985. By that time, the news media were linking <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> to fund-raising efforts and tactical advice being offered the Contras. Letters came in from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Answers were demanded. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was on the spot. In testimony last Thursday, the former national security adviser said he discussed the congressional queries with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. There was no indication from <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s testimony that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recognized the complexion of the problem had changed completely; that in order to retain secrecy, answers would have to be hedged or falsified. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said he simply told the president that `` we were bound to be criticized in any event,'' no matter what the responses to letters from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` accepted it,'' saying, `` OK,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> recalled. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, in his questioning of <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, repeatedly elicited testimony that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never suggested lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, part of the prosecution's effort to show it was <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s idea Four of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> are that he obstructed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or made false statements by preparing written denials in 1985 that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffers were involved in assisting the Contras. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who signed the letters, pleaded guilty to three misdemeanors and was fined $ 20,000. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to a fourth misdemeanor in connection with congressional testimony he gave denying knowledge of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government support for the Contras.

<HEAD>Deliberations Begin in Wright Ethics Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> appears to be bracing for bad news from the 12 members of an ethics committee who convene this week to deliberate a series of charges against him in a process not unlike that of a grand jury. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has suggested in recent days he would be willing to admit to bad judgment in handling his finances if the panel draws such conclusions. He also has enlisted lieutenants to defend him on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and sought advice on how to handle his situation from close <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. At the same time, nervousness is rising among House Democrats and there are murmurs of severe political trouble for the speaker even if the panel recommends mild sanctions for any rules violations. The committee, after a lengthy investigation, heard three weeks of arguments from its investigator, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is accused of misusing his office for financial gain, including using staff to prepare a book on which he earned $ 55,000 in royalties, accepting free use of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium and improperly lobbying federal savings and loan regulators. The ethics panel was to resume deliberations on Monday and planned to meet most of the week. Members said it increasingly appeared that no result would be reached until after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from its Easter break in early April. The committee could recommend sanctions ranging from censure to expulsion if it finds the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. Such a recommendation is akin to a grand jury indictment and would be subject to a disciplinary hearing and ultimately a vote of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. If it finds no merit to the charges, it could simply drop the case. As the committee met behind closed doors last week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was sending intriguing public signals. At an impromptu lunch with reporters on Tuesday, he grew contemplative and said he might not run for a third term as speaker if the ethics report eroded his backing among Democrats. `` I would n't want to be speaker unless my colleagues want me to be speaker,'' he said. At the same session, he seemed to be preparing for a harsh report. `` If the committee should say, ... ` We think this is bad judgment,' well, I'll accept that. I have confidence in them. I'm not going to quarrel with that I probably have done things which in hindsight were poor judgment.'' But he continued to deny any violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and suggested that any lapses were the result of inattention to his personal finances rather than intentional wrongdoing. And he said his support remains strong. `` After this is resolved, I'll be stronger than ever,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` My colleagues have confidence in me, or they tell me they do.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments came after his attorney had heard <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> present his findings to the ethics panel. The tone was markedly different from last June, when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defiantly asserted: `` It should be abundantly clear that the charges against me hold no water whatsoever.'' Both the chairman of the ethics committee, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., and the senior Republican, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, say they believe a polarized, partisan outcome to the probe is unlikely `` I have no reason now not to believe it will be bipartisan,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> told the Wall Street Journal. That raised the possibility that some counts against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> have enough weight that <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> will feel compelled to vote for a statement of alleged violation, the panel's equivalent of an indictment. According to many <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members interviewed last week, such a move would put the speaker's job in serious jeopardy. `` I think concern is rising,'' said one senior Democrat, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` It's a very serious matter.'' `` The guy has problems,'' said another <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, saying <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s alleged misdeeds would become a difficult election issue for the party. `` Members do n't want to be defending their leaders. They want leaders they can be proud of, and who help them.'' Added another: `` We are weary of having this color our whole existence. People back home keep reading and hearing about it. I'm trying to do important work here, but they do n't see that I'm concerned about the perception. While Democrats generally would not speak on the record, Republicans were n't so reticent. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his party was being careful not to make the speaker's problems appear the result of a partisan vendetta `` I hear it's going to be very tough, a lot of different counts, sufficient to indicate a pattern of misjudgment or ethical lapses,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. He said that in some ways the Republicans would be better off with a wounded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as speaker than with a squeaky-clean replacement. `` I'd much rather have <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as speaker with half the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wondering, ` What's going on with this guy?''' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said.

 Nearly 400 years ago a young man about <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apparently tried to start what would now be called a punk fashion: he took to wearing his blonde hair long over his left shoulder but short on the other side. The fashion failed to catch on but the young man, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wriothesly </PERSON>, Third Earl of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, is remembered anyhow. Many authorities believe <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> was writing his sonnets at the time _ 1594 _ in support of a family effort to make the 20-year-old earl get married and produce an heir. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> wrote two longer poems for him, one with a dedication evidencing as much friendship as was socially acceptable at that period between a mere playwright and a nobleman. A tiny oval portrait of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, showing the unsuccessful `` lovelock,'' is a feature of a show of `` Treasures from the <LOCATION> Fitzwilliam </LOCATION>,'' the museum of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, opening Sunday at the National Gallery of Art. `` The <LOCATION> Fitzwilliam </LOCATION> is perhaps <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s pre-eminent small museum,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of the National Gallery. The painting is by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, the most famous miniaturist of the period. Only about an inch and a half in height, it was done on the back of a calfskin playing card. Three hearts can still be seen on the other side. <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> did get marrieda few years later, after a scandalous affair with a lady in waiting to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. He had been a favorite of the queen and later she commuted a death sentence against him for taking part in a conspiracy against her. He died on a military expedition to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1624. The exhibition includes more than 160 objects from the <LOCATION> Fitzwilliam </LOCATION>. They range from a bit of soft-core pornography by the 18th century British satirist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogarth </PERSON> to a portrait by Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON> of <PERSON> Arhcbishop </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Laud </PERSON> _ a strict and highly dignified churchman who helped get King Charles I into a lot of political trouble 100 years before. Both Laud and the king were beheaded. There are also a little water spaniel in painted porcelain and assorted coins, drawings, furniture, manuscripts and bronzes. The most famous painting is one by <PERSON> Titian </PERSON> that by coincidence deals with the same subject as <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s poem to <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> with the friendly dedication, `` The Rape of Lucrece.'' The picture was painted in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, about 25 years before <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> wrote the poem. The exhibition will be at the gallery's East Building through June 18. Then it goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Kimbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, July 15 to Oct. 8; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Nov. 5 to Jan. 28, 1990; the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, Feb. 20 to May 6, 1990 and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, June 21 to Sept. 9, 1990.

 <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, the first dog, was nursing her litter of six pups today after giving birth at the White House with first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> serving as midwife, a spokeswoman for Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Mom and babies and midwife are doing fine,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who said the puppies were born over a five-hour period ending at about 2 a.m. this morning. `` It was a wonderfully uneventful birth,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, adding that the litter contained five females and one male. Today the puppies were `` nursing vigorously,'' and <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> had eaten as well, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> out for a walk twice today. Word that <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> was about to deliver came about 9 p.m. Friday as the Bushes were entertaining a group of guests for a movie, `` New York Stories,'' in the White House theater following dinner. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slipped quietly out, and, according to Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, `` At the end of the movie, the president announced we had two puppies and more on the way.'' Subsequently, `` the president was in on one birth, lending moral support,'' and he brought Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a folding mattress in the remade White House beauty salon where the birthing room had been set up. Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said she was talking on the phone to the first lady when, `` She said ` Here comes <PERSON> George </PERSON> with a bed. Is n't that sweet?''' According to Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the sire of the litter was another springer spaniel, <PERSON> Tug </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, owned by a family friend, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, who also gave them <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>. Tug III lives at <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s End Farm in <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` The puppies are all promised, but for the next four to six weeks they will live upstairs at the White House,'' the spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>'s pregnancy had already caused an upheaval in sleeping arrangements at the highest level of the nation's government. Earlier Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disclosed that although the puppies were born in a whelping box in the beauty parlor, the dog had been spending her nights in the first family's bedroom. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'd been spending the nights by himself. `` The dog refuses to go to the doghouse is the problem,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. He said the dog adamantly refused to use `` a beautiful pen made for her to have this blessed event in,'' and insisted on remaining in the White House master bedroom. On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a bed moved into the beauty parlor for the first lady, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. He then went to bed by himself in another room, she said.

 Prices are on the upswing even as signs of an economic slowdown emerge, suggesting Americans may have to pay now for earlier robust growth in the economy and wait until later for inflation relief. Concern about inflation heightened last week after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in February for the second straight month, representing a 12.6 percent annual rate of inflation so far this year. Consumer prices, meanwhile, rose 0.6 percent in January, a pace that would translate into a 7.2 percent annual inflation rate at the retail level if sustained all year. Financial markets will be anxiously awaiting February's readout on consumer prices, due to be released Tuesday. A booming economy can generate inflation if tight labor markets and strong demand for goods and services create shortages that drive up wages and prices, which then chase one another upward. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been nudging interest rates higher in order to cool the red-hot economy and restrain inflation, but the latest reports show that prices were accelerating nonetheless. The troubling news came just as economists were starting to take some cheer from indications that economic growth may be moderating to a more sustainable level. Retail sales, factory operating rates and housing starts all were down last month. So why did prices rise? `` It reflects mainly strong growth in the economy in the past couple of years and full employment and high operating rates,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON>, outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary for economic affairs. He cautioned that given the lag time between an economic slowdown and the resulting downward pressure on prices, `` the worst of both worlds is not impossible.'' `` The risk is that we will get both slower economic growth and continued inflation and that certainly is what we hope to avoid,'' <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said. The concern was echoed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` To find out that inflation is almost out of control here, just as we see evidence the economy is slowing, is clearly the worst possible scenario,'' he said. `` We could have a rough couple months ahead. The old nemesis stagflation could come back to haunt us.'' The term `` stagflation'' was coined in the 1970s, when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> experienced the unprecedented combination of slower economic growth and rising prices. Initial forecasts for this year were that inflation would increase somewhat from the 4.4 percent pace of the last two years, but many estimates are being revised upward based on the surprising price increases in January and February. Meanwhile, growth in the economy is expected to slow this year as the record peacetime expansion extends through its seventh year. Indeed, some critics of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> say the central bank's tight grip on the money supply could dampen the economy so much that the country topples into a recession `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> must be patient because it takes a long time for changes in monetary policy to have an impact on prices,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` The immediate focus must be on the signs of economic contraction which indicate that Fed policies have become too severe.'' Some analysts, however, believe a recession may be the only way to reduce inflation once it starts spiraling. `` Unless we have a recession, we do n't think inflation is going to come down that much,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It shows the cost of reducing inflation. It also shows the cost of not keeping inflation from accelerating.'' Americans paid that price in the last economic downturn, when then-Federal Reserve Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> pushed the prime rate up to a high of 21.5 percent to combat the nation's worst case of inflation since the Civil War. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> won the war, but not without plunging the country into the 1981-82 recession, the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

<HEAD>Four Years of Captivity for Terry Anderson</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Freshmen have become graduates. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has served a second term in the White House and retired. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has come to office with an inaugural call for those who hold Americans captive to free them and beget an era of good will. And <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, prisoner of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, has seen none of it. Incredibly, it has been four years since the Saturday morning the telephone rang with word that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, had been kidnapped by gunmen on the way home from a game of tennis. At the time, it seemed to his editors and others among his colleagues that the kidnapping probably was an outrageous scare tactic aimed at reporters, and that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> would be held for a day, perhaps a few days. That had happened before, to other journalists, in the chaos among the factions still battling in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But the days stretched into a sentence that has passed its fourth year with no sign of a way out. The signal dates that might be chosen for release _ a birthday, then another and another; the presidential election; the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inauguration _ have passed with no respite for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The first and only declared demand of the captors was for the release of radical Moslems imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for terrorist activities. In his inaugural address, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke of the hostages, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and eight other Americans seized after he was taken. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seldom had spoken of their captivity since the scandal that embroiled his administration over the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Three American hostages were freed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986. `` There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was more explicit, saying that he looked to a day of better <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and saw the hostage issue as one that could help lead to such a thaw. He said that while <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> clearly has influence over the captors, he is not certain the Iranian government has clear control of the hostage situation. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there would be no change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against concessions or ransom to free hostages, a policy <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared but abridged during the arms sales. `` We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostages,'' he said. One gesture that could be made within that framework remains pending but stalled. It is the standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer of compensation to the families of 290 people killed when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship mistakenly shot down an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on July 3, 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains committed to compensation payments, but that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not provided information about the families, data needed to determine payment levels and set up a distribution system. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer was to make payments directly to families, not through the Iranian government. While the administration has barred concessions for hostage release, it has said it is willing to talk with the captors. But there has been no direct contact, official or for hostage families. That silence intensifies the frustration for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s colleagues who are, after all, communicators, accustomed to asking questions, gaining information, getting answers So when they gather, as at Thursday's fourth anniversary, they deliver to one another their message to the captors, words that may find a way to the faction holding <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They say that holding <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the other hostages is no way to tell a story but is, instead, damaging the Moslem image. They say that kidnappers keep out reporters who would otherwise come to learn and tell others about <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They say that what is happening to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the others is so unjust as to be unthinkable. `` This can not continue,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister. `` Enough, for God's sake. Enough.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, 49, a Christian Democrat. A youthful-looking but uncharismatic lawyer and former foreign minister whose campaign motto is, `` To live in peace is to live better.'' The technocratic <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> represents th conservative wing of his party and generally is accepted as the `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> candidate,'' a man who will continue the programs of outgoing President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally. He answers charges of party corruption by saying he represents a cleansing new leadership. He says he will seek a negotiated settlement with leftist guerrillas, privatization of some state companies, and a free-market economy. Also proposes new social programs to improve medical care and housing for the needy. Polls show him running second, but it may be a strong enough second to force a runoff.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, 41, of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. He is a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate in business administration. This political newcomer is a a millionaire coffee grower who opponents say is a front man for <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, the man often accused of organizing right wing death squads. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> denies the charge. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> says he will offer the guerrillas a chance to join the political process or face a `` professional, efficient army.'' He wants an open economy to generate jobs. He says he will reduce public spending and help women and children. He often expresses resentment of economic and social programs he says were imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, 57, of the leftist Democratic Convergence. A Social Democrat who spent seven years in exile leading a party closely allied to the leftist guerrillas. He returned in late 1987. Despite the rebel call for an election boycott, they say his participation is valid. Ungo considers peace the main issue and supports a negotiated settlement with the guerrillas. He wants a non-aligned foreign policy, redistribution of income and an economy geared to solving social problems. He is running third in the polls and acknowledges <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> probably will lead the first round of voting. But he says his party will be pivotal in a runoff and hopes to use its leverage to force political change.

 Travel industry leaders are worried that visitors who bring an estimated $ 2 billion a year in tourism and convention spending to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may start shunning shun the city because its distinction as the nation's capital is being overshadowed by its image as the nation's `` murder capital.'' `` We're very concerned about it,'' said <PERSON> Muneer </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some of the associations are calling us and saying, ` What's going to happen to your city? Do we have to cancel?' Another thing it might affect is the family traffic in the summertime.'' <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said the hotel association is embarking on a major public relations and advertising effort to assure potential tourists the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is a safe place to visit. As of midday Friday, 113 people had been killed in the city so far this year _ many the victims of drug turf wars. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsoring two major meetings here this year, has contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to urge that action be taken to counter negative national publicity. `` ABA is just trying to anticipate a potential problem and prevent it,'' said association spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Serepca </PERSON>. `` The problem would be a decline in our conference attendance. We have n't seen any yet.'' Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, a regional chamber of commerce, have begun studying the problem, a spokeswoman said. Federal drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> announced this week that the district may be a laboratory for testing ways to attack the nation's drug problem `` We're very encouraged with Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s announcement that he'll make the city a model for his program,'' said <PERSON> Deen </PERSON>. `` That's a very positive thing he did.'' But some people in the travel business believe tourists will keep coming to the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> despite its flagging image. `` Thus far, there's been no impact on the tourism industry,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON>, director of tourism at the convention and visitors association. She said tourism went up 3 percent in 1988, a year in which a record 372 homicides were committed. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is not going to get hurt as far as the tourism business, even though its PR -LRB- public relations -RRB- is at the lowest ebb it's ever been,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Omega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>, which has 120 agencies nationwide. `` Most visitors are coming to the capital for some specific reason _ they're either politically motivated, or they're bringing school groups, or something,'' he explained. `` It's a destination city versus just a convention city.'' Other cities' problems _ gang wars in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, riots in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the high crime rate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ have been more damaging, but the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, with its monuments and the federal government's presence, has unique appeal, <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> said. `` I think they realize the victims of the murder rate are not visitors to the district,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> said he does see a trend in which many tourists are choosing to stay in hotels in the adjacent suburbs of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> rather than downtown. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tampio </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, Va.-based Close Up Foundation, which organizes high school trips to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the city's problems have n't changed the group's plans but have aroused parents' fears `` Parents are concerned. That's what we have to deal with,'' he said. Close Up brought 25,000 young people here last year. `` We show them all of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. We do n't try to hide <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s warts,'' said <PERSON> Tampio </PERSON>. `` We want to show them that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, besides being the home to the federal government, is a real American city with all of its problems and possibilities.''

<HEAD>Prison Furlough Programs Provide Some Rewards and Considerable Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The case of an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> inmate charged with murdering his former wife during a brief prison furlough reflects rising concern in many states for striking the right balance between rehabilitation and public safety. Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> suspended the furlough program that released <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> hours before <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, 29, was beaten to death March 4 outside her northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> says the program may never be restored and directed seven prison officials to face disciplinary hearings. Most state prisons allow limited inmate furloughs, brief periods of freedom ranging from a few hours to a week when prisoners can look for a job, visit a relative, get a medical exam or attend a funeral. Thousands of other prisoners work day jobs and return to prison at night. `` These people are going to get out eventually,'' says <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> prisons spokeswoman <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumbly </PERSON>. `` We're preparing them, easing them out, getting them re-acclimated to living in the community.'' A furlough can be a payoff, too, for an inmate who does n't make trouble. `` It's a reward for good behavior and adherence to discipline,'' says <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s prison department. A few states, such as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, do n't allow furloughs or work release. Other states, including <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, have turned to extended furloughs and early release to relieve prison overcrowding. The system appears to work smoothly, most of the time. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> runs an extensive furlough program, granting 5,658 work-release permits and 14 compassionate furloughs last September alone. Only one inmate failed to return. Missouri reports 99.9 percent of inmates furloughed in 1988 obeyed the rules and committed no new crimes. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has become only the latest in a growing number of states, however, that are tightening the rules on furloughs, or eliminating some programs entirely. Even the very few failures may shatter public confidence, threaten political careers and end lives. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, the furloughed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> inmate who terrorized a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple and became a political battering ram in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign against <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, is merely the best-known of those failures. There are others: _ In the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, 38, had been sentenced to eight years for beating Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> in 1987, two years after their divorce, and she had become a counselor and advocate for battered women Prison officials knew of <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>'s continued hostility toward her, but failed to warn Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, as promised, of his release. In an interview videotaped by prosecutors two years ago, a badly bruised Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> had threatened to `` make my life so miserable that I would wish daily that I was dead.'' `` I bartered for my life yesterday and told him that I would not prosecute,'' she continued. `` I'm afraid if he does get ahold of me again that I'm not going to be able to talk about it.'' <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> will face the death sentence if convicted. _ In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, prison trusty <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was charged with shooting to death his girlfriend during a weekend release in August 1988 <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> was serving a life sentence for killing his wife in 1982. _ In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, businesswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballasiotes </PERSON> was slain last September by work-release inmate <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, whom psychiatrists had described years earlier as a sexual psychopath, was sentenced to life without _ In <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, a judge gave <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Beets </PERSON>, 29, a 48-hour furlough from a trespass and battery jail sentence to attend the funeral of an aunt Beets now is charged in the March 10 hammering death of <PERSON> Oretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Hames </PERSON>, 71, and the attempted murder of her daughter _ Beets' girlfriend _ <PERSON> Vanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hames </PERSON>, 28 `` Should I punish everyone in the future because this man did something horrible?'' asked Las Vegas Municipal Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who granted the furlough. `` It was a kindness to -LRB- Beets' -RRB- family that turned into a nightmare.'' Prison officials say inmates are carefully screened before furloughs are granted. But murderers are eligible in several states, including <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> rapist won work release and was charged again with rape. A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> murderer was granted weekend passes, although rules forbade it. Even inmates with clean prison records can be unpredictable. `` After all, they are prisoners,'' says <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> prison spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>. `` They have been convicted of crimes against society.'' Some states have clamped down on furloughs and early releases after well-publicized crimes, while others have taken similar steps to avoid borrowing trouble. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tightened furlough rules after the 1987 <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case, choosing not to eliminate either that program or work release. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> implemented tougher policies since <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> was charged. The new standards would have kept <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, who won an exception because he was assigned to the governor's mansion, under guard. The old policy treated furloughs `` as some kind of reward for service within the institution,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` To me, that's not valid.'' <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a psychiatric center, came under criticism when it was revealed one triple murderer had regular furloughs, and a convicted rapist was charged with rape while on work release. Patuxent suspended all furlough and work-release programs in November. Five years ago, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> sharply cut furloughs after two furloughed inmates were charged with a series of rapes in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> Circuit Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, a critic of the program, says he still worries, despite more stringent regulations. `` All I can say is that we have n't recently had a front-page story of a furlough guy committing a crime,'' Peach says. `` I think that's probably luck.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, hoping to strengthen his hand before an upcoming trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is bringing together Jewish leaders from 30 countries Monday in a show of Jewish solidarity. Critics say the meeting of 1,100 Jewish leaders will boost <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hard-line views at a time when many Jews are criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s harsh treatment of rioting Palestinians. The three-day meeting in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is to close at the Western Wall, <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine, with an expected declaration of support for a strong, peace-seeking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It is billed as a non-partisan show of support for the Jewish state rather than for any specific foreign policy line, including <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s refusal to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader plans to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in April and is expected to come under increasing pressure from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to produce new ideas for a peace initiative. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recently launched a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may have no alternative but to reverse its policy and negotiate with the guerrillas it calls terrorists. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, 73, reiterated in an interview published Friday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that he will never talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and rejects giving up the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in exchange for peace _ a concept at the heart of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy. Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader helping to organize the conference, said the meeting will not be used to legitimize or boost <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing positions. <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>'s left-of-center party is a partner in the national unity government headed by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc `` It is not going to be a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> conference; it is not going to be a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> conference. It is going to be a Jewish conference in support of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, of the government of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>, who has no portfolio. Like a small number of other Labor ministers, Gur has publicly supported talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> under certain conditions. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister in charge of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs who is from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, said the conference was called precisely because there are divisions among Israelis and Jews outside the country about the peace process. `` We believe it is important at this particular time to reaffirm solidarity for the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There will not be any specific resolution calling for support for a particular policy line,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has faced mounting international criticism because of harsh methods the army uses to suppress the Palestinian revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, now in its 16th month. At least 395 Palestinians have been killed during the uprising, most from Israeli army gunfire. Seventeen Israelis also have died. Some Jewish circles also are critical. A recent poll conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> showed American Jews still support <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but they are embarrassed by its actions against Palestinian rioters. A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, a New York-based Jewish service organization, said the conference is designed to counter the impression that criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by Jews means they have abandoned support for the state. `` We believe that too many enemies of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ... have mistaken the open communal discussion of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s current difficulties and the legitimate differences within our own community as a withdrawal of our general support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' it says in a statement to be published in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Among leaders expected at the conference are <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, and Rabbi <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, a leader of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Reform Jews Among critics are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, editor of the American liberal Jewish magazine `` Tikkun,'' who charged those gathering in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> will be `` dancing to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s tune,'' and <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, editor of the London-based `` Jewish Quarterly,'' who voiced similar criticism. `` History will judge that the Americans coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next week betrayed the Jewish people when it needed to hear sober words of truth,'' <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 It has been a two-decade off-season for Little League baseball in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, where the crack of the bat has given way to crack cocaine and gun shots. But that is to change April 8, with an Opening Day parade to a city park for four games. `` We're not out trying to grow big-league ballplayers. We're trying to grow big-league citizens,'' says <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Raiford </PERSON>, who along with his wife, <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, is the guiding light behind the renaissance of <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Raiford </PERSON>'s organization already has its charter from the <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, Pa.-based <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year with 7,000 leagues worldwide and 2.5 million youths. The community on the north end of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> is so starved for recreation for its children that <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, which treats growing numbers of youths for stab and gunshot wounds, is lending financial and medical support. `` You can walk out of the hospital at night and hear the ` pop pop pop' of guns,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, the hospital's chief of pediatric surgery. `` A lot of the street-selling of crack is done by youngsters and they're armed. Kids shoot at each other if they get angry or in a fight. With so many violent episodes, it's like war in the streets,'' she said. In <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, one of every 100 children is hospitalized with a serious injury each year, 10 times the national average, the doctor said. And 12 percent of the major injuries to children last year were gunshot wounds, compared with the two children treated for gunshot wounds at the hospital in the 1960s, she said. Frustrated, hospital officials began recreation programs. They considered starting a Little League program themselves but the <ORGANIZATION> Raifords </ORGANIZATION> did it first. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON>, administrator of Little League's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 23, said a <ORGANIZATION> Harlem-Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> started in 1958 but disbanded by about 1970. The reasons are unclear. Mrs. <PERSON> Raiford </PERSON> said she began planning the new league last fall after striking a deal with her 8-year-old son, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>. She would start a league if <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> practiced piano with minimal complaints. She prepared an $ 8,000 budget so as many as 120 boys and girls could play, and recruited sponsors to pay for the teams and equipment for at least one year. Half the kids can not afford a $ 25 fee and others lack gloves, <PERSON> Raiford </PERSON> said, but `` thanks to our sponsors and a strong financial aid program, any kid who ca n't afford the registration fee still plays baseball.'' Formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, one of seven leagues in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, has brought dozens of letters to the <ORGANIZATION> Raifords </ORGANIZATION> and nearly 100 phone calls. `` <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> has its image,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Raiford </PERSON> said. `` When you think of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, you think of it as very cold and people uncaring. But we have seen the best side of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. You read letters and tears come to your eyes.'' One 77-year-old woman on Social Security wrote a letter praising the effort, `` especially with so much drugs and crime out there,'' and promising to send a check, <PERSON> Raiford </PERSON> said. `` I told her to send us her prayers,'' he said. `` I think she did because other people have come through.'' Among the most interested have been the children, including 11-year-old <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Salter </PERSON>. He said he's excited about wearing uniforms `` because you'll be playing and knowing you're playing for fun and you're appreciated.'' Akhnaten Spencer-El, 9, said the ball fields will be a nice alternative to the streets, where `` some people are a little crazy.''

<TEXT>
 Syrian soldiers set up mortars and rocket launchers on rooftops in the Moslem sector Saturday after the commander of the Christian army vowed to drive the Syrian army out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Sporadic artillery fire resounded across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday as Syrian-backed Druse gunners fired into the state-run <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> and Christian residential neigborhoods near the city's dividing Green Line. Police said three people were wounded. The hostilities violated a cease-fire called Thursday to give mediators a chance to end fighting that began 10 days ago, killing 49 people and wounding 164, by police count. The truce was to expire at midnight Saturday. The fighting between Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces began after Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the commander of the Christian army, blockaded illegal ports used by Moslem militias to import supplies. The Syrians on Saturday deployed mortars and rocket launchers atop high-rise apartment buildings in outlying residential districts of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Shiite Moslem southern slums. They apparently were preparing for a resumption of the fighting when the truce ends. The Syrians maintain a 12,000-strong contingent in west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, part of 40,000 troops stationed in north, east and central <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Reliable witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians also were digging artillery gun pits and foxholes and erecting new sandbag positions in and around the southern suburbs. `` You should not panic,'' one Syrian officer told a visibly worried resident while the reinforcements were being brought in. `` We're not going to start any fighting. We are here to protect you.'' However, hundreds of Shiite residents were seen packing luggage, beds and mattresses, and leaving the slums on the outskirts of the capital in cars heading for south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, who requested anonymity, said more than 8,000 Shiites from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have taken refuge with relatives living in areas policed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. `` We do not need a guardian who claims he is protecting us ... while in reality he is killing us, sponging away our wealth and usurping our sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Friday. `` Our option is liberation. We shall fight and use every other means to bring about the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> withdrawal,'' said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, a Maronite Catholic who commands 20,000 mostly Christian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fractured army. His remark was criticized by acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a pro-Syrian official who heads the mainly Moslem cabinet competing for legitimacy with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military cabinet under <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` You are planting war but you are not going to reap any liberation,'' said <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. `` The Syrians are here at the request of legitimate authorities, and their departure can be decided only by a united cabinet.'' Their remarks appeared to dim the chances of an agreement to resolve the latest round of fighting in the 14-year-old civil war.

 Bulldozers and rescue workers searched through rubble Saturday for two teen-age girls feared buried in the collapse of a 900-year-old tower. Two people were killed and 15 injured when the 255-foot tower crumbled onto a square in this northern Italian town Friday morning. The search for the two girls began after they were reported missing by their parents. They had failed to show up for work or return home Friday. Throughout the night, bulldozers, firefighters and volunteer rescue workers dug through the tons of bricks and dirt. Authorities said the clean-up operation would last through the weekend. The tower destroyed a newspaper stand, buried several parked cars and damaged adjoining shops and parts of the adjacent 501-year-old cathedral. Experts said natural decay of the mortar cementing the bricks likely caused the collapse. However, heavy August rains that damaged the church and a recent three-month dry spell that may have weakened ground around the tower are also being considered as possible causes for the collapse. A magistrate was investigating whether negligence was involved. Culture Ministry officials and other departments dealing with preservation of monuments will meet in <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION> next week to examine the causes of the collapse and determine measures for preventing similar incidents.

 With Discovery safely back on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will move forward on its ambitious launch schedule by taking Atlantis to the launch pad Wednesday for an April 28 liftoff with the first space shuttle planetary payload. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, a 7,600-pound spacecraft that resembles a giant insect, will be dispatched by <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' crew for a 466-day outward journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The probe is to orbit the cloud-shrouded planet and map its surface with high-resolution radar. Discovery's successful launch last Monday with a communications satellite was the first of seven shuttle flights planned this year as the space agency continues its recovery from the 1986 Challenger explosion, working toward a flight rate of 12 a year by 1992. Shuttle boss <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> said after Discovery's return from space on Saturday that `` our goal is to fly again and again,'' with safety always a prime consideration. He said Discovery returned in better condition than any other shuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launch schedule. `` It shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is,'' Truly said. It also demonstrates, he said, that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has the capability of flying a busy and safe launch rate. One stumbling block in the shuttle schedule may be the extensive modifications being made to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the first shuttle in the fleet, Truly said. That shuttle's July 1 target launch date with a classified military payload already has slipped about two weeks. Any additional delay could push back another military shuttle flight planned in August, and that could begin impacting the high-priority October launch of Atlantis with the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. `` We want very much to launch <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in July,'' Truly said. `` If not, we'll delay it to meet the Galileo window.'' <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> are high-priority missions because there is only a month or so every two years when their planetary targets are in the proper alignment for a launch. The space agency also is conscious that no American spacecraft has been launched toward the planets since 1978. Here's the present launch schedule for this year: April 28 _ Atlantis, with the Magellan-Venus spacecraft. Mid-July _ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, with a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload. Mid-August _ Discovery with a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload. Oct. 12 _ Atlantis, with the Galileo-Jupiter spacecraft. Nov. 13 _ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, whose crew is to deploy a communications satellite and retrieve for return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> a scientific satellite orbiting since 1984. Dec. 11 _ Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope. Ten flights are scheduled in 1990.

 Discovery's astronauts generally toed the line on a new <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> edict to cut the comedy, at least for public viewing, but they showed some flashes of fun in space, mainly in the battle of wakeup songs. When Discovery made the first post-Challenger flight last September, the five astronauts awoke to Beach Boys music parodies and clowned for television cameras in bright Hawaiian shirts. And even though the December flight of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> was a classified military mission, word leaked of special wakeup music not particularly flattering to the Pentagon. And both crews videotaped themselves playing in the weightlessness of orbit, turning somersaults, throwing a football and feeding each other candy. The tapes were shown at public gatherings. The astronauts' wacky wakeup calls and zany acrobatics got attention, which upset <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> because it felt the reports made the flights look like all play and no work. `` We've learned that if you crack a joke or show somebody doing something funny, that's the 10 seconds that gets on the evening news, and not the two hours worth of work you just showed,'' Discovery commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> said in a pre-launch interview. So space agency officials told Discovery's crew to cool it when the cameras or microphones were on. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has no officia sense of humor anymore,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, one of Coats' crewmates. `` So we're somewhat restricted now on what we can do.'' Discovery's flight started out strictly following the policy, with wakeup calls played by <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> limited to presentations like the Marine hymn, for the two crewmen who are Marines. But on Day 3, things loosened up. The astronauts pre-empted <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> by playing their own wakeup music first _ the theme music from `` Star Trek.'' They followed that with a tape recorded for them by actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>, who gave a brief performance in his character of Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> in the `` Star Trek'' movies and television series. `` Discovery, tell <PERSON> Scotty </PERSON> to beam me up,'' replied capsule communicator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Mission Control then responded with its planned wakeup _ a medley of school songs from the alma maters of the crew members. The next day, the astronauts again were first in the wakeup battle _ broadcasting a recording of `` Hi Ho, <PERSON> Hi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, It's Off To Work We Go,'' the work song of the seven dwarfs in the animated movie classic `` Snow White.'' Mission Control regained the upper hand on the final day, Saturday, hitting the airwaves first with a raucus recording of the astronauts' children shouting such things as, `` Get up, dad, get out of bed and get to work,'' and `` Hi, daddy, this is your darling daughter telling you to wake up.''

 Few residents of this city in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> remember a fair-haired boy named <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who played at his parents' home while his father worked at a local steel mill. But 30 years later, many in the city of 75,000 claim <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> as one of their own as they work to free him from captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The city of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> has a soft spot in its heart for any <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> native,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Andersons are a deep-rooted family here. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s grandfather had a grocery store in south <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, and his dad worked in the steel mills. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He began his fifth year in captivity Thursday. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s parents are dead, but he still has relatives in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, an industrial city 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. The house where <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> lived until he was 6 or 7 years old has been torn down, as has the school where he went to first grade, said <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 78, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s aunt. The family left that house when <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, left the steel mills to work as a truck driver and moved the family to <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, N.Y. While <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> said he is unaware of any <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> resident other than Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> who has seen <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in the past 30 years, that has n't stopped <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> residents from working on <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s behalf. Last Christmas, the committee gathered 28,000 Christmas cards for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> that were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with the hope that the greetings might reach <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Some of them were published in a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper. Every Oct. 28, residents hold a party in honor of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday On March 16 they gather in remembrance of the day he was captured in 1985, <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> said. `` The committee has done a lot of work to keep his name alive,'' said a cousin of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON>, 45, who said she has n't seen him since he moved from <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> `` They've done a lot of work in making him one of our own.'' About 500 people wore yellow ribbons, heard music written in <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s honor and released hundreds of balloons Thursday at City Hall to symbolize their hope that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will be released. More than 100 of those attending were members of six veterans' organizations, said another of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s cousins, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, vice commander of a local Veterans of Foreign Wars post `` If you are a native of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, whether a veteran or not, we would have been there,'' he said. `` But <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s being a Marine and a veteran of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> makes him kind of special.'' <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> native <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacher </PERSON>, who has never met <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, wrote a song called `` We Want You Home Again'' in <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s honor last December. The song, recorded by the <ORGANIZATION> Lorain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>, implores <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s captors to `` listen to our plea and send him home.'' <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> said it has been broadcast by more than 80 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radio stations and by the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> overseas. He said the committee will continue to work to free <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` The main thing is to keep this thing alive. Once we forget the hostages, they'll be gone,'' <PERSON> LaVriha </PERSON> said.

 Rebels say they will not stop Salvadorans from voting in Sunday's presidential election, but none of the voting-age residents in this village of 2,500 plans to cast a ballot. `` No one here believes in this election,'' said <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>, a local leader of this town, which was repopulated in 1987 after being abandoned for seven years. `` This election is to prolong the war,'' said a man who identified himself only as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>. No love is lost between this town in <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. His administration and its army consider this, like others revived by people returning from refugee camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, as hostile territory. In an interview, a local rebel commander known only as `` Antolin'' said under no circumstances would voters be targets in the guerrilla campaign to discredit the elections. But no election was scheduled in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION>, where sympathies clearly lie with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> front, which has waged a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government. The rebels have called for an election boycott to prove that a political solution is impossible without their participation. Every day from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., radios in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> are tuned to the rebels' Radio <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>. Women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee before heading to the fields. On one morning this week, all listened to a radio account of overnight attacks on `` the puppet army'' and admonishments that every Salvadoran do his part to prepare for insurrection. Guerrillas are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice. Government soldiers, on their rare appearances, are shunned. `` The soldiers three times set fire to the cornfields around here,'' said <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>. `` The last time they came through, a few went up to people and told them, ` Just wait until <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> is in power. We'll be back with a bomb for every house.''' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, is expected to win Sunday's election. In its campaign, <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> has taken a hard line on the war, threatening a military solution. In an attempt to disrupt voting on Sunday, rebels announced a transportation strike that government officials said paralyzed more than 90 percent of the nation's transport services. Rebels also sabotaged utilities leaving much of the nation without power or water for the past five days. The government has said soldiers will be stationed at polls to guarantee voter safety. `` We will attack military objectives in the countryside, in the cities and on the roads. But the people will never become a military target,'' <PERSON> Antolin </PERSON> said from his mountain stronghold. `` If civilians are killed or wounded, they will be victims of rightist terrorists trying to make us look bad,'' he said. But <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> and at least 23 other rebel-controlled towns residents were to follow the rebel lead and boycott polls Sunday. Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrarte </PERSON>, provincial military commander, said support for the guerrillas was firmly entrenched in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION>. `` The subversives count on them for supplies, recruitment and rest,'' he said. `` They portray us only as murderers, violators of human rights, ogres.'' An estimated 20,000 Salvadorans were driven from their homes by the war, aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s. Since October 1987, about 6,500 have returned. `` When we came back, this was just woods and brush,'' said <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>. `` Every house had been burned, and the fields were overgrown.'' Now many people are enlarging their homes and working cooperative farms. `` Because of the war, there are lots of widows and orphans here,'' said <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>. `` If we were n't a cooperative, those people would die.''

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has joined other federal health officials in trying to assure the public it is safe for children to eat apples. `` I wish to send a message to mothers across the country: ` It's OK Mom, apples are good for your kids!' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said in a statement released by his office over the weekend. Last week, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> went to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in an effort to calm public fears over the chemical Alar, used by some apple growers to retain the crispness of their fruit. Many apple growers say they do n't use Alar, which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. But the industry is reeling from reaction to a recent a private environmental group's report that youngsters are at especially high risk from Alar because they eat so many more apples than adults. Many parents are reported to have stopped giving apples to their children and some school districts are no longer serving apples in their cafeterias. Trying to allay their fears, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said that `` in 1988, only 5 percent of the apple crop was treated with Alar.'' `` As Surgeon General, I support my colleagues in the federal government and scientific community in the belief that it is safe to eat apples,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has said that, even in those apples containing Alar, the level is no more than 10 percent the level found acceptable under <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. Public furor over the Alar controversy was intensified last week by the unrelated ban of fruit from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> because two grapes were found to have been injected with cyanide.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature opens its annual meeting Monday, and some observers expect a tough fight between delegates calling for democratic change and government officials stressing stability. The government argues that it needs stability to solve <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pressing economic problems Many intellectuals say the economic problems will persist unless the government relaxes tight political controls. Pro-democratic forces are expected to continue an open-letter campaign, urging an amnesty for political prisoners and respect for human rights. Since January, four such letters have been sent, signed by more than 100 leading intellectuals. The last letter was sent last week, despite threats of punishment by government officials. Delegates also said they expected the issue of human rights to be raised at the congress itself, an unprecedented act of defiance. `` It will be a lively time,'' said one Communist Party member. `` Intellectuals will push as far as they can go.'' Government officials have ordered the state-run media to censor reports of disagreements at the 2,796-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and portray the delegates as united, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources said And the restrictions are apparently not limited to the domestic press. On Friday night, Chinese authorites interrogated two Taiwanese journalists after they had interviewed a delegate. Two teams of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> reporters were also stopped from talking with delegates. <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhichao </PERSON>, a government spokesman, apologized for the incidents, but he said he could not assure it would not happen again. `` It will be a step back from last year,'' said one delegate. During last year's congress, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news media was allowed to report some disagreements between delegates as part of the state's attempt at openness. The government has been emphasizing that it needs stability to solve <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s weighty economic problems. By doing so, party sources said, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to persuade wavering delegates that it's best to remain quiet and follow the government line. In an attempt at conciliation, the government has announced it will appoint more members of democratic parties to government positions. The first appointments were made Friday when <ORGANIZATION> non-Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members were appointed vice-minister of labor and vice-minister of agriculture. Delegates said the appointments will be made to present an image of democracy and to take some of the blame off the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for failed policies. `` But it will fail,'' said one party member. `` All the delegates know that the ` democratic' parties are even more communist than the Communist Party.'' The congress is also expected to pass some laws, two of which are critical to the reform of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political system. One law gives civilians the right to sue the government. It has been criticized by liberal thinkers because it does not acknowledge that the government can break the law. But moderates have hailed it as a step in the right direction. Another law delineates the powers of the congress, an important step in reforms designed to separate the functions of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from the government. The congress opens against a backdrop of serious political and economic problems. Inflation is running at a record 36 percent. Grain harvests have been below target for the past five years. Electricity is in scarce supply. Steel production has dropped. Salt and cotton are hard to buy. Corruption among government officials and party members appears at an all time high. Newspapers are filled with reports of official malfeasance.

<TEXT>
 For Tibetans, this is a place of crushed hopes and cherished dreams, a sanctuary far from the Chinese who now rule their homeland and close to their spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, himself an exile for 30 years. High in the Himalayan foothills of north <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, with big brown monkeys scampering across slate roofs and shaggy little terriers yapping in muddy streets, <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION> is a way station for <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists who fled from the Chinese, a storehouse of Tibetan culture, a shrine for <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> pilgrims and a center for plotting political strategies. <PERSON> Sonam </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobgyal </PERSON>, a 47-year-old man with hard eyes and a network of scars across his thumbs and knuckles, left <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> six weeks ago because he thought the Chinese were on the verge of arresting him for pro-independence activities. It was not fear of prison that made him leave, he said, but fear of torture that might cause him to betray others who were not yet under suspicion for organizing demonstrations or slipping information to foreign travelers. `` I was getting known by the Chinese. One of my friends was arrested,'' he said, seated in the sunshine on a rooftop terrace. `` I had to escape.'' <PERSON> Tobgyal </PERSON> said he knew about torture from the 11 years he had already spent in Chinese prisons in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Speaking through an interpreter, he said the scars on his hands were the result of beatings with wooden clubs and iron bars and being suspended by his thumbs from the ceiling for 15 minutes to an hour at a time. He said he was released from prison in 1979 and started peddling clothing from village to village, a job that enabled him to spread news of upcoming anti-Chinese demonstrations. <PERSON> Dekey </PERSON> is a rosy-cheeked, angelic-faced 2-year-old who hugs strangers exuberantly and demands to be cuddled. She was brought to <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lhoka </LOCATION>, a town in southern <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, a year ago by a mother who returned home to the rest of her family and may never see <PERSON> Dekey </PERSON> again. <PERSON> Dekey </PERSON> is one of 1,449 children between the ages of 5 months and 18 years who live in the stone bungalows at the Tibetan Children's Village on a ridge above <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION> Some are orphans. Others have parents, either in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> who for reasons of health or poverty are unable to care for their children, or in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> who smuggled them out so that they might be brought up in the Tibetan culture they say is being stifled by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The children's village, like so many things in <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> Memory Restaurant to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s Namgyal Monastery, is dedicated to preserving Tibetan identity and _ above all _ the struggle for a Tibetan nation. The Tibetans say they were never part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which invaded the Himalayan feudal theocracy in 1950 and annexed it a year later. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an integral part of its territory for centuries. Three decades ago a Tibetan uprising failed. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, fearing he would be killed or captured and his people left leaderless, slipped out of the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> on March 17, 1959, and fled across the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where 100,000 Tibetans now live. He formed a government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION>, home to about 7,000 of his fellow refugees. In June, he offered <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> control over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign policy and the right to keep troops on Tibetan soil in exchange for allowing <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> to become `` a self-governing democratic political entity ... in association with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The Chinese rejected the proposal but said they were willing to talk to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, although formal negotiations have not begun. It is a measure of Tibetans' faith in the Dalai Lama that many people still believe he will win total freedom for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, although the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> leader has said repeatedly, as he did again in an interview last Thursday: `` I am trying to find a middle way. We are not insisting on complete independence.'' <PERSON> Nima </PERSON> <PERSON> Assae </PERSON>, a 51-year-old former resistance fighter who was captured by the Chinese in 1961 and imprisoned for nearly two decades, is one of the believers. `` I have full faith that the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> will gain our independence. The Chinese will not be able to terminate the Tibetans,'' he said.

<HEAD>Secretary of State Wants U.S. Envoy to Afghan Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> favors sending a special envoy to the Afghan rebels battling the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime as a means of broadening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence among the long-feuding rebel factions, administration officials said Saturday. `` It is under consideration,'' a White House official said of the proposal. The official, who spoke on condition his name not be used, said the proposal `` is still on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s desk'' and has not reached President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` may be close to a decision point'' on the matter, the official said. One <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who also spoke privately, said the proposal has been `` under consideration for a long time,'' but said he was uncertain of the potential timing for a decision. The first official emphasized that the move would not imply <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of any interim government established by the rebels, also known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. He confirmed the move is aimed at limiting <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s influence among the Afghan guerrillas, in particular it's backing of radical Moslem fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions. Throughout the war, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has funneled aid to the rebels through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help fight an insurgency that began after a communist coup in 1978. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew under an agreement mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. In recent weeks, the Soviet-backed Afghan government has been battling a renewed offensive by the Moslem rebels in the wake of the mid-February withdrawal of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 115,000 soldiers. But last week the Soviets renewed arms shipments to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, saying they will continue to supply equipment to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops as long as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supply the guerrillas. Civil war has ravaged <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for more than 11 years and divisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting. The seven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle for power as they attempt to form a transitional regime leading to a postwar Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Last year, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, pushed a law through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that required the appointment of a special ambassador, but former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> only named a lower-ranking envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to fill the post. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> renewed the call for a higher-level appointment in a bipartisan resolution. The resolution, which was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not cut the amount of military equipment it gives the Afghan guerrillas until it is `` absolutely clear'' that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has ended its assistance to its proxies. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, authored the resolution, which was signed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>.,

<TEXT>
 Bringing philosophers, writers and psychologists together to ponder the roots of hatred is not naive, it's a necessity in this era of plastic explosives, skinheads and the furor over `` The Satanic Verses,'' organizers of a new program say. `` Anatomy of Hate,'' a three-day seminar scheduled to begin Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, will tackle some tough questions and diverse subjects _ from the threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his novel to the January riots in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` That's a very strong word _ hatred,'' said Nobel Prize-winning humanitarian <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, whose foundation organized the event. `` Usually, all the conferences are for love and for compassion, and I wanted to name the disease. `` And the disease is simple, concrete and conjugal, and it's here, all around us That's why I begin with the anatomy of hatred, to explore it, to analyze it, to dissect it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Elie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION> has tentative plans to hold other `` Beyond Hate'' gatherings this year and next year in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A PBS series with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> as host is also in the works. The foundation cites several positive events last year, the cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran War, dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviets, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, international cooperation in rushing aid to earthquake-torn <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> But it also gives an example of violent hatred for every one of a good event: _ The bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, four days before Christmas _ Ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> _ The escalation of assaults and vandalism by racist `` skinhead'' groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ Continuing strife between Roman Catholics and Protestants in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> `` To ask why hate continues in the face of humanitarian cooperation and political understanding is neither naive nor utopian,'' the foundation said in a statement. `` It is a necessity.'' `` In a world where global annihilation lies seconds away and the technology of destruction, whether plastic explosives or nerve gas, is readily available to a handful of extremists, the costs of hatred are too high for the subject of hate not to be a topic of the highest concern.'' More than 25 professors, writers, psychologists and peace advocates are scheduled to participate in the forum, including <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, the daughter of slain Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>. One of the participants, <PERSON> Krister </PERSON> <PERSON> Stendahl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said the religious aspect of hatred is a particularly delicate issue. `` Religion is a very dangerous thing,'' <PERSON> Stendahl </PERSON> said. `` These are enormous powers we are dealing with. My tasks are to ask why there has been this dark side.'' People who tend to see the world `` in a strongly adverse, antagonistic form,'' <PERSON> Stendahl </PERSON> said, can `` easily play into the hands of the patterns of hatred. The Arabic-Hebrew word ` shalom' does n't actually mean ` peace,' it means ` harmony. That's a non-hateful image.'' <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> 60 years ago, was deported along with his family to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp when he was 15. His mother and sister died there. He and his father were transferred to <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION>, where his father died before the camp was liberated in 1945. <PERSON> Weisel </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for his international work to foster human rights. He is the author of more than 30 books and is a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said he hopes the seminars will explore the conditions that transform negative attitudes into destructive behavior. `` How do you start to educate people? Without the education, the hatred in the world has produced more hatred,'' he said. `` We will try to explore all aspects -LRB- of hatred -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON> said. `` With the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair, it is very topical. The fanaticism mounting, with the head of a world religion hiring hitmen, it's just unheard-of. It's what hate can do.''

<HEAD>Chile Resumes Fruit Exports, Braces for Economic Crunch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Troops stood guard Saturday as <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> resumed fruit exports after a poisoning scare caused a five-day stoppage that idled thousands of workers and may cost the nation up to $ 1 billion, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION> port, said two ships were being loaded with 700,000 crates of grapes, apples, pears and kiwis. He said navy troops were deployed around the clock to watch over the shipments and access to the port was tightly controlled. Twelve more ships were to be loaded over the weekend, the officer said. The shipments ended a public health scare that began Monday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health officials said they found traces of cyanide on two Chilean grapes in the port of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But on Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lifted consumer warnings on Chilean produce, announcing tougher security measures. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which had issued similar warnings, followed suit. Chilean authorities said economic effects of the virtual embargo would be felt for years to come. The industry, which employs 500,000 workers and accounts for 10 percent of the nation's exports, may lose up to $ 1 billion, government officials said. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliu </PERSON>, president of the nation's largest business association, said <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> had already lost $ 200 million, while authorities said 200,000 fruit industry workers were laid off. The government on Friday announced economic measures to combat the crisis, including a subsidized advertising campaign in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> designed to regain consumer confidence. Other measures included a $ 12 million emergency job program, emergency credit lines to fruit exporters and producers and the purchase of 1 million crates of stocked fruit. Under new security measures taking effect Monday, army patrols were to be posted in fruit fields and at packing houses and police were to step up security checks on trucks carrying produce to ports, <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> said. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also were to join Chilean colleagues in reinforcing sanitary controls in ports and fruit packing plants. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, health officials were to step up spot checks of Chilean produce. Initial checks of Chilean fruit were made after embassies in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> received anonymous threats that fruit from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation would be poisoned. The government attributed the calls to leftist terrorists.

 Two weeks into a strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, organized labor has succeeded beyond expectations in crippling the carrier but has not, for a number of reasons, carried out pre-strike threats to disrupt the rest of the nation's transportation system Support from the airline's pilots gave striking Machinists an early and impressive boost in their bitter war with Eastern management, and other unions have been equally impressive in their support of the strikers, principally through attendance at rallies and donations to strike funds. But as the strike enters its third week _ with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> all but grounded and mired in bankruptcy court _ even many labor leaders agree that their nemesis, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, is the early winner because he is losing less money per day now on Eastern than he was before the strike But they say the lasting verdict is not yet in, and that the strike has given labor's morale a much-needed boost. `` The strike is holding firm and I think it's a great show of solidarity,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. `` The future of this airline under bankruptcy proceedings is largely uncharted waters. But this man had this company on the rocks, and when you're on the rocks, uncharted waters look much better.'' Unions representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers marked the two week point of the walkout Saturday with a rally across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, chiding President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not intervening to block the strike and promising continued solidarity. `` Our resolve is rock solid and so are our picket lines,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which along with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants union has been honoring pickets of striking Machinists. As labor prepared for the strike, which began when 8,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> walked off the job March 4, its plans included major disruptions of other airlines and railroads through secondary pickets it believed would be honored by union workers. But those efforts have been stymied by court injunctions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> prohibiting other unions from honoring pickets of Eastern workers. They are appealing those rulings, but labor leaders have not pressed further boycotts because they do not want to endanger the public support the strikers have garnered. `` Everything we've done to date is legal, and I think the public appreciates that and has been on our side,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, concurred with that view. `` If the unions had immediately succeeded in getting sympathy strikes going and disrupting things I think the public might have turned against the unions,'' <PERSON> Bensman </PERSON> said. `` Labor now has made its case and painted <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as an irresponsible employer. I think that has left labor in a strong position with the public if the strike is expanded in the future.'' For now, labor's goal is to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> virtually grounded _ the airline has been able to fly roughly 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights _ while pursuing a possible employee-led buyout of the company and drafting a union reorganization plan to counter any proposal <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> submits to the bankruptcy court. Labor's efforts so far have won praise from outsiders who follow the movement, particularly iteling more powerful leads you to act more powerfully,'' said <PERSON> Bensman </PERSON>. `` It seems to me what has happened so far has been about as good as the unions could have expected.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been aided by the bankruptcy filing, the unions concede, because it has stopped a financial drain on cash-poor Eastern that was $ 1 million a day before the strike and several times that in the days immediately following the walkout. `` In many ways he's already won,'' said <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>. `` He's taken hundreds of million in assets from this airline and transferred them to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>.'' But union leaders are encouraged by indications <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is trying to sell the airline and by polls and other indications public support is with the striking workers, who hope anti-Lorenzo sentiment will affect non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which has been losing money nearly as fast as Eastern. <PERSON> Bensman </PERSON> said labor also has sent a powerful message throughout the airline industry, where workers at several carriers have been forced to accept wage concessions in recent years. `` If <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had succeeded here in splitting the Machinists from the pilots and then imposing harsh concessions, it would have sent the green light to management at other airlines,'' he said. `` Labor has strengthened its position in the industry as a whole.'' Peripheral to the strike itself has been a related political debate and, much like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s ultimate fate, the ramifications of the strike in that context remain unclear. By refusing to block the walkout by naming an emergency mediation board, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has soured his relations with labor. Congressional Democrats, who benefit heavily from labor's political warchest, are pushing legislation that would force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene but do not appear to have the votes to override a veto. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` siding with a pirate'' by refusing to intervene but said it was too soon to discuss the long-term impact the strike would have on labor's relations with the new administration. `` I'm still hopeful better judgment will prevail.''

 Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Saturday demanded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> halt joint military exercises and accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of staging simulated nuclear attacks with B-52 bombers on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied North Korean charges as propaganda. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are believed to have nuclear weapons, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has declined to confirm or deny such reports. Students in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> battled police with firebombs and rocks Saturday to demand an end to the `` Team Spirit'' exercises and an immediate withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Riot police fired tear gas to drive back about 800 protesters at <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and about 400 students at <ORGANIZATION> Dongguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital. Protesters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> burned an <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, shouting `` Yankee go home!'' and `` Drive out <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. forces!'' Also Saturday, millions of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> commuters were stranded for a third day as many subway workers remained on strike. North Korean delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was using nine B-52 bombers from bases in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> to stage practice nuclear attacks in South Korean areas that resemble potential targets in the communist North. The <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which meets at the border site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, polices the truce that ended the Korean war in 1953. About 200,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops are taking part in the 14th annual exercises, which began Tuesday and end next week. `` Team Spirit'' practices bringing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reinforcements in the event of a North Korean attack. About 42,000 American soldiers are normally stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. North Korean officials said the exercises were a threat to peace on the divided peninsula and barrier to peace talks. `` You should desist from attempting to justify your aggressive acts and discontinue at once the criminal war exercise ... blocking the way to detent and dialogue by leading the situation to the brink of war,'' said North Korean Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ui </PERSON> Ung. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Rear Admiral <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the military exercises were purely defensive and vital to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s security `` Your side's continued military build up, forward deployment of forces and secret military maneuvers, all directed against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, cause serious concern that your side may be preparing for another act of aggression,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has charged that Team Spirit is part of preparations for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on its territory and demanded the exercises be stopped. The exercises this year stalled talks between the two Koreas on improving relations. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has not said if it would be willing to resume the talks after the exercises end. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> represents the 16 nations that sent troops to defend <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> against a 1950 North Korean attack. <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials said about 80 percent of the subway's 7,732 workers reported to work Saturday, but many refused to do anything, ignoring a warning that they faced disciplinary action.

 The supersecret <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the construction of its own computer chip manufacturing plant, defense officials said Saturday. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that `` in September 1988 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> received an $ 85 million contract to construct and operate a microelectronics facility for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government over a period of 45 months.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, confirmed that the plant was to be built at the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, located about halfway between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's biggest intelligence agency, with a work force topping 60,000 employees _ more than all other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy agencies combined _ and a budget said to be upwards of $ 10 billion a year. Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the globe, encrypting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications and cracking foreign codes, as well as safeguarding the security of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers and communications systems. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>, an authority on the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>, has reported that computers cover more than 5 -LCB- acres at the agency's headquarters complex. The <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s basement, which stretches for city blocks, `` undoubtedly holds the largest and most advanced computer operation in the world,'' <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON> wrote in his 1982 book, `` The Puzzle Palace.'' The Baltimore Sun quoted <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coady </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for National Semiconductor, based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as saying that in addition to building the computer chip plant `` we will also train government personnel in the operation of the facility.'' She declined to say when construction might start or how many people were expected to work at the plant. The Sun also quoted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilmeier </PERSON>, senior vice president and chief technical officer of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, as saying that the new plant would be `` a unique facility with a unique purpose.'' By making its own chips at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, he said, the government gains more direct control, circumvents the bidding process on essential microchips and increases plant security.

<HEAD>Thousands March Against Basque Separatist Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of people marched through this northern city in the Spanish Basque region Saturday, demanding an end to Basque separatist violence, news reports said. Spanish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the crowd stretched out more than 1 -LCB- miles along the march route through the center of <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>. The independent SER network estimated the throng of marchers at `` nearly 300,000.'' Police declined to give crowd estimates. Representatives of the six major political parties representing 83 percent of the Basque electorate headed the demonstration, carrying a banner reading `` Peace Now and Forever,'' calling on the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> to lay down its arms. On Friday <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardanza </PERSON>, head of the autonomous Basque regional government, called on the Basque separatist group to extend indefinitely a cease-fire the separatists first declared Jan. 8 and renewed 15 days later to extend through March 26, Easter Sunday. ETA, an acronym for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language, has killed more than 600 people in its 20-year violent campaign to secure independence for the three-province Spanish Basque country known as <PERSON> Euskadi </PERSON>. `` We have come here today also to make clear our clear desire for reconciliation,'' <PERSON> Ardanza </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want a divided, conflictive society. We do n't want victors or vanquished.'' There were no reports of incidents during the march that was supported by organizations ranging from leftist trade unions to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. On Jan. 15, the government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> resumed talks in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> with exiled <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> `` Antxon'' Etxeveste in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in an attempt to get <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> to give up its weapons. It was not immediately clear what impact the march might have on the cease-fire or the talks. Political observers interpreted wide support shown for the march as a symbol of the growing public rejection of separatist terrorism since the major Basque parties in the Basque regional parliament signed a pact against terrorism on Jan. 19, 1988.

<TEXT>
 Calling himself `` The Love Chef,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> set up shop on a restaurant balcony and proceeded to tell and show people how to prepare romantic fare. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was one of more than 60 author-chefs who converged on <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> this weekend to show off their special dishes and the books they've written about them. `` You have to have a lot of love when you cook,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> told his dining audience Thursday, stressing the added touches, such as cloth napkins and flowers, which he said are just as important as the food. It's all part of The Book and The Cook, an annual promotion sponsored by the city and the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Convention and <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The city is alone in its approach, but backers say others are planning their own versions. The promotion is a chance to spotlight the city's restaurant scene, which has grown considerably in the past 10 years. The show began in 1985 with 22 author-cooks and restaurants participating. A visiting chef collaborates with a restaurants to come up with a dish not normally found on the menu. `` They were skeptical, both the authors and the restaurants,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> of the city representatives office. Not to mention the patrons. But the tradition was started and now, each March, diners can go to their favorite restaurant for something out of the ordinary for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It has been a success each year since the first one, Ms. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> said. `` We do have to turn down authors and also restaurants,'' she said. The prices for the special meals range from $ 5 to over $ 100. Literature listing locations and chefs rates the menus with dollar signs. One $ means the cost will range from $ 5 to $ 15, two calls for a range of $ 15 to $ 25, etc, on up to five dollar signs, which is more than $ 100 per person. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, who in addition to writing has appeared on television in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and on radio around the country, appeared at Babe's Steakhouse in northeast <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> His approach to cooking was the element matched him to Babe's, which bills itself as the place to `` Come back to romance.'' Patrons found not only a book and a cook, but music as well. In between adding ingredients, he sang `` Is n't it romantic?'' In the background, the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesterhazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trio </PERSON> played romantic music. Diner <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who quickly wrote down recipes during the show, said later she planned to cook the Veal <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> and <PERSON> Banana </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amore </PERSON> that he demonstrated. `` It'll be a matter of experimenting,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said she had been wanting to try the restaurant, which opened six months ago, and The Book and The <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> gave her an added incentive. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> said she knows of no other city that has anything similar to The Book and The Cook. `` We do have the mix,'' she said. The range is not only according to price, but in foods. Choices include baked goods, wines, pastas, seafood and food prepared in a microwave. Besides restaurants, other weekend locations include three of the city's museums and a marina at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s Landing.

<TEXT>
 A year before <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> were executed for spying, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> did a lithograph of the couple to raise money for their legal defense. Dozens of artists since then have been moved by the life and death of the <PERSON> Rosenbergs </PERSON>, who in 1953 became the only Americans ever executed for espionage after they refused to confess to helping the Soviets get atomic bomb secrets and were convicted of conspiracy. A collection of 59 works by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and other artists, from the 1950s to the 1980s, is touring the country in an exhibition titled, `` Unknown Secrets: Art and the <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> Era.'' `` There's still an ongoing controversy. There are still questions,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ploog </PERSON>, assistant curator at <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, where the show was scheduled to open Sunday in the fourth of its nine stops. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, who organized the exhibit, said that even though the <PERSON> Rosenbergs </PERSON> were arrested nearly 40 years ago, a number of galleries and museums balked at showing the controversial works. `` I did have more difficulty placing the show than I thought,'' he said. In a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said he began looking for art relating to the <ORGANIZATION> Rosenbergs </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, with a half-dozen names supplied by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeropol </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosenbergs </ORGANIZATION>' two sons who is a friend of <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>'s. `` The artwork of the <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> era serves as a visual diary of one of the most horrific political events of the 1950s,'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> wrote in a book that accompanies the exhibit. `` I wanted to raise the issue that artists can effectively address social and political issues in their art and have it be good art,'' he said. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> found art relating to the <PERSON> Rosenbergs </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ all of it sympathetic to the couple. He also asked contemporary artists to do new works about the couple. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s lithograph is a simple, flattering dual portrait of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosenbergs </ORGANIZATION>. But most of the other works in the exhibition are more directly political, portraying the couple as scapegoats or martyrs, or as an example of an unjust government. French artist <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> Leger </PERSON>'s 1952 silkscreen `` Liberty, Peace, Solidarity,'' shows the <PERSON> Rosenbergs </PERSON> with a dove between them. In <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s 1987 work `` In Memory of <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>,'' two goat skulls hang on a canvas shaped in the Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag fills the canvas and covers the goat heads. In <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>'s 1987 `` Era After Era'' pictures of events such as a <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> rally and an atomic bomb explosion are placed on a map of the world where they occurred. A picture of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosenbergs </ORGANIZATION> is placed above <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said he could not find any art that was not sympathetic to the couple. `` My personal opinion is that they were framed, that they were the most severely treated victims of a dark time in our history,'' he said. <PERSON> Meeropol </PERSON>, who was 6 when his parents were executed and is now an attorney in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said they continue to evoke strong images because they never confessed. `` Their refusal is what made them powerful,'' he said. After the exhibit closes here, it will travel to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, opening June 8; Installation Gallery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, Sept. 8; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Jewish Community Museum, Jan. 7, 1990; <ORGANIZATION> Spertus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaica </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, May 21, 1990; and <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, Sept. 20, 1990.

<TEXT>
 A former supermarket clerk trying to rise to fame with a sport called `` <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Bowling'' that he says he invented has ruffled some feathers at the company that sells Butterball brand turkeys. Executives at Chicago-based Swift-Eckrich are mad because every time <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> shows up on television to `` bowl'' a frozen turkey at 2-liter plastic soda bottles, his bird of choice is a 12-pound Butterball. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who thought up the pastime one night while stocking turkeys at a supermarket, has demonstrated turkey bowling on national television, including the syndicated `` Arsenio Hall Show'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sunday Morning.'' But <PERSON> Swift-Eckrich </PERSON> told <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in a terse, four-paragraph letter last month to stop using its turkeys because it `` damages the Butterball quality image that we have spent millions of dollars to develop.'' The company threatened <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> with a lawsuit and said it may seek a court order to force him to quit using Butterballs and may also seek damages. But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 29, a former <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rams </ORGANIZATION> cheerleader and Chippendales' nightclub dancer, refuses to abandon turkey bowling. `` No way!'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Friday. `` This is my ticket into the big time. If Swift-Eckrich wants me to stop, all they have to do is write me a check. Better yet, why do n't they hire me as their <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> spokesman. Apparently, I've done more to spread their name and reputation than all their high-priced PR guys.'' `` People ask why I do n't use another turkey,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Listen, I love Butterballs. That's all we had when I was growing up. Let's just say I am a loyal customer.'' He said he is too busy promoting his sport and himself to worry about a lawsuit. He said he already has endorsements from a sportswear and shoe company. He also is working with a local market to put on `` Grocery Games,'' to raise money to buy food for the homeless. `` This is the sport of the'90s,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I can see it now. The party invitation will read: ` BYOB _ Bring Your Own Bird.'''

 The White House family has six new members, after a `` beautiful'' delivery by first dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> that brought a tear to the eyes of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday. The president, who joined his wife to watch one of the six puppies delivered, described the experience Saturday as `` really beautiful, it was unbelievable.'' Asked if it was the first delivery he had witnessed, he replied, `` Yes, first dog delivery.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, putting her arm around the president's waist, indicated he had not seen any children born either. The president made the comments when he was walking from the Oval Office and happened upon a small group of reporters who were chatting with his wife, accompanied by <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, in a corridor of the White House. `` The president and I cried when we saw one of them being born ... We had a tear. It was really sweet,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It was so beautiful to see her.'' All of the puppies were described as `` nursing vigorously'' from <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, and the first dog appeared in good spirits, padding around at her masters' feet. `` They're wonderful. They're really cute,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that it had been an easy delivery. While Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played midwife, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> `` did all the work,'' she said. `` She was wonderful. She knew exactly what to do.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the first couple would not keep a puppy, but that one had already been promised to grandchild <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 2, who was at the White House with her parents <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday. When prompted, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> imitated the squeaking noise made by the puppies. Another pup was promised to the twin daughters of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> George </PERSON> who lives in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They're really lovely looking puppies,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They're all really beautiful.'' The litter included a `` big white girl'' and a female runt that has a little triangle on her back. The Bushes' English springer spaniel gave birth to her six-puppy litter over a five-hour period Friday night and early Saturday morning. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> deliver the puppies, while President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had jokingly complained on Friday about being forced out of his bedroom to make room for <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, lent `` moral support,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wound up not having to sleep down the hall because all the puppies were delivered by early Saturday morning. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> several times Saturday, and spent time with the puppies during the day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who spent the day meeting <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and advisers, and playing tennis, also visited their nursery, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> beauty salon which was remade for the new family. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who the president said had been increasingly nervous about the coming birth, `` feels more comfortable now,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. `` Millie is apparently a very good mother,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> added. `` The puppies started nursing immediately. Mom and babies and midwife are doing fine.'' The puppies will live in the White House residential quarters for up to six weeks, and are all promised to new owners after that. The word of impending delivery came about 9 p.m. Friday as the Bushes entertained a group of guests for a movie, `` New York Stories,'' in the White House theater following dinner. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slipped out and, `` At the end of the movie, the president announced we had two puppies and more on the way,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself `` was in on one birth, lending moral support,'' and he brought a folding mattress to the delivery room for Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she said. The puppies were born in a wooden whelping box decorated with the presidential seal. <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>'s mate was Tug III, a springer spaniel owned by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s friend, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, who also gave them <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> Tug III lives at <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s End Farm in <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. On Friday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disclosed that the first lady had informed him he would be sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom, alone, to make way for <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> who would rather sleep in the master bedroom than the beauty salon, which had been converted into a nursery for her Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> `` had a very bad night last night, thrashing around.''

 <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> gave the starring role to enormous soft collars and corolla shapes in his winter ready-to-wear show Saturday that was an exercise in restrained beauty. This influential designer switches gears regularly, moving from football shoulders to pyramid shapes but switching to soft lines in winter collections. The clothes were not very feminine. But in just a few perfect shades and fabrics, they were so well constructed that the fashion world took notice. For the early 1990s, futuristic <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> kicked off with a line of every imaginable subtle shade of blue, pairing slim `` petrol'' blue cuffed pants with glacier or deep blue belted peignoir tulip-wrapped coats. The collars were outsized and oval or flounced in waves down the front. Sleeves were often flared like bluebells. The most amazing toppers here _ also in everything from sky or ice blue to aqua or spotted like ocelot _ were in dyed sheared mink. It looked like iridescent plush, and appeared in handsome hooded boleros, ponchos or puffy shrugs. Besides the important collar styles, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> also went in for a tiny-busted silhouette with a swelling around the hips, which he dubbed a `` peanut'' shape, a sort of weird variation on the redingote coat or jacket. Skirts did n't appear often, but when they did they were long and straight, worn with tights in matching shades. Browns from mahogany to peanut and charcoal or black with suggestions of other shades like green or rust completed the low-keyed color palette. Japanese designer <PERSON> Issey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyake </PERSON> as usual was interested in sculpting or shaping his fabrics in outfits that ended up looking more like art than clothes. His `` zig-zag'' line of brown or blue knits turned out with pleated and pointed effects. He gave stiffened square outlines and collars to some of his long raincoats, and the hats were folded into points to look like paper gliders. This time his synthetic silk, Chinese lantern-pleated fabric was molded so that the models moved along jerkily like automatons. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON> turned to the past for his inspiration, but it was nothing baroque or fancy, choosing rather the sleek vein of <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>. He began with a nice line of clothes inspired by <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>'s film `` Queen <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>.'' In heather and misty blue plaids, knickers and long pants were topped by loose and long vests or short coats with natural shoulders. Full and long tweed skirts under full double-caped short coats had a nice easy trapeze style. The low-key but wearable day clothes also featured good cable-knit twin sets with sandy tweed pants, off-white jackets with paisley linings, soft jersey pants suits in teal, taupe and rust. Things were a lot more feminine at <ORGANIZATION> Balenciaga </ORGANIZATION>, as the designer <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goma </PERSON> featured a lot of dressy evening wear. He offset the autumnal shades and androgynous tendencies seen in the rest of the day's shows with a screaming-hot line of red taffeta lace and chiffon.

<HEAD>Protesters Say Hunters Slaughtering Even More Seals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hundred animal lovers demonstrated Saturday against the slaughter of baby seals off <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>'s north coast, saying it is worse now than when it was made illegal in 1982. Hunters have shifted their sights to pups older than nine days since the 1982 legislation prohibited killing of `` white coats'' _ seals under that age, said a spokesman for demonstrators from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, who marched peacefully around <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building. `` That makes it even worse,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> that organized the protest. `` Where the ` white coats' were taken on the pan ice around the north shore of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and just about all that were killed were harvested, the hunt now is mainly at sea where it's estimated three pups have to be killed for every one got into the boats. `` Now it's on the open seas where it is almost impossible to regulate. There are n't any inspectors or scientists out there. Nobody knows what's going on,'' he said. The harvest, which bottomed out at 20,000 seals a year right after the legislation was enacted, since has risen to 80,000, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said. He also said the government issues 9,000 licenses a season to hunt seals, compared to 5,000 before the legislation. The government quota for this season is 186,000 harp seals and 2,340 hooded seals, he said. `` We thought we had won in 1982, and so did everyone else,'' Best recalls. `` But we did n't win; we lost. Now we've got to start all over again.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with key <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members Saturday to consider whether to enter a joint agreement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to produce a new generation of fighter plane, and a decision is expected early in the week, his press secretary said. Among those summoned to the White House for an unusual Saturday working session were Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and newly confirmed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considering a proposed joint venture with the Japanese for production in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of a new version of the F-16 jet fighter, called the FSX. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday laughed and waved off a question on whether he had made a decision about the project when he happened upon a small group of reporters who were chatting with first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. In remarks to reporters on Friday he sought to play down earlier suggestions that a basic commitment had been made to the project, with only details remaining to be worked out. Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called his team to the White House Saturday because `` he wanted to review some of the technical issues.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision probably would come `` early next week.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been studying data on the controversial proposal, which critics say would give the Japanese advanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technical data, a move that would undercut the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial and trade base. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers are known to be divided on the merits of the deal. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has taken the lead in raising concerns over commercial and technological implications of the agreement, which was negotiated by the Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Under the U.S.-Japan deal initialed late last year, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce the next-generation fighter Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying F-16s directly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They say the deal would serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions while generating income and jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. But critics contend the tentative arrangement amounts to a giveaway of advanced technology that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may use to help propel its civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the world market. They say <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should purchase American-made planes to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. While the president worked and played tennis and horseshoes on a balmy afternoon, first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was preoccupied with her dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>'s new litter, born Friday night and early Saturday. By the time Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ready to play tennis with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> at mid-afternoon, the sky had clouded and a blustery rain was falling. But Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the family had lunch at poolside earlier. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said Friday that he was eager to `` unleash all the athletic events'' for the weekend at the White House. His new horseshoe pit was to be formally opened in a couple of weeks with what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called a `` very big gala opening'' featuring horseshoe pitchers from across the country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was also expecting to pick up his outdoor running again. He has been using an indoor treadmill. He said he had a `` hiatus'' from his usual two-mile jog in recent weeks because he had the flu.

<TEXT>
 The head of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Saturday that the pact that ended the Soviet military involvement in the nation has been breached, but he would not say who committed them or what they were. The comments came on the same day as at least four Soviet IL-76 military transports arrived in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Soviets, which completed its troop withdrawal last month, resumed military aid to the government last week. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Rauli </PERSON> <PERSON> Helminen </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have repeatedly charged each other with violating the accord, but their complaints have often proved inaccurate. Others are difficult to check, he told a news conference. <PERSON> Helminen </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It was set up to investigate alleged violations of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Accord that cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s departure after nine years in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The mission is made up of about 40 officers from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` There are problems. After 11 months, more than half of our mandate remains unfulfilled,'' said <PERSON> Helminen </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreed under the accord to stay out of each other's internal affairs. But since then, he said, the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government has filed 3,000 complaints accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the accord by continuing to arm the Moslem insurgents and sending hundreds of its soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supports the Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government, has lodged at least 800 complaints against <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> says Afghan planes have bombed its territory in attacks on Moslem guerrilla camps. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government has called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to set up checkpoints along the border. But <PERSON> Helminen </PERSON> said that will not happen until warring Afghans call a cease-fire. The Soviets have said they will continue to supply equipment to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops as long as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supply the guerrillas. The military supplies <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is supplying to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> include medium-range Scud B missiles and other defensive arms. The Soviets resumed the military supplies after guerrillas launched an offensive against <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. After nearly two weeks, heavy fighting around the strategic city appears to have reached a stalemate.

 Thousands of Moslems paraded through <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s hometown Saturday demanding a judicial inquiry into the police killings of 13 people during a protest against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, authorities in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> banned a demonstration planned Saturday afternoon to protest the novel, saying the march threatened public order. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run media on Saturday said Moslem leaders' condemnation of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> last week was a victory for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, even though the leaders stopped short of supporting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s call for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death as punishment for the book, which many Moslems find blasphemous Also Saturday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said the controversy over `` The Satanic Verses'' may not have hurt prospects for the release of 15 foreign hostages there. In the 10-mile-long <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> march, young Moslems waving black banners and shouting `` down with <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> police'' tried to surge ahead, but older men held them back while steel-helmeted policemen stood along the road, watching silently. All shops had closed along the procession's route and traffic had thinned. Thousands of armed policemen in riot gear followed the procession. During a demonstration Feb. 24, police opened fire to stop defiant Moslems from marching to the British consulate, killing 13 people. The crowd was demanding a ban in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book. Nineteen people in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have died in violence related to the novel. Bombay-born <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is a British citizen who maintains that his book is neither against Islam nor its holy book, the Koran. Iranian clerics last month offered a $ 5.2 million reward for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s murder and he has been in hiding since `` The Satanic Verses,'' banned in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and several other nations, includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives and the suggestion that the prophet wrote the Koran rather than receiving it fromn Allah. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Saturday hailed the `` decisive stance'' taken by leaders at the meeting of the 45-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. At the meeting, which ended Thursday in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the members voted to declare <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> an apostate. The conference did not confirm <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hoped, but Iranian news commentaries played down that fact and said declaring <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> an apostate was tantamount to confirming <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said that the conference decision made headlines in all the Iranian papers, each callin the organization's declaration a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> earlier this month over what it saw as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s role for protecting <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and leading the European reaction against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s execution order against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON>, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that although many felt the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair set back prospects for release of the foreign hostages, `` I am not sure that is correct. `` I was encouraged, I must say, by the statements made by some leading Moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms that there is no reason to continue holding hostages. This is very much a crime against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> said. But he warned: `` I do not want to raise release hopes and I do not want to sound over-optimistic.'' Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentialists.

 Farmers were urged to save their faltering nation Saturday as they gathered for the first congress in eight years of their banned union, Rural Solidarity. `` The national economy is destroyed. People in towns and villages live on the edge of poverty. But this is our country. We have to save it for ourselves and our children,'' union chairman <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> told 450 farmers from every region of the country. <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> said the congress must ensure authorities keep a promise to legalize Rural Solidarity and that the union must prepare for national elections of the union in December. The meeting took place before the end of talks between authorities and the opposition which have yielded agreement in principle to legalize Solidarity, Rural Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. All three were banned after martial law was introduced December 1981. Parliament will consider draft legislation Tuesday to legalize them again. `` During those eight years, which we spent in prison or in hiding, we did not forget the ideals of Solidarity. Some of our colleagues paid with their lives,'' <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> reminded members and some 50 invited foreigners and advisers. `` We can meet again after eight years thanks to Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, thanks to his persistence and determination. He is the symbol of Solidarity for cities and villages,'' he said of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of the allied workers' union, Solidarity. The hall erupted into chants of `` Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!'' when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared. `` My role has been to lead you to this point, so that you can meet and decide about your own activities,'' he told cheering farmers. Later Saturday, Solidarity's national executive commission met to assess the state of talks with authorities. `` I am satisfied. The meeting was full of arguments, but it helped clarify things,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters afterward. The meeting came as the talks near their final phase, and a day after the union declared a crisis over the authorities' decision to submit an electoral reform bill to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> without consulting the opposition. Solidarity has said the bill did not reflect agreements reached for what would be the communist bloc's first democratic elections. The government late Friday said it only wanted <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the bill, not prejudge any agreement. <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, the powerful Solidarity leader from <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, said Saturday he did not think the conflict would derail final agreement on political and economic reforms. `` I can not see such a possibility in which this accord would not take place,'' he said.

 Disclosures of detailed warnings in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> have prompted calls for new investigations and appeals for more government openness about terrorist threats. A congressional subcommittee analysis of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> security warnings, due for release Sunday, will show that many <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> warnings are `` woefully inadequate,'' according to a committee staff member. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> dispatched top aides to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this weekend to examine the growing controversy over the warnings and to determine the safety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines from terrorist attack.

The latest actions follow revelations and discussions in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about very specific warnings that airlines and government officials were sharing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the weeks before the bombing over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. None of the information got to passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, after it did warn passengers of a bomb threat against a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Paris </LOCATION> flight last week, said it has a long-standing policy of advising travelers and giving them the option of taking other flights when there is a specific threat against an individual flight. The <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster was not preceded by any reported threat that named a specific plane. But disclosures over the past several weeks indicate that authorities had several other warnings, including what airline and flights might be endangered, in what month the bombing could occur, what type of explosive and triggering device might be used and even how the bomb might be concealed in a radio-cassette. Investigators concluded that a radio-cassette containing plastic explosives set to go off at a certain altitude blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. Both British aviation authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had described a radio-cassette bomb in security warnings a month earlier, after one was confiscated in a raid in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that it received a warning about such a device from the West German government on Nov. 10. Various other warnings that have elements similar to what occurred in the Pan Am bombing also were issued Dec. 5 to all airlines, Dec. 13 to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies, Nov. 17 to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, Nov. 22 to British airlines and Dec. 19 to British airports and several airlines. Some of the warnings, including the final one two days before the bombing, were not received for several days. Although investigators apparently have focused much of their attention on the Palestinian guerrilla group which was the subject of some of the warnings, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials said Friday that contrary to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> press reports, they had not captured or identified any suspected bomber. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where several committees have been examining issues raised by the destruction of Flight 103, House Government Operations subcommittee staff members were compiling 27 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security warnings issued in 1988 and another four this year, most of them not made public. The subcommittee planned to look into how each one was handled, who was warned, when they were warned, and how the government and airlines dealt with the threats, a subcommitee source said, discussing the report on condition of anonymity. `` We are looking at their accuracy, timeliness and usefulness,'' the source said. The report is to focus particularly on the Nov. 17 warning dealing with a radio-cassette bomb. The source said subcommittee chairwoman Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., decided to conduct the analysis because there of confusion about the warnings and a host of complaints from victims' relatives and others <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> high school administrator who was one of about 20 victims' relatives who met with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, said the families are calling for a ban on all batteries on airliners, because plastic explosives can not be set off without a battery. The group also wants a system set up so passengers can call a number and find out about any threats, more efforts to match luggage with passengers and routine questioning of passengers as they board flights. `` At best, this has been handled in a chaotic way,'' said <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> was killed in the bombing. `` At worst, there's been a coverup.''

 A 36-step pencil sharpener devised by the home team won the <ORGANIZATION> Rube </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contest </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday by making a simple task hard. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who died in 1970, was a cartoonist famous for his humorously complicated machines to perform simple tasks. In keeping with his spirit, student teams from three universities invented machines designed to sharpen a wooden pencil in less than five minutes, with at least 25 steps. <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> engineering students won with a contraption called `` Watch-N-Ponder,'' in part because, unlike the entries from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, no one had to nudge and prod their machine to the finish line. The Watch-N-Ponder was set in motion by placing a test paper in the hand of a doll dressed like a student, which activated a panic sign. Thirty-some-odd steps later, a newly sharpened pencil fell through a series of guides into the arms of the doll, who then exclaimed with a cartoon-style caption, `` Whew, Thanks!'' A $ 100 second-place prize went to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> team for `` <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> <PERSON> Badger </PERSON>'s Hydro-Electro-Mechanical All-Purpose Pencil Sharpener.'' The badger is the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> school symbol. The <ORGANIZATION> Rube </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contest </ORGANIZATION> originated at <LOCATION> Purdue </LOCATION> in 1949 as a competition between two engineering fraternities. It died out in the mid -'50s but was revived six years ago and opened to all <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> This year was the first `` national'' competition, which drew the entries from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

 A Teamsters official threatened on Saturday to expand the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike to rival Pan American, while union leaders discussed ways for employees to buy both carriers in `` the opportunity of a lifetime.'' Eastern employees rallied in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> threw his support behind the workers and challenged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the labor war with Eastern boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. Eastern's 8,500 Machinists entered their third week on strike, which has crippled the nation's seventh-largest airline and forced it to seek bankruptcy protection. The workers have refused to give wage concessions. And a top Teamsters official warned that the strike could be expanded to struggling <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which competes with Eastern on the <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle route. `` One of the -LRB- strike -RRB- targets would be the shuttle of Pan American ... where <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is now being picketed,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>. `` Therefore we could tie up the Northeast corridor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is a fight for every working person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Federal judges have restrained other unions from sympathy strikes that could have extended to the nation's railways and other airlines. But Genoese said a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> strike would be legal because its 4,200 <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> employees have an open contract and other unions could honor their picket lines as pilots and flight attendants have done at Eastern. Pan American has beefed up its shuttle service since <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s strike began March 4 while <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> dropped fares to attract passengers to its shuttle flights Genoese said he did n't want to discuss strike timing or strategy further. Meanwhile, rallies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> launched the third week of the walkout. A crowd estimated by police at more than 1,000 turned out for a rousing, flag-waving rally at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, wearing a black satin pilot's jacket and a pilot's cap, challenged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the labor war with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` Focus your thousand points of light on this situation. It's time to lead, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>,'' he said In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, about 300 people gathered across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to hear similar remarks aimed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was reported to be relaxing on the White House grounds playing horseshoes and tennis. `` C'mon <PERSON> George </PERSON>, get with it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Interntional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, pointing at the White House. He called for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene by naming an emergency board to mediate the dispute. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to impose a cooling-off period that would have delayed the strike by 60 days, and has remained opposed to government intervention in the walkout that began March 3. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been walking picket lines with the strikers in the past two weeks, said he was making `` an appeal to presidential leadership, an appeal for mercy and justice.'' In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, a crowd estimated at about 700 people attended a rally in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> terminal that was cut short by torrential rains. Genoese made his comments after having breakfast Saturday with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, and local Teamsters and <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss strategy, including a proposed joint employee buyout that would combine the two struggling airlines. `` This is the opportunity of a lifetime,'' Genoese said. `` They can save two airlines.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has been pushing several years for employee control of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a solution to its problems, and Genoese said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s situation provides an opening to combine that goal with a similar effort he has pushed for years at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the employees had ample financial backing, but declined to give details. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the company would n't comment on the Bryan-Genoese remarks. There was no answer Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> corporate headquarters. Although Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> are two of the weakest major carriers, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and Genoese said their route structures and personnel combined could create a strong, stable airline. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> added that other possibilities are still being explored, such as a buyout of Lorenzo by financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has expressed renewed interest in selling Eastern <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, has been racked by financial losses and labor tensions. Pan Am Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> recently said the carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure its survival. In a memo circulated Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it could no longer wait for its pilots to return to work. `` New pilots are our only viable option,'' the message said. `` In summary, total pilot capacity will determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> lives or dies.'' However, the pilots union says few experienced pilots are available for Eastern to hire. Eastern, with only 200 pilots crossing picket lines, has been able to operate about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the Eastern unions will fight in bankruptcy court against all sales and transfers of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets, including the airline's notice late last week that it was putting narrow-body planes in its 250-aircraft fleet up for sale. He said transfers of assets such as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> landing slots in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s predominantly non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are part of `` an enormous psychological war'' against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees.

 Israeli troops opened fire on hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Saturday, killing three Arabs. At least 20 people were reported wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Saturday, a breakaway faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said two of its fighters sneaked into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and started a gunfight Friday that left one Israeli soldier dead and another wounded. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said it arrested the infiltrators. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> protests began after Israeli riot police plastered posters on walls in a neighborhood calling on residents to keep the peace. `` What's the benefit of a demolished house, a killed son?'' an Arab reporter quoted the placards as saying. The army said it knew nothing about the posters. Enraged Arabs gathered at a nearby mosque, calling for a `` fight against the army,'' the reporter said on condition of anonymity. Protesters took to the streets, pelting soldiers with rocks, blocking roads and burning tires, he said. Demonstrations quickly spread to other <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> areas and refugee camps, said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> accounts. Merchants shut down stores and transportation came to a halt, and one witness said `` there are burning tires and barricades everywhere.'' An army spokeswoman said hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rioters in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> neighborhood attacked a patrol with stones, concrete blocks and metal bars. `` The soldiers felt that their lives were in danger and fired tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets,'' she said on condition of anonymity. The attack continued until reinforcements arrived, helping the soldiers escape, she said. `` As a result, three people were killed and 10 others wounded,'' the spokeswoman said. The army later clamped a curfew on the neighborhood, but residents defied it to hold a funeral procession, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The procession was dispersed with tear gas, the reports said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors identified the victims as <PERSON> Fawsi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahid </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON>, 19, who were both shot in the chest, and <PERSON> Majdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourani </PERSON>, 19, who was shot in the neck. An Arab witness said <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON> hurled stones at soldiers 150 feet away, refusing to stop when friends begged him. He said a soldier threatened <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON> by pointing his gun, `` but he continued to throw stones.'' `` Then one soldier fired,'' the witness said. At least another 10 Arabs were wounded elsewhere on the seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said doctors at two <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospitals. Protests continued into the night. Saturday's deaths bring to 399 the number of Arabs killed since in the 15-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> _ areas <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in 1967 from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Seventeen Israelis also have died. The official <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Petra </ORGANIZATION> said authorities arrested the two infiltrators Saturday inside <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> claimed the two men were members of its breakaway Palestinian group. The group, which earlier said the two men returned safely, later confirmed its fighters were caught and warned <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> not to harm them. The two guerrillas ambushed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrol in southern <LOCATION> Hatzeva </LOCATION> area, 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said just before the 10 p.m. clash, soldiers heard a man shout `` Stop!'' from behind a bush in English. The guerrillas fired assault rifles, then fled. It was the fourth Palestinian guerrilla raid against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a week. Two other raids were in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the third across the border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Five guerrillas were killed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and two who infiltrated from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> were captured. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> Friday, denied that Palestinian attacks against the Israeli army in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were acts of terrorism. `` Those who are defending themselves can not be named terrorists,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, referring to Israeli attacks against Palestinian strongholds in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In December <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. His remarks led <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. In northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Saturday, about 100 Israeli high school students threw stones and firebombs at police as they participated in a mock battle to prepare riot police for Arab demonstrations later this month. Israeli officials are worried that a planned strike by Israeli Arabs on so-called Land Day March 30 will turn into a violent show of support for the Palestinian rebellion in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Each year, Israeli Arabs mark Land Day to commemorate the bloody day of March 30, 1976, when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and police killed six <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> during a strike protesting government confiscation of Arab land in the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>.

 Flags waved, tears of pride flowed and a spontaneous rendition of the national anthem broke out in the desert dawn Saturday among the 450,000 people who watched the return of the space shuttle Discovery. `` I'm just fascinated by it,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dube </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a veteran of the temporary encampments that spring up on <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> here for landings of the winged spacecraft. The crowd, many of whom arrived earlier in the week, burst out in whistles and cheers at the thump of two sonic booms that preceded Discovery's arrival over this <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> base 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. About two minutes later the ship appeared, seemingly straight overhead, as a speck glinting in the dawn sunlight. Most lapsed into surprised silence at the shuttle's steep descent, but the celebration resumed as Discovery landed on a strip about five miles distant at 6:35 a.m. PST. Spectators clapped, whooped, snapped pictures and waved <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. Many spontaneously began singing the national anthem. Some cried; others hugged their children. `` The patriotic spirit here is really something,'' said <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, who flew a flag atop a telescoping 60-foot pole. `` I even bought a new flag for this.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated the crowd at the public viewing area at 450,000, and said an additional 10,000 watched at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> facility. That was second only to the 500,000 who joined President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to watch shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s July 4, 1982, landing. Shortly after landing, the estimated 138,000 motorhomes, cars and trucks jammed the two narrow, one-lane blacktop roads that led to the nearest highway, 30 miles from the vewing site. Remembering the five-hour traffic jam that followed the last landing, <PERSON> Dube </PERSON> was one of hundreds poised for a quick getaway, and was on the road right after the shuttle touched down. `` It's Saturday. If it was a work day I'd hang around a little longer,'' he said. Spectators began gathering earlier in the week to stake out prime viewing spots. The came in flag-bedecked motorhomes, aboard motorcycles, and in cars pulling travel trailers. As many as 300 people who arrived after roads to the base were closed simply pulled off the highway and drove onto the desert to watch the landing. Several got stuck or damaged their axles when they accidentally drove into holes in the desert hardpan. On Friday, the strains of country music blared over loudspeakers at the makeshift campground as military helicopters buzzed overhead and skateboarders rattled across the hardened lake bed. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolner </PERSON>, 35, a nurse from <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, witnessed the shuttle lift off Monday in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` My husband wanted to know what I wanted for Christmas and I told him I wanted to see the shuttle take off,'' she said. `` I spent the night in the car and watched it take off, and when I got home I told him I wanted to see it land. I flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Wednesday. I rented a car and here I am.'' Many of the early arrivals were so-called `` snowbirds,'' retired couples who spend their winters in warm climates. `` We winter in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> every year and we just had to see the shuttle land,'' said 74-year-old <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sunnyside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who arrived with his wife, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>. `` I'm sure we'd see it better on TV, but we just had to be here,'' he said.

 A civilian cargo plane carrying military explosives crashed in a field after takeoff from <ORGANIZATION> Carswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday, killing the two crewmen aboard and igniting numerous fires, authorities said. The crew notified <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> of an in-flight emergency moments before the plane went down, authorities said. The 21-year-old DC-9 owned by Oregon-based <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> crashed 20 minutes after takeoff. The crew was attempting to turn back to <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> when it crashed, said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage and were searching for the cockpit voice recorder. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> Carswell </LOCATION>, on the west side of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, to Tinker Air Force Base near <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, on a routine cargo flight, a company spokeswoman said. The crash site was about seven miles north of <LOCATION> Carswell </LOCATION>. The plane was carrying 12,000 pounds of general cargo, including military maintenance parts and 32 fuses used to detonate conventional bombs, said Capt. <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziebis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. Senior Airman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> of <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> said the fuses totaled the equivalent of 11.52 pounds of explosives, `` which in relative terms is a very, very small amount.'' Lt. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON>, deputy chief of public affairs at <LOCATION> Carswell </LOCATION>, said some classified materials also were aboard. An ordnance team was sent from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of any fuses that survived the fire, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> would control the investigation and the military would cooperate. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, a rancher who lives next to the 4,000-acre ranch where the DC-9 crashed, said debris was scattered over five acres. `` If it had been in a populated area, there would have been more lives lost than two,'' said <PERSON> Youngblood </PERSON>, who drove his truck through burning pastures searching for survivors. `` It would have destroyed a lot of people and homes.'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION>, said the plane made regular four-hour contract runs for the military among <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> and Tinker. The company acquired the DC-9 in 1987 and had recorded no major maintenance problems, she said. Evergreen runs 125 bases worldwide and has operated military contracts for 12 to 13 years, Ms. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` Only 10 percent of our work is military,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` We operate contracts for many major airlines, industries and the American government worldwide.'' `` Until today, we had the best safety record in the business,'' she said. The victims were identified as Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> was married and had four children Ms. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> was engaged to be married. It was the third military-related crash in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in five months. A B-1B bomber crashed Nov. 8 near <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> and a KC-135 tanker crashed, killing 19, near <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> in February.

 Soldiers began distributing ballots Saturday on the eve of national elections, but guerrillas disrupted electrical power and transportation in an attempt to discredit the balloting. The leftist guerrillas, however, assured the nation's nearly 1.8 million voters they will not be attacked if they go to the polls. The incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hope to keep control of the presidency, but they face a serious challenge by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. A leftist political alliance on Saturday accused the military of taking part in a smear campaign against it, but the military denied the charge. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION>, said about 100 posters condemning convergence members as `` communist executioners'' were plastered Friday night along one of the capital's main avenues. Col. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said `` no armed forces unit put them up'' and that the military was `` keeping strictly to the sidelines in the political process.'' A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said guerrilla military actions might be intense Sunday but that voters will not be attacked. Broadcasts resumed of paid announcements by leftist organizations the government considers guerrilla front groups, but the media heeded an order from Attorney General <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> not to air any call to boycott the election. There were no new reports of rebel attacks overnight, but the guerrillas maintained a ban on public transportation and sabotaged electrical power, affecting the water supply in some places. Voters who defy a rebel boycott will have a chance to replace an incumbent government with a different philosophy for the first time in their history. They will be looking for someone who can bring an end to nine years of civil war that left 70,000 dead and who can right a crippled economy that has an unemployment and underemployment rate of 60 percent. The three leading candidates offer options from right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION>'s free market economics and tough stance against the guerrillas to the left-wing alliance, which is linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Another political choice is to observe the guerrilla boycott. The rebels say they wants to discredit the election to show no solution to the nation's political crisis is possible without their participation. Troops began delivering ballots to polling places, but authorities did not plan to distribute ballots to 24 of nation's 260 municipalities because they are under rebel control. Twenty-one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election observers arrived Saturday. The group, named by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, includes congressmen, state politicians and private citizens. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> are trying to retain power with attorney <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, 49. He has had to fight off accusations of corruption and incompetence against his party, which has been unable to end the war or improve the economy. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is dying of liver cancer. Under the constitution, a president can not seek re-election. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>'s major challenger is businessman <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of Arena. The party was created in 1981 by <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a man accused of organizing death squads, links he denies. Many fear he would be the power behind <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s throne; his party already controls the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The new political factor is <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, a former university professor who spent seven years in exile as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is allied with the guerrillas. Four minor candidates are not expected to be significant factors. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has been leading the latest polls, but the large number of voters who express no preference has led many to expect a runoff in April between <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>. The new president will take office June 1 for a five-year term. The director of one of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s most respected polling organizations denied a newspaper report that it predicted victory for <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baro </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said its March 1 to 15 poll did not suggest a winner because too many people refused to respond to questions due to `` Fear _ fear to express a preference.'' Polltakers contacted 1,599 people, he said, but 41.5 percent refused to indicate who they would vote for and 13 percent did not plan to vote. He said 26.2 percent supported <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, 12.9 percent were for <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> and 4.2 percent preferred Ungo. In 1982 and 1984 elections, Salvadorans voters went to the polls in large numbers despite the threat of violence by the left. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, more than 1,200 sign-waving protesters marched Saturday into Times Square to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration -LRB- must -RRB- choose between negotiations or an escalation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement,'' said coordinator <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Stop the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> War in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The guerrilla traffic ban started at midnight Wednesday, when campaigning ended by law, and has halted highway traffic in most of the country. Guerrillas launched sporadic attacks and called on election workers to quit. More than 50 percent of the country was without electricity because the guerrillas have destroyed light poles, transformers and power lines. Phone lines also were down in many parts of the country. The guerrillas had offered to participate in the election if it were postponed until September.

<HEAD>Ex-Prisoners Destroy Swimming Pool Where They Were Tortured</HEAD>

 Former political prisoners and a Roman Catholic bishop used sledgehammers to demolish a swimming pool where the prisoners said they had been tortured by being forced underwater for long periods. In another development two opposition parties that had indicated they might boycott national elections set for May 1 opened conventions Saturday to select candidates. The public swimming pool, located in a city formerly named after deposed President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, was destroyed Friday on orders of the provisional president, Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. The city, 235 miles east of the capital of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, has been renamed the City of the East. `` A black era in which human rights and respect for human and Christian dignity were gravely wounded is ending,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaken </PERSON>, the bishop of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> who struck the second blow to shatter the pool. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Casco </PERSON>, president of the city's appeals court, said `` they are giving the final blows to something that symbolized the weeping and pain of many people _ the torture pool.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> came to power in a Feb. 3 coup, ousting Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> who ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for nearly 35 years. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has promised to respect human rights. His interior minister, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, pledged to abolish police torture facilities and to prosecute officials accused of participating in human rights abuses. Reporters were invited to the city to watch the demolition of the pool. A local government official, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, lifted a hammer to deliver the first strike. `` The practice of torture has ended forever,'' he said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ruled this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> nation of about 4 million people by relying on the military, militants in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and police to crush dissent. Many political opponents were harassed, jailed, tortured and exiled. Last week two police officers charged with torturing prisoners were suspended and three municipal magistrates were arrested. In an anti-corruption campaign, five former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and seven people who served as aides to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> have been charged with crimes including fraud, bribery and embezzlement. The Revolutionary Febrerista and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties opened two-day nominating conventions Saturday. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, a possible presidential nominee for the Febreristas, said his party `` could hardly expect to win'' but felt it should challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in power since 1947. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, 69, directed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, office of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> until his retirement in 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> are expected to nominate <PERSON> Secundino </PERSON> <PERSON> Numez </PERSON> as their presidential candidate. <PERSON> Numez </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest and a professor of theology and anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Febreristas, <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> had formed the National Accord coalition that opposed <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government. Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential candidate and is expected to win the election with the party retaining control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the largest single opposition group and is to decide at a March 25-26 convention if it will participate in the elections. Party President <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> has indicated it probably will not. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> has asked that the election be delayed for at least two months, that voter registration be expanded and that coalitions such as the National Accord be allowed to endorse candidates. The government rejected or ignored those demands.

 The space shuttle Discovery plunged out of space to a desert landing at dawn Saturday, ending an almost flawless mission that included completion of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s satellite communication system. `` Well done, Discovery. That's one to be proud of,'' capsule communicator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON> said. The shuttle, bearing a five-man crew, four crippled rats, 32 fertilized chicken eggs and other experiments, landed on schedule at 6:36 a.m. on a paved runway on <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, watched by a near-record 460,000 spectators. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the country's happy this morning. It's a beautiful day in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, the space agency's associate administrator, said after Discovery touched down `` It's marvelous people can come out on such a pretty morning and watch it,'' Truly added. `` I think the country realizes we're back.'' The landing looked perfect, as promised from orbit when shuttle commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, a veteran <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft carrier pilot, radioed `` 3 wire'' to mission control. He referred to the best arresting cable for a plane to snag when landing on the deck of a carrier. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> television close-ups of the shuttle after its 1.9-million-mile trip showed numerous white marks on the black thermal tiles that protect the shuttle's underside from the heat of re-entry. But Truly described the damage as `` a few minor chips.'' `` The vehicle is just as clean as it can be,'' Truly said at a post-landing news conference. In December, the shuttle Atlantis suffered severe tile damage when it was hit by insulation falling off a booster rocket and fuel tank during the launch. About seven hours after Discovery landed, the astronauts and their wives arrived in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where they were greeted by their children and a cheering crowd of about 500 people. Coats told the crowd of friends, fellow <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers and space program fans that he `` had an awful lot to be thankful for and an awful lot to be proud of.'' All the crew members praised <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees for getting the shuttle program back on track and for Discovery's performance. `` It was an awful lot of fun being out in space,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, who added that all the crew members had waited a long time to fly. The five-day mission's main objective, deployment of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s third Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, was accomplished Monday, the day Discovery was launched from Kennedy Space Center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Results of a variety of experiments carried out by the crew awaited scientific analysis. The four rats with intentionally injured leg bones were killed about four hours after landing, as were four others in a control group kept on the ground, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindelar </PERSON> said. The dead rodents were sent to <ORGANIZATION> Orthopaedic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for analysis, she said. The eggs were destined for an analysis of weightlessness on embryo development. The student experiment was sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>. `` The eggs are in wonderful shape. None are cracked. None are broken,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Detwiler </PERSON>. He said half the eggs were opened for study immediately while the remainder were being flown to company headquarters in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. One of the 16 allowed to hatch will go to the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Zoo, while <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scientists will study the others The crew of Coats, pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> also shot miles of film with a 70mm IMAX camera to document environmental damage on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Their last day began with a wake-up call from ground controllers that included recordings of their children saying such things as `` Get up, dad, get out of bed, get to work.'' The astronauts responded with a recording of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>'s `` Homeward Bound.'' Other experiments included growing plants in microgravity, plus growing protein crystals in a project aimed at developing new drugs. Discovery's flight was the 28th shuttle mission and the third since the shuttle Challenger exploded after launch on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its seven astronauts. The crowd that watched the landing was second in size only to the 500,000 who joined then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in watching <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> touch down on July 4, 1982. Good weather, a weekend landing and the start of spring vacation combined to more than double the anticipated crowd, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON>. The $ 100-million <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION>, the third satellite placed in orbit, completed the space agency's vital shuttle communications system, which allows near-constant communication between shuttles and ground controllers. The relay system also shortens what used to be a 15-minute blackout during the heat of re-entry to about three minutes. The system also will allow <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to shut down six ground stations at an annual savings of $ 13 million. The only major hitch of the flight occurred Tuesday when one of three hydrogen tanks feeding the fuel cells that generate electricity for the shuttle developed erratic pressure. Unnecessary lights and computers were shut off and controllers considered ending the flight a day early. But by Wednesday the problem had been corrected. The several miles of film shot with the IMAX camera will be made into a movie documenting ocean pollution, flooding in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, burned areas of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, deforestation in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and erupting volcanoes in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had several options for landing, depending on the weather. If there had been a good cross wind, Discovery would have landed on the hard clay lake bed runway to test crosswind handling. But wind died so the base's 15,000-foot-long, 300-foot-wide paved runway was used so that tests of moderate brake pressure could be conducted. The landing tests are intended to enable a resumption of landings on the concrete runway at <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, eliminating the need to ferry shuttles back from <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> atop a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747.

<HEAD>Communist Party to Form Shadow Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s large <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday it will form a shadow government to convince voters it could effectively govern the country. <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON>, party secretary, said the shadow government will be composed of both <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and intellectuals or other specialists, and it will put forth `` policy and governmental proposals.'' <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON> outlined the proposal in a speech opening the 18th congress of the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or PCI, which is the country's second-largest party but has suffered a steady slide in votes. <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON>, who took the party reins last summer, called for a change in the composition of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s government, which for four decades has been dominated by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> while the Communists have been kept out of governing coalitions. He appealed for new alliances with <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> groups and with lay parties, particularly the four parties in the current governing coalition led by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>.

At the same time, he said, `` we want to develop in a more open and rich way a policy of dialogue and collaboration ... with the party of -LRB- Soviet President -RRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and with other Communist parties committed to the democratization of the countries they govern.'' The Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> broke with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1970s and has since pursued its own course, which included an effort to rule with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-70s. <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON> suggested Saturday that that effort _ known as the `` historic compromise'' _ was mistaken. The party has declined steadily in the polls over the past decade, winning just 26.6 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections in 1987 after nearly overtaking the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in 1976.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is renegotiating its contract with the next operator of the <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to better influence how the nuclear weapons facility is run, according to a report published Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will assume operation of the plant from <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> on April 1. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> won a five-year, $ 6.7 billion contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to run <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>. DOE sources and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> wants to make the company more accountable for its operations at the complex, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. Officials said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' goal is to `` restructure the relationship'' between <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> reportedly wants to give the agency a more dominant role and prevent a recurrence of operational problems that have plagued <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which designed and built the 300-square-mile facility and has operated it since 1950. All three reactors at the plant have been shut down since last summer for safety upgrades, maintenance and establishment of new operative procedures. The reactors are the nation's sole source of weapons-grade tritium, a perishable gas vital to the production of nuclear warheads. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the contract between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> is being renegotiated. He characterized the discussions as amicable and said he saw no obstacle to completing them before April 1. DOE officials and others have been alarmed by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to bring in only 40 new managers at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> after the company had pledged to bring in `` several hundred,'' according to the newspaper report <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> has a total work force of about 17,000. `` My personal opinion is that 40 is not enough,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s independent safety panel and former chairman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s defense program, said Friday he is satisfied that <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> will fulfill its commitments.

 A Lebanese Palestinian went on trial in absentia Saturday on charges of organizing the 1982 attack on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main synagogue that killed a 2-year-old boy and wounded 37 people. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Zomar </PERSON> was to be extradited from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to stand trial, but the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government decided last December to deport him to the country of his choice, saying he had been `` acting in the struggle for the reacquisition of his country.''

<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid leaders in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> say a prolonged rent boycott is likely to continue until the vast black township is unified economically and politically with neighboring <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. A committee of activists, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, concluded in a new report that <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> will never be able to pay off a $ 300 million debt accumulated since most families stopped paying rent and service charges in 1986. The committee is urging the white-controlled government to write off the debt and create a single tax base for <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> so money spent by blacks in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> can be returned to their own community for development and services. `` No development policy for <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> will succeed until <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> are treated as one urban economy,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-member committee, at a news conference Thursday. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general-secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal represents a fundamental challenge to apartheid because a unified economy would entail a unified political entity. `` The demand is actually for a normal country with normal cities,'' he said. `` The system must be deracialized.'' An estimated 2.5 million blacks live in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the country's largest municipality The white population of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and its adjacent suburbs is about 600,000. The rent boycott, launched to press grievances against the government, has evolved into one of the most effective forms of protest available to blacks under the 33-month-old state of emergency. Authorites have used numerous tactics in futile attempts to break the boycott, including late-night eviction raids such as one in August 1986 that led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a clash with police. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>'s committee said the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> town council should write off rental arrears owed by householders, implement affordable service charges, and establish a formula for transferring ownership of rented homes to long-term occupants. A study released by the committee said Sowetans spend $ 400 million annually in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, generating tax revenue that benefits white residents without returning to <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. According to the study, businesses provide about 70 percent of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s tax revenue, enabling white homeowners to pay lower service fees than Sowetans yet get better services. Compared to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> has only a handful of licensed businesses. The most common businesses in the township are unlicensed grocery stores and pubs which pay no taxes. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>'s committee already has met with the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> town council and hopes to arrange a further meeting. The activists also want to confer with the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> mayor, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkhwanazi </PERSON> has surprised the activists by acknowledging their influence in the community. The committee includes the general-secretary of the black miners' union, <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>.

 Police detained seven executives of the Stari Trg lead mine in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province where ethnic Albanian workers have been on strike for more than three weeks, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television reported Saturday. The miners have ignored a federal order to return to work. They went on strike Feb. 21 to protest planned constitutional changes they say would limit the province's autonomy. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where 85 percent of the people are ethnic Albanians, is an administrative part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic. The television report said the seven detained executives are ethnic Albanians accused of counterrevolutionary activities and they would be held for a month while an investigation continues. Two other directors of the Stari Trg mine were detained earlier his month in what was seen as an effort to get the strikers to return to work. Reports from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> said that on Friday only ten maintenance employees were on duty at the Stari Trg mine that has a normal work force of 1,300. Hundreds of workers at the nearby <LOCATION> Goles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kisnica </LOCATION> mines have joined the strike. A compulsory work order was issued by <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s federal government on Feb. 27. The <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> students in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> were attending classes but refusing to speak. It also said Friday three students were sentenced to prison by a court in <LOCATION> Prizren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s capital, for disseminating hostile propaganda to `` destroy unity.'' It said the students of Albanian descent were given sentences ranging from three to four years. The <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to meet on March 24 to approve changes in the provincial constitution that would give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> much greater control over the region.

<HEAD>Britain Issues New Security Orders to its Carriers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New security orders have been issued to all of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s major airports, a <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> airport spokesman said Saturday. The orders came amid controversy over warnings received before the December bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. The British news media said it was believed the new directive requires passengers to remove all electric and electronic equipment from luggage before check-in and to pack such items in hand luggage to be examined at boarding gates. Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Flight 103 on Dec. 21 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground, was concealed in a radio-cassette player. A Manchester airport spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice, said the orders were received Friday night but he could not give details because it was a security matter. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> would not say if a new directive had been sent. But it reaffirmed a Feb. 18 message that advised all airlines using British airports to begin asking travelers if their baggage contained radios, computers or such equipment and then to examine the items for possible explosives. The message did not say if examined items should be carried as hand baggage or be checked through with other luggage. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came under renewed attack Saturday for its handling of a bomb warning before Flight 103 blew up. It was disclosed Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had prepared a warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb disguised in a radio-cassette player, but it did not mail the advisory until after Christmas. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said the advice was of little importance because similar information had been disseminated a month earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and changed planes at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport before departing for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Early editions of two Sunday newspapers, The Observer and The Sunday Telegraph, said the Dec. 19 warning carried several details that would have helped security people spot a rigged radio-cassette player. The Sunday Telegraph quoted <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> as saying, `` Yes, maybe the security information contained in the December 19 letter should have been sent out by telex. The reason this was not done was because the crucial element of the message consisted of a color photograph of a possible explosive device.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday repeated its request for an independent inquiry into the Flight 103 disaster. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman, said <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> had caused `` muddle and confusion'' over the issue of warnings. `` The relatives of those who died in the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster have the right to expect a full and open account of how the government responded from the moment it received the warnings of a possible terrorist attack,'' he said. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> responded by saying <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> was using the situation `` to try and make party political points of the worst possible kind, preying on the grief of bereaved people. `` We're trying to get to the bottom of this,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said on a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> broadcast. Conservative legislator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adley </PERSON> on Friday replied to criticism from the opposition and from families of the victims. He said `` malicious Labor politicians, hysterical Americans and news-hungry media'' had united in a `` witch hunt aimed at the Conservative government in general and the secretary of state for transport in particular.''

 Searchers who followed directions given by executed killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> have found bones and the tattered remnant of a blouse near a site where <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said he buried a 17-year-old girl he killed in 1974. <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> said Saturday the bones were recovered from three separate sites just outside the boundaries of this park 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At one site, searchers found widely scattered bones and what appeared to be a piece of a tan blouse with lace, <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said. `` We have our suspicions that the bones from the two locations are not human, but there will have to be a positive identification on all three,'' <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said. `` In one location we did find some teeth, so we're sure it's an animal.'' Sheriff's Chief Deputy <PERSON> Leeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkerhoff </PERSON> said the remains would be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> for analysis. If any are found to be human, the sites will be carefully excavated to preserve evidence. However, <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said a positive identification would be possible only if a skull and teeth are found so they can be compared with <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>'s dental records. The bones were in a general area described by <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to detectives who interviewed him at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in the days before his Jan. 24 execution in the electric chair. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was convicted of only three murders in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but before his execution he confessed to more than 20 killings and is considered a suspect in more deaths and disappearances. Eight of those he confessed killing were in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, but he gave descriptions of only two of their burial sites. If the bones found are not human, <PERSON> Ekker </PERSON> said his office will make only one more effort to recover the remains of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, who disappeared from her <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood on Oct. 2, 1974. The sweep on Friday was the fourth since <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed that he killed the girl and buried her between <LOCATION> Torrey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fruita </LOCATION> just outside the national park boundaries. <PERSON> Brinkerhoff </PERSON> said 28 members of the <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sevier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> search and rescue squads combed the area, marking any mound which might be a grave. Of five mounds marked, three produced bones.

 More than 60 people were arrested Saturday when protesters gathered in several cities and at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> military base to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Police arrested 28 people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where about 250 demonstrators turned out in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> offices, and 40 people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where more than 300 demonstrators marched on <ORGANIZATION> McGuire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, more than 1,200 sign-waving protesters marched on Times Square. No arrests were reported. Smaller demonstrations were held in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuld </PERSON>, an organizer of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> demonstration, said there were 60 such rallies being held across the country, but that figure could not be independently confirmed. The actions were timed to coincide with the presidential elections in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, scheduled for Sunday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, demonstrators gathered in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where they heard a speech from <PERSON> Arnoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> of the FMLN-FDR, the Salvadoran rebel alliance. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, addressed the group when it arrived in Times Square. `` It's going quite well. The feelings here are quite strong,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Elia </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Stop the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> War in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The rally was to be followed by civil disobedience on Monday, with protesters blockading a federal building in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration -LRB- must -RRB- choose between negotiations or an escalation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement,'' said coalition coordinator <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. `` Many fear a Vietnam-like disaster if the administration chooses the latter course.'' The rally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was orderly at first, with 300 to 400 people gathering outside the front gate of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, base spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> said. However, he said some protesters began climbing over gates and fences to get into the base, and then sat down and refused to move. Some were carried away, <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> said. No injuries were reported. `` The point of the demonstration was to be arrested to show we are resisting the war with our bodies and feel so strongly against this U.S.-financed war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said coalition spokeswoman <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. Of the 28 people arrested in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, three were charged with disorderly conduct and the rest were charged with obstructing traffic on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Schuld </PERSON> said the demonstrators hoped to `` send a strong message to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support peace in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' `` We're just not going to let business go on as usual,'' she said, adding `` $ 3.6 billion has been sent to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> over the last eight years to support death squads.'' The rally was held at the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> to underline what Ms. <PERSON> Schuld </PERSON> called `` very weak'' press coverage of events in the Central American nation. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, about 150 protesters marched in the rain from the largely Hispanic Mission District to the Federal Building. No one was arrested. About 100 people gathered in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> to hear speakers at a morning meeting at The <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> before a march to the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> building.

 The first criminal trial stemming from Wall Street's insider trading scandals faced the prospect of a second mistrial when a jury on Saturday reported an 11-1 deadlock after eight days of deliberations. A federal judge asked jurors in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation case to reconsider all evidence after they reported the split following more than 65 hours of deliberations. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case is the first trial based on the confessions of insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, which led to the indictment, and is considered a test of the government's ability to try Wall Street corruption. `` Your honor. We need help. There are 11 jurors who have come to a unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror who does not agree,'' the jury reported in a note read in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The panel reported that the juror said `` under no circumstances'' could he agree with the other jurors' decision. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> are charged with allegedly trying to boost the stock price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of shares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy among the eight counts. Under an instruction known as the <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> charge, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> asked the jurors to reconsider their positions in the securities fraud case and sent them back to deliberate. `` Before I declare a mistrial and discharge you I want to point out a few things to you,'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said. `` It is desirable that if a verdict can be reached that this be done.'' But <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> told the jury that they should not reverse positions solely to reach a verdict and left resolution to the `` conscientious judgment of each juror.'' After hearing the judge's statement, the jury said it wanted to continue deliberating Sunday afternoon. The point of conflict among the jurors and whether the 11 supported acquittal or conviction were not known. A mistrial would be the second in the case. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declared a mistrial Jan. 10 after ruling that the prosecution unintentionally withheld a key piece of evidence. The second trial lasted six weeks. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemical and building materials manufacturer, faces a maximum fine of $ 12 million, or $ 500,000 on each of the eight counts. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, faces 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 2 million. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case is being closely followed by Wall Street defense attorneys as a key indication of prosecutors' ability to convince juries of Wall Street crimes, and of the reliability of information supplied by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is serving a three-year term on insider trading charges. The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s profits from the planned sale of a large block of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical concern earlier in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> denied the charges in what became the first case to reach the trial phase in a wave of Wall Street corruption investigations by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office has brought charges in more than 50 securities fraud cases since 1983. Nearly all the claims, however, have involved civil charges. Criminal frauds to date, including pending charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, have been settled through plea bargains. The government based its case on the testimony of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> broker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, an admitted felon expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as part of a plea arrangement with the government.

<HEAD>Records of Historic Forum On Eurocommunism to Be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The records of a historic 1956 forum of Hungarian intellectuals who espoused views later known as Eurocommunism will be published this year, speakers at an academic meeting said Saturday. In 1956, before the uprising against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule that same year, a circle of university students and other intellectuals organized seven gatherings to discuss a variety of political, economic and cultural themes. Texts of the lectures and debates of the <LOCATION> Petoefi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, named after the 19th century poet <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Petoefi </PERSON>, have never been published. The forum proposed reforms adopted by the Eurocommunists more than 10 years later. Eurocommunism advocated independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and democratic elections. Speakers at Saturday's meeting of about 500 people, including many <ORGANIZATION> Petoefi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> supporters, said the full minutes of the forum would be published between June and September. The meeting, called to discuss the importance of the Petoefi Circle in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s contemporary history, was announced in the Hungarian press, which has recently become increasingly open. One of the organizers was <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON>, a sociologist who was prominently involved in the 1956 forum and kept records of the debates for eventual publication. `` We wanted reforms, we certainly did not want a counterrevolution, but it should also be admitted that we did not want a revolution either,'' <PERSON> Hegedues </PERSON> told participants. The 1956 uprising has officially been described as a counterrevolution designed to break Communist rule. But Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and other reformers have called it a popular uprising, setting off a fierce debate in the party on the sensitive issue. A recent party Central Committee session issued a statement saying the 1956 revolt began as a popular uprising but later turned into a counterrevolution.

After four hours, special police units managed to overpower the man and free the judge, the reports said. The judge suffered minor cuts on her palms.

 When <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> was convicted in 1986 of stealing more than $ 200,000 worth of historical documents from the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> National Historic Site, he promised to give all the artifacts back. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, 68, admitted Friday that he had n't kept his word. The former <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor pleaded guilty to selling more artifacts from the museum, admitting that he had hidden some of his booty from federal agents investigating the heist three years ago. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, faces up to 20 years in prison after entering the plea in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal District Court. Federal officials said <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> visited the museum in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, about 30 times between 1974 and 1976 on the pretense that he was conducting historical research on <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s invention of the phonograph. In 1985, officials seized $ 200,000 worth of letters, artifiacts, sketches and equipment from <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s home after being tipped by a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> collector who had bought several documents from him. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> pleaded guilty to stealing the documents, and was sentenced to two months in prison and five years probation. He is currently in the third year of that probation, officials said. The plea agreement required <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> to turn over all of the stolen artifacts to federal officials. But officials recently were tipped by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> collector that <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> had asked to be put in touch with Japanese customers who might be interested in Edison artifacts. In a raid last October, federal agents recovered more than 180 Edison-related items from <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s house. `` The first time around, because there was such a large amount of items recovered, it was impossible to tell if there was anything left,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` We believe this is it, though.'' <PERSON> Fahy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, superintendent of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> historic site, said many of the items recovered in the two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> raids were `` one of a kind things.'' `` They all add to our understanding of <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> and how he worked,'' Ms. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. `` We're happy we've gotten these back, but we know there is more out there.

<HEAD>Polls Find Vast Majority Support Ban On Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 An overwhelming majority of Americans favor a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons, although there is no consensus on how such a ban should work, according to two polls released Saturday. A nationwide survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> found that 80 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> favored banning such weapons. A <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll showed that 72 percent favor a permanent ban on selling them, while 21 percent opposed such a ban. The Times poll found opposition to the sale and possession of the rapid-firing weapons across political, ethnic, gender, geographical and educational lines, said survey director I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. However, given several suggestions for how to remove the guns from society, respondents split three ways. Twenty-four percent said the guns should be confiscated from present owners, 30 percent supported buying the guns back and 30 percent would allow present owners to keep their guns but ban new sales. More than half of the 1,158 people polled in the Times' telephone survey said only law-abiding citizens would obey the ban, leaving the weapons mainly in the hands of criminals. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 or 4 percentage points, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll, 58 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe a ban would reduce the number of killings by unstable people, the magazine said. However, half of those polled said they did not believe such a ban would reduce drug - or crime-related killings, while 45 percent said they believe it would help Seventy-eight percent of those surveyed said they believe people should be required to provide more information to police before they are allowed to buy any kind of firearm, while 15 percent said they believe current laws are adequate. The telephone pole of 756 adults was conducted March 16-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. The issue gained national prominence in January after a suicidal gunman killed five children and wounded 30 other people in a Stockton schoolyard. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has approved a bill banning 40 types of assault weapons and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration has imposed a temporary ban on the import of foreign-made assault weapons.

<HEAD>Report: Thornburgh To Dismantle Anti-Mafia Strike Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> tentatively has decided to abolish most or all of the government's special strike forces established decades ago to fight the Mafia, according to a published report. In its Sunday editions, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is planning to dismantle the 24 regional <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> because he believes the job can best be done by local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the Times in an interview that the problem with strike forces `` is that they are an independent field office of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> that competes with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. attorneys.'' The proposal is supported by most of the nation's 94 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys but is meeting resistance from about 130 strike force attorneys, the Times said. The strike force lawyers argue that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys have limited resources for combating organized crime and that they lack personnel familiar with or experienced with dealing with such activity, the newspaper reported. The proposal, which is under study by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, already has the tentative approval of <LOCATION> Thornburgh </LOCATION>, the paper reported. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> strongly advocates abolishing the strike forces, the paper said. The local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys are pressing for a system similar to one already in use in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the strike force attorneys were merged into the local office and no longer reported directly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Supporters of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> system credit it for allowing former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to successfully prosecute several Mafia cases. In the interview, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would prefer to replace the strike forces with a `` cadre of experienced prosecutors'' who could be dispatched to work with local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys when needed. The Times said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> will decide the future of the strike forces in a few weeks. The strike forces originated in the 1960s under then-U.S. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The strike forces were to marshal the resources of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, other federal agencies, local law enforcement agencies in ridding Mafia influence in a region. The strike forces operated out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> because most organized crime activity extends beyond state borders. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s proposal is not new. Former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> unsuccessfully tried to dismantle the strike forces. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> from 1969 to 1974. As a prosecutor there, he gained attention by jailing many middle-level members of the Mafia.

 A woman who was left severely brain damaged and a quadriplegic after going to a hospital for treatment of a broken leg has been awarded $ 10 million in a medical malpractice suit.

Ms. <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON>, then 18, was riding her bicycle when she was struck by a hit-and-run driver on April 22, 1986. She was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit for treatment of her leg fracture and developed a complication known as fat embolism syndrome. The condition causes a buildup of fluid in the lungs, interfering with breathing. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, said the condition is not an uncommon reaction to a broken leg and can be corrected with oxygenation and ventilation if recognized in time. But he said the hospital's doctors failed to identify the condition until she had gone into cardiac arrest `` She was in a coma for 2 -LCB- months,'' <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said, and `` left a permanent, total 100 percent disabled spastic quadriplegic with brain damage.'' The Colombian native, who had been an honor student fluent in three languages, was hospitalized more than eight months and now can only speak a few words, <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> has $ 1.1 million in hospital bills and will need complete care the rest of her life, <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said.

 The Indian air force on Saturday displayed its firepower and tactical skills with some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most sophisticated combat aircraft. About 200 guests, including representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, were at the training field for the two-hour demonstration. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, a former pilot, watched through binoculars. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said the demonstration was to show the capabilities of the country's combat planes and to encourage young men to consider a military career. The air show was televised nationally. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has 115,000 men and more than 700 aircraft in its air force. Most of the planes were acquired from the Soviets. Foreign military experts have rated the skills of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> air force pilots as among the world's best, but they give the service low marks for aircraft maintenance, citing the lack of engineers and delays in obtaining spare parts. Flying 124 planes from 10 bases in the states of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the air force opened the show with supersonic runs by European-made <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet-made MiG-27 jet fighters and a flyover by MiGs and French-made Mirage 2000s. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, 17 miles away, windows and walls in some houses rattled from the sound waves. The pilots demonstrated an array of ground-attack weapons, including cluster bombs and 57mm rockets, but smoke forced officials to scratch at least two of the 12 events and parts of others because pilots could not see the targets.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Majority See Abortion As Immoral But Often Necessary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> think abortion is immoral, but they also firmly believe that each woman should be free to make her own decision about abortion, according to a nationwide poll. The survey published in Sunday's editions of the Los Angeles Times also showed overwhelming opposition to any Constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, with 62 percent against such a move and 28 percent for it, said poll director, I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. The poll was taken as anti-abortion groups prepare for a series of protests this week, with pro-abortion groups planning counter demonstrations. The poll noted, however, that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public opinion has been largely unswayed by the intense and often unruly debate over abortion, showing opinion is about the same as a decade ago. Sixty-one percent of 3,583 people surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said they believe abortion to be `` morally wrong,'' while 22 percent said it is `` morally right.'' Another 24 percent were unsure. Fifty-seven percent said they felt `` abortion is murder,'' while 35 percent disagreed with that judgement. But 74 percent agreed with a key statement: `` I personally feel that abortion is morally wrong, but I also feel that whether or not to have an abortion is a decision that has to be made by every woman for herself.'' The poll showed 21 percent disagreed with the statement and 5 percent were unsure. Overwhelming majorities favored abortion when a woman's life was threatened by her pregnancy -LRB- 88 percent -RRB-, when the pregnancy resulted from incest -LRB- 84 percent -RRB-, and when a serious birth defect was detected -LRB- 74 percent -RRB-. But most opposed abortion as a means of birth control -LRB- 80 percent -RRB-, and when an unmarried woman does n't want to marry the father -LRB- 51 percent -RRB-. Only 49 percent opposed abortion when the family is poor and ca n't afford more children. Compounding the conflicting findings was lukewarm support, 46 percent against 35 percent opposed, for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 16-year-old ruling making abortion legal The telephone poll surveyed 2,406 adults of both sexes in a cross-section sample and another 1,177 women, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The second sample was added because of abortion's special significance to women, but was adjusted to fit properly into a normal percentage mix of men and women, he said. The survey's margin of error was 3 percent.

 <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> says she has `` basically lost everything'' since her notorious liaison with former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, and now wears false buck teeth and sunglasses so people wo n't recognize her `` It's just been real hard,'' the model said Saturday in a speech at the 15th annual Institute on the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do live in a state of having to watch my every move. ... Imagine the kind of person you most dislike and think of people thinking of you as that kind of person.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> blamed her predicament on irresponsible reporters, although she noted that some journalists maintained professional conduct. She said she agreed to appear at the seminar only because she hoped to help others avoid similar experiences. `` I basically lost everything I had worked for all of my life,'' she said _ her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood. Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said she has tried to stay out of the public spotlight after being `` basically a fugitive for months. ... a prisoner of perception.'' She said she is recognized frequently in public, and has tried to hide her appearance by pulling her hair back. In addition, she added. `` I have a disguise. I have buck teeth that I put on. They cost me 80 bucks. You guys want to see?'' When the audience said yes, Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> donned a pair of glasses, bent over and inserted the false teeth. She stood upright, looking like quite a different person. `` I hope,'' she said, `` time will eventually take care of all of this.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s liaison with <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> destroyed <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> withdrew from the race in May 1987.

<HEAD>Chiropractor Ordered To Stop Blaming Demons For Clients' Health Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A chiropractor has agreed to stop advising patients their health problems are caused by demons, evil spirits or other supernatural creatures, a state official said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, owner of a chiropractic clinic that bears his name, also was placed on six months probation and agreed to stop advertising and performing a sinus treatment in which a balloon is inserted into the nose and inflated until it bursts, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, a deputy attorney general for consumer protection. The agreement between <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiners </ORGANIZATION> and the state Attorney General's Office was signed March 10, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said Friday. It culminated a three-year investigation in which <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> was ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination, he added. The attorney general's office first sought an emergency suspension of <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>'s license in January 1986 after a woman filed a complaint alleging that the chiropractor had blamed a patient's overeating on possession by demons, according to state records <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> also told the woman her husband and her mother were possessed, records show. The chiropractic board blocked that suspension. However, a follow-up investigation revealed <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> had used the balloon treatment and advertised it in the Yellow Pages between 1983 and 1987. He also had told patients their health problems were caused by demonic possessions, the investigation found.

<TEXT>
 Seven Anglican church officials led by South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> backed the Sandinista government's recent reform measures Saturday and called on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to help resettle the rebels. The clerics, who arrived in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Tuesday, issued a statement that was read by the Rev. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, primate of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The statement asked that funds provided by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to help Honduras-based Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, `` be used to repatriate or relocate -LRB- the rebels -RRB- in other countries.'' It said, `` We reject using this aid to maintain the Contras in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' The Central American presidents signed a peace proposal Feb. 14 that seeks ways to disband the Contras and promote democratic reforms by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has supported the rebels since 1981 and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is set to vote next month on additional humanitarian aid to the estimated 11,000 Contras in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is asking about $ 4 million a month for the rebels. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said he will carry a message back to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> based on his observations. `` I hope that I will be able to do it in a manner that he will understand,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his active opposition against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of segregation, headed the delegation that came to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the invitation of the Rev. Sturdie Downs, bishop of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The delegation's statement praised recent measures taken by the government as contributing to `` reconciliation and peace.'' Among those measure was the release last week of nearly 1,900 former national guardsmen and the decision to allow 10 clergymen to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Most of the guardsmen had been in prison since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> won a civil war and ousted the conservative government of President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said his visit to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` will cause certain conflicts among members of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but he added he would be willing to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` to help the people in the reconstruction of their faith as well as social justice.'' Members of the Anglican group met with President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, leaders of the political opposition, religious officials and newspaper editors. They also visited the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coastal city of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> to see the damage cause by Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> last October.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Plans Strike Force to Combat Drugs in Washington DC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 National drug director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is making plans for a federal-local strike force to give `` shock treatment'' to drug-infested areas of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, according to a published report. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who was sworn in Monday as the nation's first director of national drug control policy, had said he may make the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> a `` test case'' in the war against drugs. The district has had 114 murders so far this year as Saturday, and most were drug-related. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in Sunday's editions, quoted aides to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as saying that the strike force would target repeat drug offenders and try to shut down the city's 90 open-air drug markets. Also, abandoned military facilities could be converted into temporary prisons to provide more space to house the large number of drug offenders officials expect to arrest during the anticipated crackdown, the newspaper said. The paper quoted a source as saying that the strike force, which could be created as soon as next month, would perform simultaneous drug busts in specific neighborhoods. `` These are going to be targeted operations... We're not just going to commit 5,000 people to the streets of <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>,'' the source said. The Antidrug Abuse Act of 1988 authorizes <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to declare certain cities `` high intensity drug trafficking areas'' and to temporarily reassign federal personnel to those areas to work with state and local officials. Some local law enforcement officials have questioned if the district qualifies as a `` high intensity'' drug area. However, <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the plan was `` encouraging news ... We arrest them but they do n't go to jail, they do n't fear jail. If the federal government assists us by sending them to jail, it certainly will help.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had said Friday he did not plan to displace the local police department, but that the federal government would seek to aid local efforts. The strike force will include agents borrowed from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, as well as district and county police departments, the paper said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> `` Chuck'' <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON> to serve as a liaison for the agencies and a draft of the plan is expected within three weeks, with a formal announcement to come later.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury ruled Saturday that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> was sane during the torture-murder of his sister-in-law in 1986 and an attempt to murder his wife two years later. The jury's rejection of <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s insanity plea means he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison for first-degree murder rather than commitment to a mental institution. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, could also get up to 300 years in prison for other crimes related to the attacks on the two women. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, who worked as a maker of Christmas wreaths, mutilated and killed his wife's sister, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, 17, in 1986, and eventually described the slaying in a tape recording with which to intimidate his wife, police testified. The missing girl's grave was not discovered until police began investigating a beating that sent his wife to a hospital last September. His 22-year-old wife and his mother were in the courtroom during Saturday's psychiatric testimony and closing arguments. The psychiatric testimony marked the trial's second phase. In the first phase, the jury found <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> guilty of mutilating and sexually assaulting Miss <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>. Saturday it ruled him sane on the same charges after deliberating 1 -LCB- hours. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murdering Miss <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> and attempting to murder his wife on Sept. 3, 1988, near her sister's grave. He later pleaded innocent by reason or mental disease or defect to all charges. Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> set no date for sentencing. Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said he intended to appeal the verdicts in both trial phases.

He said that the dog adamantly refuses to use `` a beautiful pen made for her to have this blessed event in,'' and insists on remaining in the White House master bedroom. `` I never thought we'd go through something like this again _ after six kids and 11 grandchildren. But it's a whole new thing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the upcoming event is complicated by the attachment that exists between the first lady and the first dog. `` She ca n't move without the dog being 10 feet way from her,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grumbled.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is satisfied with assurances that an Israeli air force officer indicted in the espionage case of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> is not employed by an Israeli firm which supplies the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had sought clarifications from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after a news report that the officer, Col. <PERSON> Aviem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sella </PERSON>, joined <ORGANIZATION> Electro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures sophisticated optical devices, including night vision equipment for pilots. The inquiry was undertaken because under <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> policy, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government might have had to cancel its contracts with the Israeli firm because of a ban on dealings with an indicted individual, like <PERSON> Sella </PERSON>. The Pentagon has seen a letter from the chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Electro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optics </ORGANIZATION> saying <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> was not employed by the company, said the official, who spoke on condition he not be named. `` We have no information to contradict that letter,'' he said. `` As far as we're concerned, that closes the issue.'' <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> was indicted on charges he acted as the handler for <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence analyst convicted in 1987 of selling thousands of secrets to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> is serving a life sentence. <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> is one of several Israelis involved in the affair whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking to prosecute. Israeli officials have held periodic talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on clearing up the lingering controversy but have failed to reach agreement. <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before his indictment and was appointed commander of a large air force base, despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections. In keeping with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> policy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and contractors acting on government business were banned from any dealings with <PERSON> Sella </PERSON>. That fact, combined with his inability to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on business, reportedly hindered <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> in his job. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> left the military earlier this year and joined Electro Optics on March 1. The company, one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leading exporters, has a $ 10 million contract with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> to supply night vision equipment for the Apache attack helicopters. <PERSON> ElOp </PERSON> also supplies sight displays for jet pilots' visors which allows them to fly at night. In response to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> ElOp </PERSON> director <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharoni </PERSON> wrote a letter to the weekly denying that <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> was employed by the company `` in any capacity.'' That same letter was brought to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said the defense official. `` It is true we did intend to employ him as a consultant,'' <PERSON> Sharoni </PERSON> wrote, `` but this intention did not materialize.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision not to employ <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> appeared to stem from strong indications that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would object.

 National drug-control director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who says he may make the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> a `` test case'' in the war against drugs, said Friday his plans do n't include federal control of the local police. The city's soaring number of murders _ 114 as of Friday, with many of them drug-related _ has prompted talk on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> by two senators that perhaps the local police department should be replaced with a federally controlled police force. District officials have expressed fear that they may lose control over their city. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview, `` We have no plan to displace the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which I actually think has done pretty well. I think Chief -LRB- <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> -RRB- Turner's made valiant efforts here.'' On Monday, the day <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was sworn in as the nation's first director of national drug control policy, he told a news conference that in the next few weeks he may declare <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, recently becoming known as the nation's murder capital, a `` high intensity drug trafficking area.'' Such a designation would allow him to allocate federal personnel and cash to combat the problem. Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, on Thursday blamed the city's crime wave on `` inept local government that does n't understand what it's doing'' and said that if the killing continues he will consider taking `` a look at home rule, at least the law enforcement aspect. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, supported <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>'s remarks. City officials worried aloud that home rule, the right to self-governance that city residents obtained in 1973, may be more vulnerable now than ever before. `` If the federal government thinks it can do a better job of stopping drugs from coming into the city, why ca n't they do a better job of stopping drugs from entering the country?'' asked Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Friday, `` I certainly do n't think we're going to solve this problem by taking over from the city. `` Our effort ... will not be to say <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> is no more and we're taking it over,'' he said `` It will be to say, ` We're going to help. We'd like to get in and help and get out.''' In the long run, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` what's going to sustain <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is not going to be federal agencies or drug czars. It's going to be its own people, their neighborhoods, their communities, their governments They've got to stand on their own feet, run their own community. They have to take back the streets. ... We might be able to help in the interim.''

 <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who as a young musician helped introduce rock' n' roll into American pop culture, died early Friday of kidney failure.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Takeshita's Popularity Dives To 15 Per Cent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A poll released Saturday indicated support of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has plunged to 15 percent with his government embroiled in a stock trading scandal and planned sales tax. The poll was published by a leading newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, which said in an editorial: `` Taking account of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s support rate, no one would be surprised if his Cabinet should resign at any time.'' It said 3,000 adults throughout the nation were polled March 15 and 16 and support of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government dropped to 15 percent from 28 percent in January. The newspaper did not list a margin of error in the poll. The editorial said it is `` indispensable to reconstruct politics from the beginning'' by dissolving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and holding general elections. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government passed an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax that will go into effect April 1 and proscutors have arrested 12 people in the stock profiteering scandal. The scandal centers around an information conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which offered hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in its real estate subsidiary to more than 150 people, including political and business leaders. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s former finance minister was among three government officials who resigned in the scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> the third lowest rating in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s post-World War II history. Public support was polled at only 12 percent for prime ministers <PERSON> Nobusuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishi </PERSON> in 1960 and <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> in 1974. <PERSON> Kishi </PERSON> had pushed through Parliament a revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> was connected to a bribery case involving the U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition on Friday demanded again that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and his Cabinet resign and even the prime minister's advisory panel urged him to apologize to the public. <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, a member of the Wisemen's Club on Political Reform that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> formed in January, said, `` It is important for him -LRB- the prime minister -RRB- to apologize and make his responsibility clear'' in the Recruit case. `` The very idea of a politician making money through stock transaction is wrong,'' said <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The panel also urged <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to accept opposition demands to summon his predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to testify about his role in the affair. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said Friday, `` Since this problem surfaced during my term in office I can not turn my back on it. We must work to restore the public trust by initiating political reforms.'' Opposition parties have stalled parliamentary debate on the country's budget since Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> rejected their demands that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign or summon <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for questioning.

 State Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> testified at his impeachment hearing Friday that he received documents showing massive losses in the state's consolidated investment fund but did n't pay attention to them. Stating repeatedly `` I'm not a financial expert,'' the two-term Democrat said he did not understand investment reports that crossed his desk and had no idea the fund lost $ 279 million until late November or early December 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has heard more than 50 hours of testimony in the past two weeks, is to vote next week on whether the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> should impeach <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>. If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does so, the treasurer would be tried by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, the last witness scheduled to appear before the committee, said he depended on his staff to handle the investment division in his office and that then-Associate Treasurer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> and then-investment director <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> kept the losses from him. `` The system failed,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said. `` The checks did n't check. The balances did n't balance.'' Since the losses became public, <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said, he has been keeping a close eye on the investment division. But when Delegate <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> how much the investment division made or lost last week, <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> would not answer. `` We can get you a report on that,'' the treasurer said. The losses occurred when the bond market took a nosedive in April 1987, and the treasurer's office traded extensively to keep the losses at a minimum, other witnesses have testified. Instead, the losses continued to mount. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> also was questioned Friday about a report he said was sent to his office that showed the investment fund losing millions of dollars in June 1987. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> expressed some confusion about the meaning of the document and why some figures were shown in parentheses _ a common method of showing losses on financial documents. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said he paid no attention to the report when he received it, even though 87 of 90 figures on it indicated losses. `` All these reports look alike,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said. `` I am not a financial expert. I hired the best management team available.''

<HEAD>Foreign Language: A Complicated and Controversial Award</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Of all the nomination processes that lead to Academy Awards, none is more complicated _ or controversial _ than the foreign language film award. It's commonly called the `` foreign film'' award. Not so. Nominees must be in a language other than English, hence films from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> -LRB- except for Canadian films in French such as the recent `` The Decline of the American Empire'' -RRB- are not eligible in this category. The controversial part of the foreign language award stems from the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and its voters have no control over the nominations. The countries themselves can nominate one film per year. The system has been criticized for its inequities. Critics claim that governments, especially military or communist dictatorships, sometimes refuse to nominate films showing those countries in a bad light. Politics in the selection committee can also eliminate likely choices. Three years ago <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurosawa </PERSON>'s widely acclaimed `` Ran'' was not submitted because of wrangling among Japanese committee members. The directors branch of the Academy rallied to the great filmmaker and nominated him for best director. This year's nominations for the foreign language <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> managed to dodge controversy. Two of the entries stand out: <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' which has attracted rave reviews; and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s `` Pelle the Conqueror,'' winner of the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> prize for best picture. `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' written and directed by <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>, concerns two <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> women whose personal and professional lives are in chaos. The comedy has been a big success in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- $ 4.4 million in 17 weeks of limited release -RRB-, and critics have compared it to the screwball comedies of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarey </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The star, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maura </PERSON>, is not surprised by the American response. Her friendship with <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON> goes back to when he worked for the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> telephone company and she was a television talk-show hostess. `` When I began to work with <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> 10 years ago and we had a very special situation together,'' she said during a visit here, `` I said to him: ` Hey, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, do n't worry, because in one time the Americans will understand you.' `` I am very proud of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>. I think he's very genuine. His sense of humor is very American sometimes, and mine also. So I understand why you Americans like ` Women on the Verge.''' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, who stars in `` Pelle the Conqueror'' along with young <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hvenegaard </PERSON> as his son, also has high praise for his director, Danish Bille August. `` He's very, very sensitive and has a great hand with people, especially children. Very soft-spoken, he seems almost shy. But he's a brilliant man, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what he'll do in the future `` Pelle'' -LRB- $ 1.1 million during 11 weeks of limited domestic release -RRB- concerns a Swedish peasant who brings his son to a Danish farm, where the father endures a series of indignities as a lowly worker. The film was shot on the bleak landscape during one of the coldest winters in decades. `` It looks more rugged than it really was,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> said. `` We had to spend a few cold days and nights out in the open, but thank God, we had warmth nearby.'' `` Hanussen,'' the entry from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, is the third of three impressive films by <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Szabo </PERSON> on themes of human folly and free will. The first, `` Mephisto,'' won the Oscar for foreign language film of 1981. The second was nominated in 1985. All three star <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandauer </PERSON>, known to American audiences as <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>'s husband in `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brandauer </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanussen </PERSON>, whose apparent genius for telepathy makes him a theatrical star in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. His fame leads him into the inner circles of Nazi power, with unexpected results. `` <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>,'' directed by <PERSON> Mira </PERSON> <PERSON> Nair </PERSON>, is the nominee from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, earning $ 1.8 million during 22 weeks of limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> release. Filmed with grim realism, the story concerns a young boy who is abandoned by his family to the streets of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, where he consorts with thieves, drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps. The Belgian entry is `` The Music Teacher,'' directed by <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbiau </PERSON>. The story concerns a vocal coach imposes his strict discipline on two singers, entering them into a competition sponsored by a wealthy patron who hates him.

<HEAD>Supporting Actor: Will A Film Vet Do It Again?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 If the Academy Award race for supporting actor goes according to form, the winner would be <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> for `` Little Dorrit.'' Or so the experts say. After all, the reasoning goes, for the past three years the award has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work: <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>, `` Cocoon,'' 1985; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters,'' 1986; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, `` The Untouchables,'' 1987. The trouble is that Academy Award voters do n't always follow tradition, and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the six hours of `` Little Dorrit.'' The British-made film is based on <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' last, often overlooked novel. Guinness, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winner as best actor for `` The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, was cast as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrit </PERSON>, longtime resident of debtors' prison. `` The character itself I found fascinating,'' said the 74-year-old actor in a magazine interview, `` because in many ways it's unsympathetic, feckless and foolish. You know, you'd like to kick him. ... And yet, at the same time, there is a sympathy for him because of the social situation at that time, being chucked into prison for 20-odd years for debt.'' But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, nominated for `` Tucker: The Man and His Dream. For 30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such as `` North by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cleopatra'' and `` <PERSON> Nevada </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>,'' though he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV series `` Mission: Impossible.'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> the role of his life as <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON>, financial adviser to car builder <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. Of <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, 54, remarks: `` Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you, that's a vote of confidence. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> really creates a background for you. The more you bring the happier he is.'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> is a director of the Actors Studio in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, and he prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an illustrator for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, he drew portraits of <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> and analyzed him as `` a lonely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman who really has no family, no friends and no life outside work.'' Then there's <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, nominated as the outrageous Mafia don in `` Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52 years. The son of singer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was a child actor in such films as `` Anchors Aweigh,'' `` Gentleman's Agreement'' and `` The Boy With the Green Hair.'' His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after his child-star days; success as a young man in `` Compulsion,'' `` Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act, but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, moved to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> credits director <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> for taking a chance on him in `` Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: `` No one had ever thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and neurotics and sensitive people.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> won his nomination as the madcap but vicious underworld type in `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>.'' Known for his flamboyant roles in the theater, <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, 41, has created a series of indelible performances on the screen: as <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>'s erratic lover in `` Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in `` The Big Chill''; the swashbuckling buccaneer in `` The Pirates of Penzance.'' The actor believes that his screen potential has n't been reached: `` I've done tons of roles on the stage that I have n't even approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures, comedies No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that way.'' The youngest nominee is 18-year-old <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, named for his `` Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the run from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> has established himself as one of the screen's best young actors in such films as `` Stand by Me,'' `` The Mosquito Coast'' and `` Little Nikita.'' As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the move, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in `` Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing was good training for acting. `` I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go from film to film,'' he said. `` It also gives you an insight on different forms of life and different perspectives.''

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Feuchter </PERSON> lovingly taps the bright yellow bulldozer awaiting finishing touches on the <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> production line. `` You can hardly point to a part on there that is n't steel,'' he says. Steel is the backbone of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s business, and nobody knows it more intimately than <PERSON> Feuchter </PERSON>, who buys 500,000 tons a year of the metal that winds up in the formidable earth-moving machines under the CAT name. As it searches for the cheapest materials available, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> finds itself at odds with its major supplier, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry, over quotas that limit imports of foreign steel. Twenty percent of the half-million tons of the steel <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> uses annually comes from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries overseas. The company joined, by a coalition of about 250 mostly small manufacturers, is fighting efforts to extend the quotas. It is a fight not just about trade but about politics. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a campaign promise to renew the so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements -LRB- VRAs -RRB- when they expire Sept. 30, and 54 senators are co-sponsoring legislation to extend for five years the VRAs, which limit the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and 19 other countries to a 20 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. Despite complaints from the steel industry, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to subject <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to the VRAs in 1984. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, is an ardent champion of free trade and a foe of what he calls the `` fool's gold'' of protectionism. Indeed, in the same letter to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., pledging to support continuation of the VRAs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also vowed to press for an international consensus on fair trade that would eliminate the need for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> barrier Even now, top-level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trade and economic officials are debating internally just how long the extended VRAs should last and what types of steel they should cover. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> has echoed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sentiments that the VRAs are a stopgap and the real goal is to end the subsidies, dumping and closed markets that distort the price of steel. It is the first major test of trade policy for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insists on some protective barrier to shelter its steel industry, how much force will it carry when it insists on dismantling the barriers that protect farmers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? Political realities at home may force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before him, to temper disdain for protectionism against the pressing need to rein in the $ 137 billion trade deficit and bolster a vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry that saw 290,000 jobs disappear in the past decade. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry is operating today at 89 percent of capacity, rolling up profits of $ 3 billion in the past two years after being staggered by losses of $ 12 billion in the previous five. Caterpillar and its allies charge the VRAs will force <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to pay artificially high prices for the next five years, impairing their ability to sell goods here and abroad. The VRAs `` cost us dearly,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Matic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalforming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we are ever going to get the trade deficit down, people in manufacturing are going to have to start shipping product out of this country. But before we can do that, we've got to have the material.'' But the steel industry counters vehemently that what is at stake is the survival of the American mills, still struggling to regroup and modernize after the calamitous downturn in the first half of the 1980s. `` The VRAs are in the long-run interests of -LRB- American -RRB- consumers as well as producers,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, a former deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative leading the industry fight. `` Obviously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> everyone wants to buy everything at the lowest possible price now,'' said <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>. But no other industrialized country `` has considered it acceptable to lose its self-sufficiency in steel.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, president of the USS Division of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel maker, put it more bluntly at a recent <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> debate on VRAs. `` If we keep putzing around with this VRA question ... more of the industry -LRB- will -RRB- liquidate, and there will be all this handwringing about allocation,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. Caterpillar and its coalition notwithstanding, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> claimed that `` 95 percent of our customers are with us'' in support of the import quotas. `` They've seen a third of the domestic steel industry liquidate -LRB- and -RRB- they know that process can continue. It's in their enlightened self-interest,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

 A few years ago, Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry, was on the industrial critical list. The company lost $ 953 million in 1982-84 and saw <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> pose a stiff challenge to its world leadership in the heavy construction field. Big Cat battled back by restructuring factory floors, forging a new relationship with workers, and looking for every possible way to lower costs and stay competitive in the world marketplace. Last year it posted profits of $ 616 million on record sales of $ 10.4 billion, half of them abroad. The weaker dollar helped revive <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s fortunes, but company officials say the recovery was also sped by radically altering their production methods to emphasize quality and minimize costs. Stacks of empty parts bins outside one of the Caterpillar plants straddling the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> testify to the company's success in eliminating the need for huge stockpiles of parts Feuchter, manager of central purchasing for <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s steel division, said, `` Our chief needs are high quality materials on time and at the right price. VRAs do n't help any of that. They inhibit our ability to shop the best way we know how.'' While steel prices fell during the first two years under VRAs, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of governmental affairs, said, `` They were overpriced to begin with.'' He cited a study done for the anti-VRA coalition by the <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a trade advisory group headed by former <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, that concluded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers paid an average of $ 5 billion, or 25 percent, more for steel each year from 1969 through 1985 than their counterparts in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Strong worldwide demand has pushed steel prices up since 1986. Caterpillar blames the quotas for helping push up its prices for plate steel 17 percent a year ago, and for inducing shortages of large tractor track shoes that are only made overseas. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> allowed <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> last summer to import an extra 13,000 tons of the steel track shoes because of the short supply.

 `` I do n't have any sympathy for the mills,'' said steel buyer <PERSON> Feuchter </PERSON>. `` I understand what they're going through.

 At <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> Works in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, one of the mammoth mills that line the lakeshore between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, general manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Veitch </PERSON> finds it inconceivable that anyone could accuse the steel industry of not modernizing. `` We're high tech. We're a far more sophisticated industry than people realize,'' said <PERSON> Veitch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986, invested more than $ 325 million to modernize its operations last year. A sizable chunk went to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, which recently opened a $ 76 million ladle metallurgy facility to produce high quality, ultra-low carbon steel. In 1987 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 130 million rebuilding a huge blast furnace at <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and relined a second major furnace last year at a cost of $ 70 million. Five years ago, said <PERSON> Veitch </PERSON>, `` blast furnaces did n't have computers and all these <ORGANIZATION> CRT </ORGANIZATION> screens with all this stuff flashing on them. But today one guy sits in a room and knows what's going on in the whole furnace.'' Behind other weathered, hulking steel facades, small crews sit in computer-lined `` pulpits'' running fiery steel-making operations that once required twice as many workers. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Works </LOCATION> has a continuous casting facility that set a world production record in 1987. Instead of pouring the molten steel into ingots, the caster allows steel to be molded into slabs and sent hurtling down the line like a glowing tobaggan, stretched to thousandths of an inch by rollers and cooled with torrents of water. The steel emerges in hot, rolled coils produced in a fraction of the time and cost of old methods. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s front-line plant that gets the first orders and the first improvements. A sister plant in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> still makes half its steel in ingots and lacks a ladle metallurgy facility. `` We have just begun to scratch the surface of trying to climb back up and become economically viable,'' said <PERSON> Veitch </PERSON>. As an industry, `` we've got to get to 100 percent continuous cast'' instead of the current 65 percent. `` Just from this plant's perspective, I've got a lot more that needs to be done to be truly, consistently world competitive,'' said <PERSON> Veitch </PERSON>, who speaks enviously of advances the Japanese and Europeans have made on hot-strip rolling mills. <PERSON> Veitch </PERSON> is nonplused by the complaints from <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you look at the whole world market situation, we're not out of line in terms of prices,'' the plant manager said. `` We're just approaching levels price-wise that we were at in 1982.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, at the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> building, Inland Director of Corporate Communications <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saran </PERSON> grumbled, `` What do they want us to do? Give our steel away like we did for four years?'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mills boast they are now producing a ton of steel at a lower average cost than any country in the world. Costs are down 35 percent since 1982, productivity is up 40 percent, and quality is greatly improved, they say. The steelmakers say they reinvested $ 9 billion in modernizing plants and equipment between 1982-87, a third more than their cash flow from steel. The <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> legislation requires such reinvestment. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> steel division, said, `` When you see -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> on television announcing a new seven-year -LRB- car -RRB- guarantee, you want to recall that that's made possible by technological innovation in the domestic steel industry.'' `` Nowhere in the world is steel sold at prices as low as it is currently in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said at a recent <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> debate sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` American auto makers are paying about $ 100 per ton less for their domestic steel than <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> is paying in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> senator.

 The rise of the yen and mark have narrowed the once formidable wage gap between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel workers and their foreign counterparts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel workers' wages have risen only 2.5 percent since 1982 to $ 14.78 per hour, according to the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> group _ a fact that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> will emphasize in negotiations to renew labor contracts that expire this July 31 at four of the big six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers. Fringes add almost $ 10 an hour to the steel workers' compensation Steel imports, which claimed 26 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in 1984, dropped to 21 percent in 1988, just above the <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> target level. Some countries did not ship their full quotas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, presumably because they could fetch higher prices elsewhere. While 20 million tons were imported last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel makers exported 2 million tons. In the event that the VRAs are not extended, steel companies are keeping trade law specialists like <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> busy preparing hundreds of unfair trade cases to bring before the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against foreign producers. It was in part the difficulty of trying to resolve a myriad of such disputes through the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> that prompted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to embrace VRAs in 1984. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufbauer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of international finance who favors a phaseout of the VRAs, said the steelmakers want `` insurance against a cyclical downturn or an overvalued dollar in the 1990s.'' But <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> countered that, `` The international conditions that gave rise to the VRAs have not changed significantly.'' `` Steel and the State,'' a 580-page book co-authored by <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, charges the steel industry in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was kept alive only by `` repeated, massive injuections of state aid,'' including $ 35 billion between 1980 and 1985 alone. Currently, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Finsider </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is getting almost $ 6 billion in new subsidies, said <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>. `` Getting plant and equipment at zero cost is an unbeatable competitive advantage,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has a ready answer when asked why the renascent steel industry is putting so much vigor into the fight for VRAs. `` We're at the top of the cycle. This is a cyclical business. And we know it will turn down someday. That's when VRAs are important. They are a soft-market mechanism,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` But they're a political device so you've got to get them in place.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> is n't ready to declare victory. `` It is n't over'til it's over,'' said the co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` Trade disputes are always very chancy.'' Several major newspapers have railed against extension of the VRAs, saying it's time for big steel to stand on its own. Inland's <PERSON> Saran </PERSON> replies, `` We're getting the same kind of misguided editorials from all the newspapers, all of whom are free traders, except when it comes to their own business.'' `` If there was some way tomorrow for the Japanese to set up a competitive newspaper in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and give the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> a run for their money, and they were subsidized by the -LRB- Japanese -RRB- government, guess who's side they'd be on?'' asked <PERSON> Saran </PERSON>. `` They'd probably be on the side of having the laws observed.''

 Bargain prices for coveted airport gates and computer reservation systems. Millions in loans from a debt-swamped airline to its growing sister. Money-losing deals to buy fuel from the parent. In court papers, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' recalcitrant pilots make a strong case that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has plotted to suck <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s blood to buoy non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a key issue as the saga of the strike-decimated carrier moves through bankruptcy proceedings `` Either a sophisticated asset stripping scheme is under way or management is incompetent,'' the pilots state in documents filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week. The pilots cite alleged bargain sales, no-gain loans and money-losing arrangements they say have undermined parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that its affiliated airlines are separate entities. They say <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s management clearly benefited <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s detriment. Eastern, which was losing money long before <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> arrived in 1986, says it transacted above-board, fair-market deals among subsidiaries, with no illicit intermingling of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> blood. Nonetheless, a 59-page court brief filed last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> provides illuminating details that at least raise major questions about Eastern management's behavior. The brief culls information from <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filings, federal court testimony, a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report and company financial records to make the case that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are deeply interwoven. The most striking deal _ `` the red flag on the bull in the bullring'' in the words of one aviation analyst _ was the 1987 transfer of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s coveted computerized reservation system to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for $ 100 million. At the time, the system was worth at least triple that amount. Moreover, debt-swamped Eastern did n't get a $ 100 million cash infusion from the deal, which it badly needed to support day-to-day operations. Instead it got $ 100 million in notes bearing 6 percent interest _ payable in full in the year 2012. Analysts have questioned the financial wisdom of transferring the computerized reservation system to its new sister. Similar networks soon after fetched $ 280 million, $ 500 million and $ 650 million. Eastern maintains it could n't afford to upgrade its network in a highly competitive battle for travel agents, who book tickets through airline-run computers. Eastern says it was paying $ 130 million a year to operate the network, money it now pays to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> for a better product. The question of whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> have been kept separate is central to the bankruptcy proceedings. A judge ultimately could decide whether <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> allowed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to languish and refused to merge the two subsidiaries in an attempt to destroy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> wants to avoid placing its assets on the line to cover <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s more than $ 3 billion in liabilities. `` By keeping the companies separate, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> does n't get the two groups together to be unionized,'' said a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> aviation lawyer who asked not to be identified. `` If he put the two together he would face a situation where if he allowed enough parity of employees that would force an election. `` Then <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has a completely unionized property, which is what he got out of five years ago.'' The pilots' court brief also alleges the following action damaged Eastern: _ Eastern loaned $ 40 million to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> last spring at the same time it was seeking an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> waiver on a $ 105 million contribution to its pension fund Eastern says the loan was repaid. _ For almost two years <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> failed to demand a non-interest bearing $ 16 million payment due for merger-related expenses from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> The inaction cost the airline about $ 2.8 million a year in lost interest earnings. Eastern called it a `` bookkeeping transaction'' that has since been paid. _ In March 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> paid <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> $ 25 million for a note worth $ 30 million owned by nearly bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had previously acquired <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> made $ 4.4 million on the deal. The pilots called it a senseless investment since <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> had no creditworthiness and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> needed to conserve cash. _ Eastern paid $ 22 million to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for strike-related services in December 1987 and another $ 19 million last fall for similar services that have not been used Eastern maintains the money was well-spent. _ <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, the pilots claim, disproportionate gained from a merger of sales offices with Eastern in January 1987 Eastern brought in 166 offices while <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> contributed 27. The arrangement was dissolved last December. _ <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 11 million to Eastern for 11 <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> gates allegedly worth twice as much The court papers compare the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 sale of eight <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, gates to <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25 million. Eastern says it got the market price. _ A fuel purchase agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> costs Eastern about $ 18 million annually but provides no apparent savings, the papers state Eastern claims it saves $ 6 million a year. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> claims the arrangement merges purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, giving them greater clout with suppliers. _ The pending sale of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million will reduce <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s cash flow by $ 30 million to $ 40 million, the pilots say The airline says sale of the shuttle, despite its profitability, is necessary for the airline's survival. The pilots claim downsizing Eastern last year by closing its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hub and selling planes, routes and airport gates as part of $ 130 million in asset sales has hurt profitability while benefiting <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. They also say most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s directors and managers used to work at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> or both _ and do n't have <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s best interests in mind. Another key issue involves <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pension obligations _ put at $ 320 million by the company but $ 750 million by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. Under federal law, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> could be held liable for the total underfunding of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pension plans. If Eastern fails to make a $ 100 million payment due in September, lawyers said, the government could tap money from elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Air structure. To guarantee payment, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> may sell more assets. The pilots' court papers ask Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> to appoint a trustee to run Eastern during bankruptcy proceedings, charging that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would continue dismantling <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and try to break its unions, as he did after taking <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy in 1983. `` It may not win over the long run but it certainly puts a lot of flies in the ointment in terms of trying to get the assets sold piecemeal,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But lawyers said obtaining a trustee is difficult and may be viewed by <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> as unnecessary. Moreover, the judge may not view Eastern management's sale of assets and other actions as irresponsible. `` These asset sales have kept Eastern in business,'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` Without these sales, this company would have gone belly-up a long time ago.''

<HEAD>Inflation Data Spook Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A benign winter for stock market investors is approaching its end with some increasingly chilling worries about inflation. In their strongest sustained performance since the great bull market of 1982-87, stock prices began to rally late in November, gathered strength in January and established new post-crash highs in early February. After a modest pullback, they came on strong again and nearly equaled their February highs this past week. But the upbeat mood in the financial world suddenly took an anxious turn on Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February for the second straight month. Two months' figures do n't make a trend. But anyone who projected the figures out over a full year was bound to stir memories of the dread phenomenon of a decade ago, double-digit inflation. Few economists on Wall Street had considered that as even a remote possibility. Even after the data were in, forecasters believe there is very little chance of an economic replay of the soaring prices seen in the late 1970s. But the widely held belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would succeed in its effort to keep inflation in check without much economic pain has suffered a serious challenge. And some nagging questions took on a new urgency: In a deregulated economy that operates on huge international flows of money, how much power does the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> have to achieve its anti-inflationary goals? Assuming that the mission can be accomplished, what degree of credit-tightening will be needed, and how high will that drive interest rates? Lastly, will the central bank have to squeeze the economy to the point of recession before it sees any evidence that it is getting inflation under control? As traders faced those issues, stocks fell sharply on Friday, giving up nearly all of a strong gain they had amassed earlier in the week, when it looked as though the strains on the economy might be easing. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.57 on Friday, finished the week with a net gain of 10.00 at 2,292.14. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index slipped .19 to 164.66; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 3.71 to 402.19, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 4.16 at 328.36. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 177.28 million shares a day, up from 159.80 million the week before. `` The core inflation rate -LRB- excluding food and energy -RRB-, which is now almost 5 percent, has been inching up consistently since mid-1988,'' observed <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhirud </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Any further increases, either in food commodity prices or crude oil prices, would only worsen inflationary fears. The fact that inventories have been consistently low will only result in further inflationary pressure as reordering may prove to be costly for most businesses. `` It may no longer be an easy task to slow down the economy or reduce inflationary pressures.''

 The government's latest news on inflation has sent investors scurrying for cover like targets of a semiautomatic assault-rifle attack and left stunned economists wondering how high interest rates will go. `` I think of it as the St. Patty's Day massacre,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices surged 1.0 percent in February. `` If this shocks you into thinking we have an inflation problem, that's right.'' The report this past Friday matched a jump in January and translated into an annual wholesale inflation rate exceeding 12 percent, more than triple the level of last year. It incited one of the biggest setbacks of the year for the stock and bond markets, where prices tumbled on fear that inflation is eroding the value of these investments and will require a stiff curative dose of higher interest rates orchestrated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank. The prospect of sharply tighter credit, in turn, signaled a range of potential consequences that included higher mortgage rates, more loan defaults and rising unemployment _ possible elements of a recession. `` If you hold debt that's based on an adjustrable rate, it will raise your monthly expenses,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` As for big ticket items like housing, the higher cost of credit will slow demand for these things.'' On a broader scale, the higher cost of borrowing could derail the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plan for reducing the national debt and budget deficit, which is largely based on economic growth and no tax increases. Rising rates also could intensify problems faced by hundreds of sickly thrifts by driving up their own business expenses and the cost of a federal bailout program already estimated at more than $ 100 billion. The wholesale inflation number deeply disturbed economists not only because it exceeded expectations but affected every major area, from clothing to food to energy expenses. `` The sense here is that the acceleration in inflation has been steady, and the forces keeping inflation going are still in place,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` Everything that's going on here is negative.'' In other business and economic developments this past week: _ Inflation fears were further aggravated by rising oil prices, which surged to the highest level in nearly two years As of Friday, April contracts for a barrel of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude cost $ 20.33 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. _ Despite the inflation news, other government figures indicated the economy is slowing down For February, industrial output remained largely unchanged; factory use fell to 84.3 percent from 84.5 percent a month earlier; housing starts fell 11.4 percent; retail sales fell 0.4 percent; imports and exports declined in January. _ New twists complicated a bitter strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with no sign of resolution In bankruptcy proceedings, pilots and machinists accused management of deliberate negligence and sought a court-appointed trustee to run the airline. Management won an emergency court order directing other carriers to honor pre-strike business agreements. Union officials talked of a possible employee-led buyout. _ <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, target of the biggest successful takeover in history, got a new chief, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive On a smaller scale, a partnership including actor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, who portrayed a sophomoric philanderer in `` Animal House,'' acquired control of the company that produced the hit film, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lampoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Bondholders Rights May Be Emerging Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``BondReview,'' one word, is cq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There's been much talk in the last few years of shareholder rights. Now the financial markets may be seeing the emergence of a new movement: bondholder rights. The recent experience of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> when it redeemed several bond issues as part of its plan to go private shows that some bondholders no longer will sit by passively while a corporation restructures. When <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> announced it would redeem the bond issues before maturity as part of its $ 1.46 billion, management-led buyout, major institutional holders of the securities banded together, hired an adviser and went to battle with the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, chemical and building-products company until it raised the bond-redemption prices several times. `` The bondholders were able to receive a reasonable premium and not have to suffer any losses,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> BondReview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> bondholder group. In order to undertake the buyout, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> needed the approval of the holders of three issues of its high-yield, or `` junk,'' bonds. Covenants written into the bond issues required the approval of the bondholders before the company could restructure, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. Such covenants typically restrict a company from incurring additional debt without bondholder approval. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay the bondholders a fee for their consent to disregard the covenants, and at the same time buy back their bonds. But some institutional holders of the bonds, primarily insurance companies, believed the bonds were worth more than <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> was offering, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. With his help, they formed a group and decided not to tender their bonds right away. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> responded by raising its tender offer, but not by much, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. `` They were testing to find out if a group had been formed,'' he said. `` Nobody tendered.'' The bondholder group then negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, and reached agreement on the price <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> offered for the bonds and for the consent fee, or the amount it paid for bondholders to relinquish their right to reject <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring. `` By forming these groups and staying together and by a reasonable negotiation position with the company, bondholders increased their payment by about $ 20 million'' overall for the three bond issues involved, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. He said the sweetened offers represented improvements ranging from 5 percent to 8 percent for each of the bond issues compared with the first <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> offers. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on the bond redemption. An unidentified <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> official told <PERSON> Bondweek </PERSON>, a weekly trade newsletter, that the final <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> offer for one of the bond issues `` wound up being more expensive than we planned.'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said one important reason for bondholders to negotiate as a group is that if the company receives approval from holders of 51 percent of its bonds, it can undertake the changes barred by the bond covenants. For example, he said, if holders of 51 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> bonds agreed to give up their covenant rights, holders of the other 49 percent would face the prospect that their bonds would be worth less as the company incurred more debt during a buyout. `` You've got a potential tyranny of the majority over the minority,'' he said. Some bond market analysts believe more bondholders will become more active in protecting their interests because of corporate restructurings. In addition to enforcing covenants in existing bonds, investors increasingly are demanding that new issues contain covenants protecting them from managements that load up on debt. `` Institutional investors are looking at the way things are going these days and are deciding not to take a passive attitude,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the security-rating company. Several industry watchers pointed to the recent leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a turning point in bondholder awareness. `` A lot of big investors in <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> thought they had been unfairly treated,'' <PERSON> Blitzer </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> had completed a debt issue shortly before the leveraged buyout was announced. `` People thought they were given the short end of the stick.'' The rating of some <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> debt fell after the company's debt-financed buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Two major <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bondholders, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s insurance subsidiary, sued the company for alleged damage to the value of `` Clearly, bondholders are becoming more active in standing up for their rights, and that has been especially true since the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LBO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, an executive editor of <PERSON> Bondweek </PERSON>. `` I do n't mean to say that <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> treated its bondholders badly,'' he added. `` It was just that people though <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> was a safe bet because it was so big.''

 As veteran Fire Department paramedics working some of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s meanest streets, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzzardo </PERSON> thought they'd seen just about everything. Then they they took part-time jobs staffing the medical office at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` The one I'll never forget,'' said <PERSON> Guzzardo </PERSON>, `` is the time a guy came in here with part of a pencil sticking out of his chest. I mean, it gets rough in the -LRB- trading -RRB- pits every so often, and we get lots of guys stabbed with pencils. `` Hands are pretty common and every once in a while, a guy will get stuck in the face. But this guy got it in the chest and the poor guy was panicking so much, we pulled it out ourselves instead of sending him over to the hospital. `` And as soon as we finished bandaging him up,'' <PERSON> Guzzardo </PERSON> said, `` he puts his jacket back on and went back to trade.'' <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> nods, then adds, `` Thank God they're making pencils out of graphite. `` Because if they were still using lead, we'd have lost a few guys.'' To be truthful, a typical day at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s medical office, located just a few stops down the marble-paneled hallway from the coat room of the sprawling futures market, is less like an episode of the television series `` M.A.S.H'' than a commercial for <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> appliances. An average of 10 to 15 traders find their way into the office each day, about half for what amounts to regularly scheduled maintenance and the other half for `` cuts and bruises, flu, your normal stuff,'' said <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>. `` We monitor about 200 guys on a regular basis ... blood pressure, headaches and dizziness, the occasional diabetic. The funny thing,'' he said, `` is that people probably guess with all the pressure and high stakes around this place, we'd get lots of guys coming in ... hyperventilating and such. `` But I've been here since they opened the office and never once has a guy come in here, sweating or bug-eyed or anything and said, ` Jeez, I just lost my shirt.' `` Most of the guys with a history of high blood pressure or heart troubles are under the regular care of the doctor. We see them at the beginning of the day or the end,'' he said. `` You can never get a feel for what's going on in the pits by what happens in here.'' The medical office was created in 1978 in case of health emergencies at the fast-growing exchange, a leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> center for trading futures contracts in items that range from grains to soybeans to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. Today if offers a range of services and equipment far beyond its humble origins. In the beginning, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> notes, pointing to a small photo on the wall, the `` office'' was a cabinet with a single oxygen tank inside. Today, it boasts emergency life-support and state-of-the-art heart and respiratory monitoring systems and is staffed by six <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> paramedics working on a revolving basis during their 36 hours between shifts. Despite having worked at the Board of Trade for 10 years, <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said he does little other than keeping abreast of how some of the commodities traded there might be doing _ strictly for the sake of conversation _ and `` does n't dabble.'' `` No way,'' he said. `` You might hear somebody say something about this or that or the other, but it's something I'd never get into. `` Look,'' he added, `` I've got more than enough stress in my regular job.''

 Retail giant <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in the midst of an overhaul of its operation, has for the first time signed up an outside designer to develop three new lines of house-brand women's wear The move is `` limited in scope,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON>, but has `` tremendous potential. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> occasionally had used outside consultants in the past, she said, but never to the extent of having them handle the entire project. `` It's an indication we're more open to some fresh outside ideas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON> said. `` We're looking at difference approaches to our business.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> tends to be better known for its durable goods than for fashions. The company's recent restructuring moves _ ranging from the marketing of its landmark <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the world's tallest building, to everyday low prices systemwide _ include a move toward increased use of outside name brands. But that move was not so strong in clothing departments, Ms. <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON> said. `` The whole store still has more private that national brands, but in apparel even more so,'' she said. The new lines will be private-label merchandise from <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, owned by a group of the nation's largest department stores Ms. <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON> said the new sportswear lines from <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> are to include Premises, fashionable separates at `` better prices''; <LOCATION> Middlebrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, offering more traditional styles; and a third line, not yet named more, of larger apparel. While Premises is a little more upscale than the clothing traditionally offered <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' women customers, `` none of it is a departure for us,'' she said. `` It's still Sears.''

 Oil prices zoomed past the $ 20 a barrel mark for the first time in 19 months, capping a five-day rally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark grade of crude oil, hit $ 20.33 a barrel on Friday, the highest level since Aug. 14, 1987 when crude prices closed at $ 20.57. The contract closed at $ 19.84 in the previous session. On Monday, crude prices crossed a resistance level of $ 19 after fluctuating in the $ 18 range the previous two weeks. Since Friday when the contract stood at $ 18.50, prices have risen $ 1.83, driven by several reports pointing to a decline in available raw petroleum, traders said. `` This week had one piece of bullish news after another in a market that is technically strong,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, vice president in charge of energy brokering for <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The reports indicated: falling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventories; a tightening of crude oil supplies in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil-producing region; problems in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> that temporarily disrupted production at a large Norwegian oil complex; and sharp cutbacks by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, unleaded gasoline for April delivery declined 0.21 cent to 55.62 a gallon and April heating oil fell 0.26 cent to close at 53.57 cents. Traders said April and May gasoline prices were under pressure from Friday's announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> would not enforce new higher octane rules for some northeastern states until after June 1 instead of May 15 as previously announced. Traders said the strong showing on the April crude oil contract was due largely to short covering _ or buying to repay borrowed positions _ in advance of the contract's expiration on Monday when many players will be out of the market for a national petroleum refiners conference. `` There was a definite reluctance to sell. People were buying,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Piasio </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. May crude rose 24 cents and June advanced 13 cents, with smaller gains for second-half contracts Traders said investors remained uncertain about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions after June, when the cartel's current production quota expires The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has n't revealed whether it will raise or lower output for the rest of the year, although speculation is that the cartel will boost production slightly. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to its current quota of 18.5 million barrels a day last November after the cartel flooded the market with oil and prices sank to 1986 lows. Since the accord, prices have risen more than $ 5 a barrel.
